My father'slove of books continued till the last. Heread, and heard reading, on the day on whichhe expired. My residence in Boston en-abled me to procure books for his perusal,and it afforded me great pleasure to be thuspermitted to gratify my honored parent.When, after the deathof my father, Ireturned to Boston, my mind was depressedwith my recent losses.But I was sensiblethat I was still favored with many inestima-ble privileges. Mr Buckminster had beenso kind as to introduce me to a number ofhis acc[uaintances, who treated me with thatgenuine kindness which is the essence oftrue politeness.Among the number of those excellentfriends, to whom Mr Buckminster was sokind as to introduce me, I would particular-ly recognise Mrs Dearborn, and Mrs Win-4*42LIFE OFthrop, who shone in the circles of polishedlife, and adorned their eminent stations bytheir engaging manners, and highly cultiva-ted minds ; and still more, by their christianThey werevirtues.blessingsthosearound them ; and for a course of years fa-vored me with their attention, and kind offi-ces.
