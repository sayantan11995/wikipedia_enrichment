CHAPTER  II.Until I had attained the twentieth yearof my age, my reading had chiefly consistedof works of imagination and feeling ; such asEven the religious w^orksnovels and poetry.I perused were chiefly devotional poetry, andsuch works as Mrs Row^e's Devout Exercises,and the lives of persons who w ere eminent-I was al-ly distinguished for their piety.most a stranger to controversial works, andhad never examined the points in dispute be-tween different denominations of Christians.But at length an incident in my life gave adiflerentturn to my literary pursuit.While I was engaged in learning Latin andGreek, one of the gentlemen who taught mehad by him a small manuscript from Brough-ton's Dictionary, giving an account of Armin-ians, Calvinists, and several other denomina-tions which were most common. This awak-ened my curiosity, and I assiduously engag-MISS HANNAH ADAMS.11ed myself in perusing all the books which Icould obtain, which gave an account of theI soon becamevarious sentiments described.disgusted w^ith the want of candor in theauthors I consulted, in giving the most unfa-vorable descriptions of the denominationsthey disliked, and applying to them the namesof heretics, fanatics, enth usiasts, &c. I there-fore formed a plan for myself, made a blankbook, and wrote rules for transcribing, andadding to, my compilation.But as I w^asstimulated to proceed only by curiosity, andnever had an idea of deriving any profit fromit, the compilation went on but slowdy, thoughI was pressed by necessity to make every exer-tions in my power for my immediate support.During the American revolutionary war, Ilearned to wTave bobbin lace, which was thensaleable, and much more profitable to me thanspinning, sewing or knitting, which had pre-viously been my employment.At this pe-riod I found but little time for literary pur-But at the termination of the Amer-suits.ican war, this resource failed, and I was againleft in a destitute situation.

Besides, it was apleasant amusement. One of these younggentlemen was the Rev. Mr Clark, of Norton,who pursued his studies with me till he en-tered Cambridge University, and has contin-ued his friendship for me during life ; andhis uniform excellent character I have everIhighly appreciated.The difficulty of taking in such kinds ofwork as I could do, for I was not, like mysister, ingenious in all kinds of needle work,induced me, as the last resort, to attend to mymanuscript, with t]ie faint hope that it mightbe printed, and afford me some little ad-I was far from bemg sanguine asvantage.to the result, even if I accomplished this ob-MISS HANNAH ADAMS.13ject, I had been in the habit of employingmyself very diligently for trifling profits, andthose who are in easy circumstances cannotform an adequate idea of the lively satisfac-tion I felt, when I could procure any workby which I could earn a few shillings.Thiskind of enjoyment, which Providence hasgiven to the poor, appears intended to softenthe many difficulties in their situation.I was sensible, that, in printing my manu-script, I had various obstacles to encounter.It w^as difficult to procure proper materialsfor the work in my sequestered abode.I feltthat my ignorance of the world, and littleacquaintance with business, would put me inthe power of every printer to whom I mightI, however, resumed my compilationapply.on an enlarged scale, which included a fewof the reasons which the various denomina-tions give in defence of their different reli-Stimulated by an ardentgious systems.I entered into the vast field ofcuriosity,religious controversy, for which my earlyreading had ill prepared me.I perused allthe controversial works I could possibly obtain214LIFE OFwith the utmost attention, in order to abridgewhat appeared to me the most plausible ar-As I readguments for every denomination.controversy with a mind naturally wantingin firmness and decision, and without thatpertinacity which blunts the force of argu-ments which are opposed to the tenets wehave once imbibed, I suffered extremely frommental indecision, while perusing the variousand contradictory arguments adduced by menof piety and learning in defence of their re-Sometimes myspective religious systems.mind was so strongly excited, that extremefeeling obliged me for a time to lay aside myNotwithstanding it requiredemployment.much reading to perform my task, the pain-ful feelings I suffered while preparing mywork for the press far outweighed all theReading much religious con-other labor.troversy must be extremely trying to a female,whose mind, instead of being strengthenedby those studies which exercise the judg-ment, and give stability to the character, isdebilitated by reading romances and novels,which are addressed to the fancy and imagi-MISS HANNAH ADAMS.15nation, and are calculated to heighten thefeelings.After my View of Religions was pre-pared for the press, the difficulty still remain-ed of finding any printer willing and able toprint it without money immediately paid.But at length, after various perplexities, thiscompilation was put to the press in 1784.The profit to myself was very small ; for, asit might well have been expected from myfather's inexperience in the business of bookmaking, he was completely duped by theprinter, in making the bargain.After beingat the trouble of procuring upwards of fourhundred subscribers, all the compensation 1was able to obtain, was only fifty books ; andI was obliged to find a sale for them, afterthe printer, (whose name, out of respect toceived all the subscri})tion money.his descendants, I omit to mention,) had re-As mybooks sold very well, the printer must havemade something handsome by the publica-tion.The effect ofso much reli-gious controversy, which had been veryreading16LIFE OFtrying to my mind, was extremely prejudicialto my health, and introduced a train of theI was atmost painful nervous complaints.length brought so low, that the physician whoattended me supposed I was in a decline.But after a tedious interval of extreme suffer-ing, I began gradually to recover ; and after-wards found my complaints were increased,by following the injudicious advice of thephysician who attended me. To the skilland attention of my friend Dr Mann, former-ly of Wrentham, I owe, under Heaven, thepreservation of my life at this period.Soon after I began to recover, I received aletter from the printer of my View of Reli-gions, informing me that he had sold thegreatest part of the edition, and was aboutto reprint it; and requesting me to inform himI Avished to make any additions to myAs I had the precaution to secure thework.copy- right, agreeably to the law passed inifMassachusetts, 1783, I returned a laconic,answer, forbidding him to reprint it ; andhe finally relinquished the design.The information, that the first edition ofMISS HANNAH ADAMS.17my View of Religions was sold, gave me theidea of reprinting it for my own benefit.But as I was entirely destitute of pecuniaryresources, ignorant of ihe world, incapable ofconducting business, and precluded from al-most all intercourse with persons of literaturetremely difficult.and information, and consequently destituteof friends who were able and willing to assistme, the execution of the plan was ex-Even the few friends Ihad gained at that time supposed the disad-vantages in my situation too great to encour-age, my undertaking.Instead of assistingme, they considered my plan as chimerical,and depressed my hopes and discouraged myexertions.While I was struggling with embarrass-ments and difficulties, I was involved in thedeepest affliction by the death of the belov-ed sister, whom I mentioned in the preced-I then experienced the keen-ing Chapter.est anguish the human heart can feel in los-ing a friend.Dearer than life, or aught below the skies,The bright ideas and romantic schemes2'^18LIFE OFOf perfect love, and friendship, fancy paints,In her I realized.To describe the excess of mj grief on thisoccasion would be altogether impossible.Those, only, who have formed the highestideas of friendship, and have considered theirearthly happiness as dependent upon the lifeof one beloved object, on whose judgmentthey relied, and in whom they found com-fort and support in every difficulty and af-fliction, can form an adequate idea of whati felt on this occasion ; which led me to ex-claim.And is she dead !

WhenI went to Boston forthis purpose, a friendof mine introduced me to the Rev.
