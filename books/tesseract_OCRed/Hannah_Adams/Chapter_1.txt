CHAPTER  I.Being arrived at an age in which I cannotreasonably expect my life will be long con-tinued, at the request of a highly esteem-ed friend I am about to give a concise out-line of my past life ; notwithstanding I amsensible that a retrospect of past errors, faultsand misfortunes, will be exceedingly painful.I was born in Mediield, a country townabout eighteen miles from Boston.

HenceI can recollect uneasiness and pain previousto any pleasurable sensations. My motherwas an excellent woman, and deservedly es-teemed and beloved ; but as her own healthwas delicate, and she possessed great tender-ness and sensibility, I was educated in all thehabits of debilitating softness, which probablyadded to my constitutional want of bodilyand mental firmness.My father's circumstances then appearedaffluent, and it was not supposed I should bereduced to the necessity of supporting my-self by my own exertions.Partly from illhealth, and an early singularity of taste, 1no pleasure in the amusements totookwhich children are generally much attached.My health did not even admit of attending;DMISS HANNAH ADAMS.school with the children in the neis^hborhoodThe country scliools, atwhere I resided.that time, were kept but a few months inthe year, and all that was then taught inthem was reading, writing and arithmetic.In the summer, the children were instructedby females in reading, sewing, and otherkinds of work.
