As he walked over thehusks he stepped on me, but I did not squeal. As he pickedup the haversack, he saw Frank's arm and cried, " The barnis full of d — d Yankees." We heard the click as theycocked their pieces, and thinking it about time to stop furtherproceedings, we lifted up our heads. "Throw down yourarms," was the next order. We explained that we had per-formed that sad duty several months before.After much talk they let us come out.Our captors wereTexas rangers, the hardest looking set of men I ever metdressed more like cowboys than soldiers, armed with sabres,two revolvers each, carbines, besides a lariat hung to theThere were but three of them, and we resolved tosaddle.make an appeal for one more chance.In the most earnestmanner possible we told the story of our long service in thefield, our starvation in prison, our long tramp for libertyand our near approach to our lines, and begged them to letI think we made an impression on them, but afterus go.162NINETEENTH MASSACHUSETTS BEGIMENT.conferring they said, " You are loyal to your side and wemust be to ours, but we will use you well while we have youin charge."The rest of the company came up while we were talking.They had thirty-six prisoners, captured from Sherman'sThese were known as "Sherman's bummers."

The night was as cold as any December night in thenorth, and the guard drew on the old man for a good supplyUnlike our army, they did not go after it butof wood.They built several large fires,ordered it brought to them.and then posted guards for the night.We were in a small space and there were only seven menI believed there was a chance to make a break ifon posts.we could only make the men understand it.Frank and Iformed our plans and began to work them.I had lain downby the side of two prisoners and got them interested, thenstood up, warmed myself, and was sauntering over to thethird, when one of the guards cocked his piece, and said," Yank, you get up on that stump ; I don't like to see youmoving about so much."I tried to explain that I was socold that I could not sleep and must move to keep warm, buthe replied, "I think I shall feel better to see you on that164NINETEENTH MASSACHUSETTS BEGIMENT.So I took the stump and held it until daylight.stump."Another draft was made upon the old man for breakfast, andwe continued the march.The citizens along the route were very bitter, and at timesthe guards had hard work to protect us.

We arrivedThe people expected usat Augusta late in the afternoon.and were in line on each side of the street to welcome us.Old men called us " Yankee-doodles ;" boys called us " Bluebellies;" the women yelled all sorts of vile words. Wemarched up the main street into an old stock yard ; an officer,dressed in the uniform of a captain of our army, stood at thegate, and the first words we heard were, "Halt, d—n you,halt ! Would you go to h—11 in a moment ? " Our Texasguards left us here ; they shook hands with Frank and me,wished us good luck, but reckoned we would have a rightThe " imp of darkness " whohard time with tliis fellow.commanded the place was a Tennesseean, named Moore.He was surrounded by a gang of cut-throats, mostly desert-ers from our army, who, having jumped all the Ijounties pos-sible, had joined his gang ; nearly all were dressed in uniformsof blue.We were turned into a mule pen, and while resting therea boy about seventeen years old, dressed in rebel gray, cameto me and said, " They are going to search you ; if you haveanything you want to save, give it to me." "But you are arebel," I said, "and I can't trust you." He answered that hewas not, only galvanized (had taken the oath) ; that he hadbeen a prisoner at Andersonville and had not courage to holdout, so he had gone over to the other side, but assured methat if I would trust him he would be time.While I hatedthe sight of him for his treason, he was better than the rest.All I had was my diary ;it was very imperfect and of no realvalue ; but in it I had noted the places where we had stopped16GNINETEENTH MASSACHUSETTS BEGIMENT.while out, and I felt if Moore got it the negroes who hadassisted us would suffer, so I gave it to him.Soon after Moore came in. He swore at us collectively,Looking at me he said,by detachments and individually."I swear you look like the breaking up of a hard winter."He drew us into line and the picking began.Frank hadit wa&a corps badge that he had made while at Charleston ;cut out of bone, and was the work of days, but it had to go.As the Tennesseean came to me he said, "That cuss isn'tworth picking," and passed me by. From the men they tookeverything ; pictures of friends at home, and when it was apicture of a lady, coarse remarks would be made.After allthe articles had been taken from their pockets, the orderwas given to take off pants, blouses and shoes, and when wewere turned back into the pen they were nearly naked.The pen was very filthy ; the mules had recently vacated,Moore said, " Make yourselvesand it had not been cleaned.as miserable as possible, and I hope to God not one of youGangs of the roughs camewill be alive in the morning."One of the boys came to me, saying,in and tried to trade." I have a watch that they did not find ; one of these mensays he will give four blankets for a watch, and I think Ihad better let him have it, as we shall freeze to death here."I assured him that he would lose his watch and get noblankets, but he was so cold he could not resist the tempta-tion, and gave the fellow the watch. When he came in againThe wretch knocked him downhe asked for the blankets.and kicked him ; that was all he received for the watch.My galvanized friend turned up again and said they werecoming after my jacket, — that they wanted the buttons.Soon they cameI took it off and laid it under another man.THE CAPTURE AND RETURN TO COLUMBIA.167in and asked for the officer with the jacket, a friend outsideThey shook me and asked wherewanted to talk with him.I repHed, "He lay down over the other side."he was.They carried pitch-pine torches and looked at every man,but failed to find the jacket. We managed to live throughthe night, and in the morning my boy returned the diary,and Frank, two other officers who had been recaptured, andmyself were taken out to be sent to Columbia.As wepassed out I heard one of the gang say, " There is the cusswith the jacket," but he did not take it, and we marched tothe depot.road.The rebels must have entertained an idea that Yankeescould live without food, for they issued no rations to us eitherat night or in the morning, and we were hungry enough toOur train was one of those southern tri-eat a raw dog.weeklies which went from Augusta to Columbia one weekand tried to get back the next, and stopped at every cross-At one place an old negro woman was selling sweetI had a Byam's match paper and bought onewith it.I replied that itwas worth five dollars in Confederate, and she was satisfied.I think she got the best of it, for the thing she sold me fora pie was a worse imitation of that article than the matchpaper was of Confederate money.

We learned that Camp Sorghum had been brokenup and our officers moved to the lunatic asylum.The gateof the new prison swung open, the crowd gathered, expect-ing to see "fresh fish," but instead saw four ragged, dirty, oldtramps. We were received with a grand hurrah, and theygathered around to hear our story. We had been out justfour weeks, and had travelled more than three hundred miles.While we were much disappointed we were not discouraged.Our trip had done us good ; we had gained in flesh, hadthrown oft' the stagnation of prison life and were ready to tryagain. We found many changes inside.Major Dunn andCaptain Hume had received special exchange ; others hadescaped, and the squads were broken. We were assigned tosquad fifteen, composed of men who had escaped, and wewere a fine collection of innocents.Before we escaped fror^ Camp Sorghum an order had beenissued by the rebel commander that if any more escaped theywould put us in a pen, and the removal to Asylum Prisonwas the result.There were about two acres enclosed.
