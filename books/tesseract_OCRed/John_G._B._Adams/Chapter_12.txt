We talked awhile on various subjects,and on leaving he said he would call for me that nisfht.Atmidnight he came, and I went with him to one corner of thestockade, where we were joined by three more. We formeda circle with our hands on each other's shoulders, and I tookthe most solemn obligation ever taken by man.I swore toobey in every particular the orders of my superior officers,to take life if necessary in order to escape, and to kill anyone who should betray us.Our organization was called theCouncil of Ten, as it was governed by ten officers selectedby the captains of the companies. We were divided intocompanies of thirty-two, each commanded by a captain, andsubdivided into squads of eight, commanded by a sergeantthe privates only knew the sergeants, the sergeant knew hiscaptain and the captain the Council of Ten. We had signs,passwords, grips and signals, and a grand rallying cry.
