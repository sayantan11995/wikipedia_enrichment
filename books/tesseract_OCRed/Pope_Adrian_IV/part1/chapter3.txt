WHAT THE AMBASSADOR ASKED OF POPE ADRIAN
THE FOURTH.

ARRIVED in Rome about the end of 1158, or the beginning
of 1159, Rotrodus made known the object of his mission
to Pope Adrian IV.

He thercfore announced to him that the King of France
was thinking of going to Ireland, in company and in con-
cert with Henry, King of England ; and that for this pur-
pose he was continually occupied in mustering an army,
and collecting all things necessary for the expedition.

The object of the two princes was religious.! They
wished to extend the limits of Christendom, to overcome
the barbarism of pagans, to subject to the yoke and power
of Christians apostate hordes who rejected the truth of the
Catholic Faith.

In order the more conveniently to carry out his design,
the King sought the counsel and favour of the Roman
Church. This is why the ambassador begged an encyclical
exhorting the people of the kingdom to join in this kind
of crusade, as also a pontifical diploma by which Adrian
would take the kingdom under his protection during the
absence of the King.

What was. the Pope’s answer to such a strange com-
munication? This is what it is important for us to note.

The Abbé Vervorst, who supposes that Henry sent a special
petition, speaks of his maneuvres thus :—‘‘ He wished to annex Ireland,
and hoped with the help of the Holy Father to succeed. What
motives does he set forth? The interests of the Church, and even of
Ireland itself Henry was a pious monarch, of whom no one spoke
without tenderness of heart, and eyes raised to heaven. Others were
ambitious, seeking their own personal advantage; but he had nothing
in view except the glory of God, and sighed only for the extension of
the Church.— What a happiness for Ireland if it could only find itself
under the sceptre of such a monarch!” Migne’s Histoire Ecclésiase
tique, xxi. 293.—Trans.
