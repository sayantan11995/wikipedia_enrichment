II.
MISSION OF ROTRODUS TO ROME.

THE choice of a negotiator enables us to understand that
the affair which Rotrodus went to treat of at Rome con-
cerned England more than France.

The biography of this prelate is found in Gallia Chris-
tiana, tome XI.—as Bishop of Evreux, p. 557, and as
Archbishop of Rouen, p. 48. In 1158 he was Bishop of
Evreux.

He was an Englishman, son of the Earl of Warwick,
and brother of Roger, likewise Earl of Warwick, and of
Robert of Newburgh. He was consecrated Bishop of
Evreux in 1141, at Rouen. Having assisted at the Coro-
nation of Henry II., he fulfilled various missions for this
prince. In 1157 he signed the charter of Sylvester, Abbot
of Canterbury, who acknowledged the jurisdiction of the
Archbishop over his monastery. In 1163 he assisted at the
translation of the body of St. Edward to Westminster.
Archbishop of Rouen in 1164, he continued to live in the
greatest intimacy with the English court. In 1172 he
crowned, at Winchester, Henry III. and his wife, Mar-
garet, daughter of the King of France. Two years after-
wards he was present at the treaty of peace between Henry
and his sons. (Rymcr, Foedera, tome 1, p. 37.)

Rotrodus was so much the better suited for the mission
with which the two Kings intrusted him to Pope Adrian,
as he had just been one of Henry’s representatives at the
peace negotiations of 1158. Weare thus informed by the
Gallia Christiana, in these terms : “ Circa id tempus, unus
fuit e legatis regis Angliz in negotio pacis tractande, ut
liquet ex duabus epistolis Hugonis episcopi Guessionensis
ad Ludovicum regem apud Quercetanum.” (Tome IV.,

pp. 633 et 635.)
