NNIII.
PELER’S PENCE,

WE come to a new presumption against the Bull of Adrian.
Innocent III. claimed Peter’s Penee from the Bishops of
England, but he never asked the tribute on account of
Ireland. This is evidence to us that the Bull of Adrian,
though entered from that time in chronicles, was not re-
garded in any serious light,

Thus, Pope Innocent wrote to Cardinal Nicholas, Bishop
of Tuseulum and Legate of the Apostolic See in England,
and to Pandolphus, sub-deacon, and one of the Pontiff’s
household, in the following terms : ‘‘ Since every house in
England, as you know very well, ought to give a penny
yearly for the tribute of the Blessed Peter, the prelates of
England, who have collected the tribute in our name, have
disposed of it against the will of the master, and have not
been afraid to keep the greater part of it for themselves ;
they have sent us only three hundred marks, and have
kept more than a thousand in their own hands. Wish-
ing, therefore, that the right of the Chureh may be
guarded, we recommend the matter to your cireumspee-
tion, by the authority of these presents, and we expressly
command you to reeeive at onee from their hands the
Penny,.as they have hitherto paid it, and to oblige them to
it, if necessary, by eeelesiastical censure, without appeal.
You will then formally enjoin upon them from us to pay
the remainder in full. We do not see what title they can
allege in excuse ; they are unable to show a concession
made to them by the Holy See, or to prove a prescription
of a hundred years against the Roman Church, especially
if the times of schism are left out.’?’ (Rymer, Federa, &e.,
I., 189.)
