LoirD05,  Febroary,  1850. 

In  the  good  {Mrovidence  of  God,  Dr.  Achilli  has  ceased  to  he  a 
prisoner  at  Rome.  May  every  Christian  heart  he  lifted  up  in 
gratitude  to  Him  who  has  heard  our  prayers  on  his  behalf! 
I  hasten  to  make  to  you  such  a  report,  as  I  am  able,  of  the  facts 
of  the  case.  It  was  from  the  Annual  Conference  of  the  Dritish 
branch  of  your  Institution,  that  the  Deputation  was  sent  forth, 
wliow  ageo^  God  has  been  pleased  to  employ  for  the  deUver* 
anoe  of  the  captive.  You  are,  therefore,  entitled  to  know  not 
&lt;RiIy  the  results,  but  the  course,  of  their  proceedings.  The 
knowledge  of  all  the  circumstances  will,  I  hope,  confirm  you  in 
the  behef  that  the  work  to  which  yon  are  pledged,  in  the  Evan- 
gelical Alliance,  is  not  only  one  of  abstract  truth,  but  of  practical 
ntihty. 

The  statement,  witli  tho  details  now  presented,  is  compiled 
from  the  letters,  joumalH,  rejxjrts^  and  other  documents,  in  the 
pfWMMiiin  of  the  Deputatkm.  It  has  been  (by  the  consent  of 
my  ooQe^pMs)  drawn  up  by  myself  alone,  and,  therefore,  upon 
my  penonal  responsibility.  Residing  in  different  parts  of  the 
ooontrj,  it  was  not  easy  for  us  to  meet ;  as  would  have  been 
neoensry  in  oms  a  report  had  been  issued  to  the  construction 
of  whieh  all  dboold  bare  been  parties.  The  presmt  work  does 
not  pretend  to  be  more  than  a  report  of  fiicts, — designed  for 
those  who  are  tnterasted  in  the  sabject  of  them.  It  was  at  6rst 
advertised  by  the  title  of  the  ''Gospel  in  Rome;**  but,  on 
BWidMatiup,  I  feit  that  meb  s  mme  wm  prasamptuoas,  as  it

might  lead  persons  to  expect  a  more  graphic  description  of  the 
general  state  of  Rome  than  I  am  able  to  furnish.  While  the 
present  sheet  goes  to  press,  Dr.  Achilli  has  not  reached  Eng- 
land; and  even  when  he  does  so,  he  will  relate  himself,  for 
better  than  I  could  do  at  second  hand,  the  history  of  his  un- 
happy country,  both  rehgious  and  secular,  during  the  year  1849. 

I  beg  you,  therefore,  to  accept,  as  it  is,  the  unpretending 
publication  wliich  I  now  present  to  you  j  making  allowances  for 
the  circumstances  under  which  it  appears,  and  especially  for  my 
anxiety  to  lose  as  little  time  as  possible  in  meeting  the  general 
demand  for  information. 

I  take  this  opportunity  of  publicly  expressing  the  obligation 
under  which  all  the  friends  of  Religion  and  of  Freedom  are  laid 
to  His  Excellency  the  Marquis  of  Normanby,  our  Ambassador 
at  Paris,  whose  conduct  has  been,  throughout,  worthy  of  his 
character  as  a  British  man  and  a  British  statesman.  To 
Mr.  Freeborn,  our  Consular  Agent  at  Rome,  whose  efforts 
have  been  indefatigable,  our  thanks  are  also  eminently 
due.  And  I  trust  it  will  not  be  wrong  to  add  to  the 
names  of  those  who  have  claims  on  our  gratitude,  that  of  Lord 
Palmerston,  whose  wish  I  believe  to  have  been,  from  the  first, 
that  our  representatives  abroad  should  aid  the  cause  of  Dr. 
Achilli,  as  far  as  was  compatible  with  the  respect  due  to  the 
independence  of  the  powers  concerned. 

The  late  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  in  France,  M.  de 
Tocqueville,  has,  since  he  left  office,  continued  to  take  a  lively 
interest  in  the  case  j  and  his  kindness,  therefore,  deserves  special 
mention.  Nor  should  I  be  doing  justice  to  pubhc  men,  if  I  did 
not  express,  generally,  the  gratitude  due  to  the  French  Govern- 
ment, for  having  done  all  in  their  power  for  Dr.  Achilli's  liberation. 
The  difficulties  of  their  position,  being  originally  of  their  own 
creating,  may  not  be  easily  understood  in  England,  but  they  are 
very  real; — and  such  is  the  state  of  parties  in  the  National 
Assembly,  that  the  Government  would  not  have  been  supported 
in  that  quarter,  if  they  had  forcibly  liberated  Dr.  Achilli.  As 
it  is,  they  obliged  the  Cai'dinals  (I  suppose,  by  intimations  of  the 
possibility  of  exposure)  to  enter  into  an  official  agreement  to 
open  the  prison  doors.    And  when  that  compact  was  broken.

they  aooompluhed  the  object  themael'resy — ^knowing  that  the 
CAM  against  the  Roman  Goremmaat  was  so  strong*,  that  it  will 
have  the  wisdom  not  to  protest  against  the  ahstractioQ  of  their 
prisoner.  For  this  result,  thoug*!!  tanlily  obtained,  it  would  be 
ongSDerans  not  to  thank  the  Premdent  and  Government  of 
France.  To  Genoral  Baraguej  d'HiUiers  our  thanks  are  also 
due.  It  might  compromise  him  if  I  said  more ;  but  I  should  be 
wanting  in  a  duty  if  I  said  less. 

M.  le  Comte  de  Clasparin,  the  Parliamentary  champion  of 
Protestant  hberties  in  the  late  Chamljer  of  Deputies,  Messrs. 
FMIerio  and  Adolf^  Monod,  with  others  of  our  brethren  in 
Paris,  have  worked  oordiaUy  with  us ; — but  men  engaged  in  a 
oanse  common  to  them  all,  need  not  one  anothers'  thanks.  Duty, 
howvrer,  requires  me  to  say,  that,  but  for  the  investigations  and 
efforts,  at  Rome,  of  Messrs.  Tonna  and  Meyrueis,  our  evidence 
would  have  been  incomplete,  and  our  efforts  unsuccessful.  The 
members  of  the  Alliance  will,  I  trust,  never  forget  how  much  is 
due  to  those  friends,  whose  journey  across  Europe  was  the  means 
of  procuring  that  information  which  led  to  Dr.  Achilli's  deUver- 
ance. 

In  closing  these  prefatory  remarks,  I  cannot  but  express  my 
confidence  that  Dr.  Achilli's  imprisonmeDt  will  open  the  eyes 
of  thousands  to  the  unchanged  and  unchangeable  intolerance  oi 
the  Court  of  Rome.  And  I  hope  my  brethren  in  the  faith  will 
be  stirred  up  to  new  efforts  to  encounter  the  Papacy  with  those 
weapons  which  are  "  not  carnal,"  especially  by  introducing  into 
Italy  those  principles  of  Scripture  truth,  which  are  the  b«^ 
beeanse  the  Divine,  antidotes  to  tyranny  and  Kujwrstition  un  the 
one  hand,  and  to  anarchy  and  infidelity  on  the  other. 

I  b^  you  to  believe  me, 

Your  fiiithful  and  attached  friend,

mPRISONMENT  AND  DELIVERANCE 

or 

DR.    ACniLLI. 


It  is  necessary  to  the  proper  understanding  of  the 
circumstances  of  Dr.  Achilli*s  imprisonment,  to  enter 
somewhat  upon  his  previous  history. 

I  do  not  know  that  this  can  be  better  done  than 
in  the  words  of  a  document  which  he  drew  up,  and 
transmitted  to  his  friends,  in  order  to  its  being  sub- 
mitted to  the  French  Grovemment : — 

Bora  in  Viterbo  in  1803,  educated  in  the  College  of 
Jesnitfi  till  1819,  I  took  in  that  year  the  Dominican  habit. 
I  passed  to  Laccain  1821,  to  prosecute  theological  studies, 
and  I  was  ordained  priest  at  the  court  of  the  Duke  Charles 
Louis.  Called  to  Rome  in  1824,  to  fulfil  the  course  of  my 
studies,  I  was  elected  in  Viterbo,  by  the  bishop  and  by 
the  commune.  Public  Professor  of  Philosophy  in  the  Lyceum 
in  1826.  I  occupied  the  chair,  with  the  other  of  Sacred  Scrip- 
tures, in  a  Seniinary  of  Theology,  till  the  end  of  1833.  In 
that  year  I  was  elected,  by  the  General  of  the  Dominicans, 
Begentor  Prefect  of  Studies,  and  Primary  Professor,  in  the 
College  of  the  Minerva  in  Rome;  and,  contemporaneously, 
I  was  invited  to  become  Professor  of  Sacred  Scripture  in 
the  University  of  Maoerata ;  whilst  Cardinal  Galeffi  ofierod 


8  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

me  a  chair  in  the  Roman  Archi-Gymnasium.  It  was  then, 
and  for  that  sole  cause,  that  I  relinquished  my  chair  at 
Viterbo,  undecided  to  which  of  the  new  offices  I  should 
attach  myself.  There  was  then  given  me  the  charge  of 
Visitor  of  the  Convents  of  the  Dominicans  in  the  Roman 
States  and  in  Tuscany.  I  remained  in  this  office  till  the 
beginning  of  1835,  when  I  was  invited  by  Cardinal  Serra 
to  preach  the  Lent  sermons  in  his  cathedral  of  Capua.  I 
accepted  this  employment  with  the  intention  of  quitting 
Rome,  and  abandoning  the  Institution  of  the  Dominicans, 
with  which,  for  many  good  reasons,  I  was  sufficiently 
disgusted.  It  happened,  in  fact,  in  the  course  of  that 
Lent,  that  I  demanded  and  obtained  my  secularisation  by 
favour  of  the  Pope  Gregory  XVL,  and  by  an  edict  of  the 
Congregation  of  Discipline. 

On  the  eve  of  completing  my  secularisation,  I  received 
a  letter  from  three  cardinals,  entreating  me  to  defer  my 
intention,  and  to  remain  some  time  longer  in  the  Order, 
if  by  this  means  I  could  conquer  my  repugnance.  I  was 
willing  to  be  influenced  by  this  advice,  and  I  remained 
four  years  among  the  Dominicans  of  Naples,  during  which 
time  I  was  seriously  occupied  with  preaching  and  with 
theological  instruction.  However,  in  1839,  I  completed 
legally  my  emancipation  from  the  Dominicans,  and  I 
remained  in  Naples  as  a  simple  priest,  always  preaching 
and  teaching  various  sciences.  It  was  in  1841  that  I  came 
to  Rome  for  my  affairs,  and  I  had  troubles  with  the  Inqui- 
sition ;  the  result  of  which  was,  that,  being  weary  of  serving 
in  the  ministry  of  the  Roman  Church,  I  separated  myself 
entirely  from  that  office,  and  I  made  to  the  Inquisition  my 
renunciation  for  perpetuity  of  all  the  honours,  employ- 
ments, and  privileges  which  I  had  enjoyed  up  to  that  time. 
The  Inquisition,  on  its  part,  drew  up  a  decree  of  dismissal 
for  perpetuity  from  all  the  branches  of  my  ecclesiastical 
ministry ;  and  everything  having  been  completed  which  is 
customary  with  that  tribunal,  I  was  left  to  my  liberty,  and

I  ceased  to  be  a  priest  of  the  Roman  Church.  In  the 
October  of  1842,  I  loll  Italy,  and  entered  the  English 
dominions,  where  I  remained  until  January  of  the  present 
year,  1849 ;  always  occupied  with  the  teaching  of  sciences 
and  literature,  and  so  a  naturalised  subject  of  the  Govern- 
ment of  England,  and  employed  in  the  Malta  College  as 
Professor.  I  returned  to  my  country  again  last  February, 
and  since  that  time  I  have  lived  in  Rome  as  an  honoured 
citizen.* 

During  the  years  in  which  Dr.  Achilli  resided 
at  Corfu  and  at  Malta,  he  published  letters  ad- 
dressed to  two  successive  Popes,  a  translation  of 
which  is  printed  in  an  Appendix  to  the  present  state- 
ment. It  has  been  thought  desirable  to  give  pub- 
licity to  these  letters ;  partly,  because  they  contain 
Dr.  Achilli's  theological  and  ecclesiastical  opinions, 
which  it  will  be  interesting  to  the  public  to  know ; 
and  partly,  and  chiefly,  as  an  incontestable  proof  that, 
when  arrested  at  Rome,  he  was  not  a  Roman  priest 
who  took  a  hasty  refuge  from  the  discipline  of  his 
Church  in  a  nominal  Protestantism,  but  was  an 
evangelicjil  Christian  of  seven  years*  standing. 

The  regard  felt  for  him,  during  his  residence  in 
Malta,  by  his  evangelical  brethren  in  that  island,  is 
manifested  by  the  memorial  addressed  by  them  to 
Lord  Palmerston,  after  his  imprisonment.f     During

10  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

an  early  period  of  his  connexion  with  Malta,  he 
also  visited  England ;  where  he  was  instrumental  in 
collecting  funds  towards  the  establishment  of  the 
Malta  Protestant  College.  In  various  parts  of  this 
country  which  he  visited  for  that  purpose,  he  formed 
friendships  which  have  continued  to  this  time. 

In  the  summer  of  1848,  he  came  again  to  Eng- 
land, to  be  present  at  the  Annual  Conference  of  the 
Evangelical  Alliance,  of  which  body  he  became  a 
member.  His  mind  was  almost  made  up  to  visit 
the  United  States,  in  order  to  present,  in  person,  to 
a  body  of  American  Christians,  a  new  Italian  trans- 
lation of  the  New  Testament,  which  he  had  recently 
made  at  their  request ;  but  the  events  in  his  native 
land  altered  his  determination. 

The  prostration  of  religious  tyranny  in  the 
Roman  States  towards  the  end  of  1848,  seemed 
to  him  a  call  in  Providence  to  return  there.  On 
the  29th  December,  1848,  the  great  bell  of  the 
Capitol  was  tolled  for  the  extinction  of  the  temporal 
power  of  the  Popes.  In  the  second  week  of  January, 
1849,  Dr.  Achilli  left  England  for  Italy,  and  in  the 
first  week  of  February  he  reached  Rome. 

As  I  have  already  said,  I  shall  not  attempt  a 
general  description  of  the  state  in  which  he  found 
his  country.  The  events  of  the  Roman  Repul)Hc 
of  1849  will  form  one  of  the  most  interesting  cliii])- 


INQLANI&gt;~R0MB-HI8  MAURI AQB.  11 

tors  of  Modem  History ;  but  tiiey  cannot  be  made 
an  episode  to  a  personal  narrative.  I  will  merely 
record  my  belief,  tliat  justice  has  not  been  done  to  the 
men  who  ruled  Rome  during  that  difficult  period, 
and  that  the  condition  of  the  city,  especially  in  regard 
to  the  infrequency  of  crime,  presents  a  favourable 
contrast  with  the  times  of  ecclesiastical  dominion. 

It  will  be  interesting,  however,  to  the  friends  of 
Dr.  Achilli  to  know  something  of  the  circumstances 
of  his  residence  in  Rome,  from  February  to  July, 
and  of  these,  a  few  of  his  letters  to  his  friends  in 
England  will  give  an  outline. 

In  order  not  to  interrupt  the  course  of  the  nar- 
rative of  his  evangelistic  efforts  contained  in  these 
communications,  I  will  mention  here,  that  during 
this  period,  viz.,  on  the  24th  June,  Dr.  Achilli  was 
married.  Knowing  that,  in  the  language  of  God's 
word,  "  Marriage  is  honourable  in  all,"  he  was 
united  to  an  English  lady,  educated  in  Italy,  Miss 
Hely,  the  daughter  of  Captain  James  Hely,  with 
whose  family  he  had  been  acquainted  in  England. 
The  union  took  place  in  conformity  with  the  laws  of 
the  then  existing  Republic ;  and  it  is  here  men- 
tioned, because  upon  it  has  been  founded  the  charge 
made  afterwards  against  him  of  "  immorality."  How- 
ever his  marriage  may  be  considered  in  the  technical 
language  of  priestly  discipline,  no  jxjrson  of  com- 


12  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI, 

men  sense  or  Christian  feeling  will  attribute  to  it 
that  character.  The  certificate  of  the  celebration  of 
the  ceremony  will  be  found  at  page  90. 

I  also  take  this  opportunity  of  pointing  out,  that 
though  Dr.  Achilli  naturally  sympathised  with  the 
political  aspirations  of  his  countrymen,  and  availed 
himself  of  their  hostility  to  tyranny  to  excite  their 
attention  to  the  corruptions  of  the  Romish  Church, 
yet  he  rigidly  refrained  from  any  participation  in 
secular  politics.  It  would  be  well  if  the  Roman 
Catholic  priests  in  Ireland  could  say  as  much  !  The 
reader,  in  perusing  these  letters,  will  make  allow- 
ances for  the  position  of  a  Christian  man  in  the 
so-called  "  States  of  the  Church."  It  is  impossible 
for  such  a  person  not  to  rejoice  in  the  overthrow  of 
the  most  hateful  Government  in  Christendom. 

The  reader  must  also  make  allowances  for  our 
friend's  sanguine  expectations  of  immediate  religious 
changes.  These  have  not  yet  been  fully  realised. 
Perhaps,  however,  such  changes  are  nearer  than  any 
party  believes.     The  Word  of  God  is  not  bound  ! 

The  following  are  the  letters  referred  to : — 

DR.  ACHILLI  TO  SIR  CULLING  EARDLEY. 

Rome,  February  7,  1849. 

My  dear  Sir  Culling, 

I  have  been  in  Rome  for  five  days.     The  brethren  of 
Genoa  and  Tuscany  kept  me  some  days  with  them,  that 


POLmCB  AYOIORD-FIRST  LBTTBR  FROM  ROMS.  13 

we  might  be  mutually  comforted  by  each  others'  faith. 
On  the  2nd  instant  I  entered  Rome,  praying  God  to  let 
me  find  this  country  disposed  to  receive  the  good  news  of 
salvation  by  faith  in  Jesus  Christ,  to  have  at  length  mercy 
on  this  people,  buried  for  so  long  in  the  darkness  of  super- 
stition, to  make  Ills  light  shine  on  -this  horizon,  and  to  make 
my  ministry  eflfectual,  that  all  I  propose  to  do  in  the  work  of 
the  Gospel  may  not  be  in  vain.  I  cannot  tell  you  how  much 
consolation  I  have  already  received  from  meeting  several 
persons,  who,  having  been  informed  of  my  change,  ask  mo 
questions  on  religion,  being  desirous  of  knowing  which  is  the 
true  religion  of  Christ,  and  which  is  that  invented  by  the 
Popes.  Imagine  how  my  heart  exults  in  seeing  that  field 
opened  to  me  for  evangelisation,  where  before  I  myself 
falsified  the  language  of  truth.  Our  discussions,  therefore, 
on  the  doctrines  of  the  Holy  Scriptures  are  most  interest- 
ing : — The  faith  which  saves  us  without  any  merit  of  our 
own  works ;  the  Spirit  which  regenerates  us  without  need  of 
sacraments;  the  true  worship  by  which  God  will  be 
honoured  by  us ;  are  all  truths  which  find  access  to  their 
hearts.  I  take  occasion  to  speak  of  these  things  in  every 
place,  with  every  one  I  find  among  the  populace ;  but  I 
Bpeak  separately  to  the  priests,  that  they  may  not  be 
offended  by  hearing  their  faults  reproved  in  the  presence 
of  the  laity.  I  have  already  entered  several  convents, 
and  there  fulfilled  my  mission,  by  carrying  with  me  the 
seed  of  the  Word  of  God,  which  lie  will  make  to  spring 
up,  grow,  and  bear  fruit.  The  day  before  yesterday  I  was 
in  the  midst  of  three  "  Penitentiary"  Theologians  (who 
have  the  power  of  absolving  those  sins  wliich  are  reserved 
for  the  Pope),  two  of  whom  had  been  my  masters  of 
theology  ;  and  I  made  before  them  my  profession  of  faith, 
declaring  myself  a  Christian '  according  to  the  Bible,  and 
summarily  confuting  all  the  errors  of  Popery.  I  surprised 
one  of  them — a  great  friend  of  mine — in  his  own  Confes- 
sional, in  the  Church  of  S— ,  and  there  began 


14  IMPEISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

our  discussion,  which  was  afterwards  continued  with  the 
others  in  the  College  of  the  "  Penitentiary."  I  shall 
have  these  opportunities  every  day,  without  seeking 
them  (I  wiU  certainly  lose  none),  to  render  testimony 
to  my  Lord,  whom  I  have  served,  and  will  serve  as  long 
as  I  Hve. 

I  intend  to  undertake  a  religious  weekly  newspaper, 
and  to  publish  some  tracts.  As  for  the  newspaper,  I  have 
already  found  one  or  two  other  assistants,  and  a  printer 
has  accepted  the  work.  I  must  now  find  the  necessary 
money.  Another  thing  needful  is  a  hall  in  which  to  begin 
prayer-meetings.  Last  Sunday  we  were  three;  next 
Sunday  we  shall  be  six  or  seven;  I  hope  this  number 
will  increase  proportionally,  and  that  we  shall, have  a 
noble  Church.  I  should  wish  to  do  all  these  things 
without  much  delay,  since  we  must  not  lose  the  time  the 
Lord  gives  us.  If  your  Committee  would  do  some- 
thing towards  that  which  is  proposed,  I  should  be  very 
glad. 

Political  afiairs  move  on.  Yesterday  there  was  a  great 
festival  to  celebrate  the  opening  of  the  Constituent 
Assembly.  I  have  never  seen  so  much  joy  among  the 
people  as  on  this  occasion.  The  few  malcontents  did 
not  show  themselves.  To  judge  from  these  good  appear- 
ances, it  may  be  frankly  said,  that  the  Romans  desire  no 
more  Pope  and  no  more  Popery.  Let  God  protect  us,  and 
we  shall  advance  in  His  truth  I  I  hope  that  we  may  go 
back  in  nothing,  but  that,  in  the  name  of  Ilim  who  is  all 
our  salvation  and  all  our  hope,  wc  shall  progress  even  to 
our  celestial  country.    So  be  it ! 

I  am  yours  in  the  Lord, 

G.  ACHILLL 
Sir  Culling  Eardley.

else  you  may  send  me  shall  be  pat  aside  for  the  printing 
of  the  newspaper.*  I  am  going  to  form  a  little  committee 
of  brethren  for  the  administration  of  the  offerings  wo 

receive ;  will  be  the  treasurer.     Till  now  I  have 

not  been  able  to  find  an  Englishman,  because  the  greater 
part  are  going  to  leave  directly  the  winter  is  past ;  and 
of  those  that  remain,  I  see  none  that  sympathise  with 
OS.  Bat  perhaps  I  shall  find  one  in  time.  The  joomal 
cannot  begin  till  we  have  collected  more  funds,  since  we 
wish  to  publish  a  number  each  week,  and  the  expenses  of 
printing,  postage,  &amp;c.,  amount  to  above  £3  each  time. 
Meanwhile,  we  have  thought  of  publishing  flying  sheets, 
irhich  are  stuck  to  the  walls,  and  sold  in  the  streets.  We 
shall  begin  this  week,  and  I  wUl  send  you  some.  I  have 
80  much  to  tell  you  that  I  do  not  know  what  to  choose  for 
a  letter;  I  must  select  the  most  gratifying  for  us,  who 
wish  nothing  so  much  as  to  see  the  kingdom  of  God  spread 
over  the  earth. 

That  will  assuredly  happen  which  I  predicted,  that  the 
so-called  Vicar  of  Jesus  Christ,  having  lefl  Borne,  our 
Lord  would  come  to  take  up  His  seat  here.  The  first 
proof  of  this  fact  is,  that  His  Word  is  published  now  in 
Rome,  and  in  a  month  Diodati's  New  Testament  will  be 
published  in  such  abundance  as  to  be  circulated  in  every

village  of  the  Republic.  It  is  in  this  manner  that  the 
Lord  announces  His  entry  here,  where,  till  now.  His 
greatest  adversary  has  reigned.  The  Bibles  that  I  brought 
with  me  from  Leghorn  are  already,  for  the  most  part,  dis- 
tributed, and  no  day  passes  in  which  some  persons  do  not 
come  to  me  for  them.  While  I  am  writing  these  words, 
two  Franciscan  friars  enter  my  room  to  ask  for  a  Bible 
which  I  promised  them  yesterday.  We  spoke  together  on 
those  words  of  St.  Paul,  that "  Christ  is  made  unto  us  of  God, 
wisdom,  righteousness,  sanctification,  and  redemption." 
The  good  friars  have  promised  me  to  read  every  day  a 
chapter  of  Holy  Scripture  with  thanksgiving  and  prayer. 

Every  morning  when  I  leave  the  house,  I  take  with 
me  a  New  Testament,  and  till  now  it  has  never  happened 
that  I  have  brought  it  back  again.  Some  of  those  to 
whom  I  have  given  it,  carry  it  about  with  them  to  read 
with  their  friends,  and  on  each  verse  they  make  their 
reflections.  I  have  more  than  once  myself  seen  these 
little  religious  meetings ;  and  a  friend  of  mine  told  me 
that  he  was  present  in  a  tobacco-shop,  while  this  exercise 
was  held  about  a  chapter  in  the  Gospel,  and  one  of  those 
present  said,  "  Is  this  really  the  Word  of  Christ?  Then, 
why  do  they  prohibit  our  reading  it  ?  That  we  may  not 
know  their  errors  ?"  Another,  to  whom  I  gave  the  New 
Testament  some  time  ago,  told  me  yesterday,  that  he 
reads  a  chapter  every  day  with  his  family,  and  that  he 
thinks  this  is  the  true  mass,  to  which  we  should  listen 
every  day. 

The  Bible  also  begins  to  be  read  in  Rome  in  the  con- 
vents, in  the  monasteries,  in  families,  in  shops ;  and  I  hope 
also  to  see  it  read  in  the  streets.  I  have  promised  to  send 
many  copies  of  the  New  Testament  now  being  printed,  to 
the  Popular  Club  ("  Circolo  Popolare"),  and  am  certain 
that  many  wish  to  possess  it.  Meanwhile,  we  accompany 
this  work  of  God  with  our  suggestions  and  instructions. 
I  have  some  truly  zealous  companions,  who  lose  no  oppor-

iiit«i  tlie  iiou" -,  we  frequent  shops  (especially  tli 
and  wo  always  find  work  in  every  place.  The  means 
which  the  i»ruvitlence  of  God  has  employed  to  make  the 
Gospel  of  Chriit  loved  and  desired,  is  the  opposition  of  the 
priests  to  the  new  Government  of  the  Republic.  The 
n^asoninir  of  the  people  is  this  : — "  Neither  Jesus  Christ 
nor  his  Apostles  over  mixed  themselves  up  with  political 
affairs,  lie  who  has  said,  '  My  kingdom  is  not  of  this 
world/  *  Give  to  Gtesar  the  things  which  are  CfiBsar's,  and 
to  God  the  things  which  are  God's,'  did  not  wish  that  those 
who  are  ministers  of  religion  should  put  obstacles  in  the 
way  of  those  who  are  ministers  of  the  civil  Government, 
and,  least  of  all,  that  they  should  meddle  with  these 
things.  Now,  these  priests  of  ours  wish  to  be  meddling 
and  opposing  in  every  way ;  consequently,  they  are  not 
the  real  ministers  of  God."  From  this  first  reasoning 
they  draw  many  consequences.  "  By  their  previous  inter- 
ference in  the  State  they  have  abused  their  commission, 
and  employed  spiritual  means  for  an  entirely  worldly  end. 
Therefore  they  are  a  worldly  race,  in  the  mask  of  a  sacred 
dress.  But  a  worldly  class  canno.t  purely  administer 
heavenly  things ;  therefore,  they  are  likely,  from  earthly 
■-•— i^sts,  to  have  lied  in  the  things  of  God.  Let  us 
line  in  what  points  they  have  lied.  Let  us  search  the 
Word  of  God."  Hence  the  desire,  in  all  classes,  to 
stady  the  Bible. 

Oar  people  are  naturally  religious,  and  the  principle 
in  the  ascendant  is  Christianity.  That  word  has  a  very 
great  power  over  their  minds,  and  by  Christianity  they 
mean  the  doctrine  taught  by  Jesus  Christ  and  preached 
by  his  Apottlas.  As  often,  then,  as  one  shows  them  that 
some  article  of  their  belief  is  contrary  to  the  teachings  of 
Christ  and  of  his  Apostles, — if  this  is  proved  by  the  Bible, 
the  Divine  inspiration  of  which  they  admit,  they  are  ready 
to  correct  and  reform  themselves.    The  mistrust  in  which

they  now  hold  the  priests  renders  them  disposed  to  admit 
that  they  may  have  been  deceived  by  them  in  many 
things.  For  which  reason  it  is  now  easy  to  reach  their 
minds,  and  contradict  the  doctrines  invented  by  the  priests. 
Nevertheless,  it  is  necessary  to  do  so  with  some  caution ; 
and  it  is  a  good  rule  to  begin  some  religious  discourse 
with  a  reference  to  State  matters.  This  is  the  plan  we 
pursue.  I  have  contented  myself,  till  now,  with  speaking 
privately  in  the  way  of  personal  appeal ;  but  I  shall  soon 
take  the  opportunity  of  speaking  also  in  public  to  the 
people.  I  am  waiting  for  the  passing  of  the  statute  in 
which  there  will  be  the  very  important  article  of  religious 
liberty.  I  am  occupied  myself  for  this  object  with  some  of 
the  Deputies  of  the  Assembly,  who  are  my  friends,  to 
whom  I  have  communicated  my  ideas,  and  they  are  of 
the  same  mind  with  me.  When  the  law  is  established, 
I  shall  present  myself  to  the  public  with  the  Bible  in 
my  hand,  and  shall  say  that  which  the  Lord  will  teach  me. 
Then  the  newspaper  will  be  most  opportune,  and  also  the 
publishing  of  some  tracts  which  I  am  now  preparing. 

Oh,  how  grateful  I  am  to  those  good  brethren  who 
pray  for  us!  It  is  the  promise  of  Jesus  Christ,  "All 
things  whatsoever  ye  shall  ask  in  prayer,  believe  that  ye 
receive  them,  and  ye  shall  have  them."  Therefore,  we 
shall  certainly  obtain  that  for  which  we  ask.  Forward ! 
for  the  Lord  is  with  us.  I  feel  full  of  strength  in  conse- 
quence of  the  faith  which  the  Lord  gives  me. 

*  *  *  *  * 

The  kindest  salutations  to  our  friends.  Pray  often 
for  us.    May  the  Lord  be  with  us  I 

Adieu !   Your  brother,

Have  I  told  you  that  we  meet  twice  a-week,  Thursdays 
and  Sundays,  in  the  evenings,  to  read  and  meditate  upon 
the  Scriptures,  and  to  pray  ?

ftSLIQIOUS  raBlDOM— LETTER  IIL-CIRCOLO  POPOLARB.      10 

DR,  ACHILU  TO  SIR  CULUNG  EARDLEY. 

Roiu,  April  S,  1840. 

Mr  DiAR  Sir  Culling, 

I  take  advantage  of  a  disengaged  moment  of  this  day, 
to  write  you  another  letter.  I  am  every  day  occupied 
with  my  work  from  early  in  the  morning  till  late  in  the 
eyening ;  and  I  am  very  glad  thos  to  employ  every  hour  of 
the  day  for  the  great  work  which  the  Lord  has  confided 
to  me,  and  I  am  all  the  more  rejoiced,  because  I  see  the 
Word  of  God  received  with  docility  by  the  people,  the  Holy 
Scriptures  read  by  many,  and  a  spirit  of  religions  investi- 
gation arising  in  many  parts  in  the  midst  of  political 
agitation.  I  have  given  the  Bible  to  several  Deputies  of 
the  Assembly,  who  have  received  it  as  a  most  precious 
gill.  I  am  waiting  for  the  completion  of  the  printing  of 
the  New  Testament,  which  is  now  being  published  in 
Rome,  in  order  to  spread  it  about  among  all  classes. 
[Dr.  Achilli  then  states,  at  some  length,  that  at  a  meeting 
of  the  Circolo  Popolare — (the  Popular  Club,  instituted 
in  support  of  the  new  order  of  things) — three  evenings 
since,  the  association  recognised  by  a  resolution  the 
perpetual  headship  and  antliority  ^ver  itself,  of  our 
blessed  Lord.  This  expression  of  feeling  will  be  the 
better  understood,  when  it  is  remembered  that  it  is  usual 
in  Roman  Catholic  countries  to  place  associations,  cities, 
public  objects,  Ac.,  under  the  special  protection  of  the 
N  ir_'in  Mary  or  of  one  of  the  Saints.  The  present  Pope 
iit  this  manner  publicly  invoked  the  patronage  of  the 
Virgin  Mary  for  the  city  of  Rome,  during  the  late 
troubles.  The  act  of  the  Circolo  Popolare  has  an  impor- 
tant religious  as  well  as  anti-Papal  significance.  Ue  adds : — ] 
The  speeches  made  on  that  occasion  were  touching ;  every 
one  obsenred  that  religion  is,  so  to  speak,  the  soul  of 
ererything ;  that  we  must  be  true  Christians,  if  we  nv 
deserve  liberty ;  that,  liberty  being  a  gift  of  Qod,  11* 
not  give  it,  unless  we  ask  for  it  in  prayer,  and  through  the

intercession  of  Jesus  Christ.  But  to  be  good  Christians, 
observed  one  of  them,  we  must  lay  aside  errors  and 
superstitions.  We  have  been  sufficiently  degraded  by  the 
teaching  of  our  priests,  and  it  is  through  their  fault  that 
we  have  confused  things  Divine  and  human,  truth  and 
falsehood.  To  be  faithful  to  God  and  believers  in  His 
Christ,  we  must,  therefore,  purify  our  faith.  Some  one 
else  said,  that  true  Christianity  is  the  religion  of  free  men, 
and  that  which  has  till  now  rendered  us  slaves,  is  not 
Christianity  but  the  Papacy ;  that  the  Pope  has  wickedly 
called  himself  the  Vicar  of  Christ,  while  he  has  been  the 
first  to  transgress  the  precepts  of  the  Gospel;  that  we  must 
not  believe  the  priests,  when  they  teach  us  things  which 
are  not  found  in  the  Gospel  of  Christ.  And  they  concluded, 
in  short,  that  we  must  return  to  the  faith  of  our  forefathers, 
when  religion  was  pure,  and  Christian  life  was  holy. 
Imagine  how  much  I  enjoyed  these  observations,  and  how 
I  made  my  comments  and  additions  to  all  that  was  said. 

[Dr.  Achilli  then  describes  the  excitement  produced  in 
Rome,  by  the  prospect  of  hostilities,  and  he  gave  some 
particulars  on  the  course  which  the  Government  is  pur- 
suing. He  adds : — ]  In  this  war  I  shall  be  the  captain  of  a 
little  corps  which  will  fight  courageously  with  the  arms  of 
prayer,  and  our  corps  will  conquer  better  than  the  others 
who  will  fight  with  the  earthly  arms  ;  these  to  carry  death 
into  the  enemy's  camp, — we  to  bring  life  to  the  houses  of 
the  brethren.  It  is  on  our  combat  that  the  safety  of  the 
Republic  will  turn.  Meantime,  we  have  determined  that, 
besides  the  meeting  which  is  held  at  my  house  on  Sunday 
and  Thursday  evenings,  we  shall  go  into  our  friends' 
houses,  and  hold  family  prayer-meetings.  In  some  of  these 
families,  the  reading  of  the  Holy  Scriptures,  with  obser- 
vations, and  a  prayer  at  the  end,  has  already  been  begun, 
even  though  we  do  not  go  there.  Two  of  my  friends  have 
left  Rome,  and  have  gone  to  occupy  themselves  in  otlicr 
towns.     For  the  present,  I  shall  not  tell  you  their  names,

otlicrs  are  oociipicd  in  ihc  correction  of  the  New  Testament 
which  ia  going  through  the  presa ;  and  in  the  circulation 
of  the  Bible  and  of  some  of  those  tracts  published  at  Flo- 
rence, which  we  have.  I  have  begun  my  tracts.  I  send 
you  the  first,  which  has  little  in  it,  because  I  wish  to  make 
a  trial  with  this,  and  to  see  the  impression  it  makes  on  the 
public.  To-day,  I  have  sent  a  second  to  the  press,  which 
is  somewhat  more  full  and  copious ;  and  I  purpose  having  a 
series  of  addresses,  which  will  be  published  weekly,  on  the 
imtha  of  Christianity,  and  against  the  opposite  errors  of 
the  Papal  system.  I  will  send  you  them  as  they  come 
out.  That  which  is  now  being  printed,  is  aimed  against 
auricular  confession,  and  I  am  sure  it  will  excite  a  great 
commotion  amongst  the  priests,  but  it  will  do  much  good 
amongst  all  those  who  love  to  know  the  truth.  I  think  of 
publishing  a  little  book,  which  should  point  out  passages 
of  t?cripture  on  some  of  the  most  important  doctrines  of 
the  Gospel.  This  would  be  the  best  and  most  useful  of 
all  the  tracts,  because  it  would  make  men  study  the  Holy 
Scriptures,  and  find  therein  all  that  is  most  important  to 
be  known.  Since  the  Lord  has  opened  to  us  this  door, 
which  seemed  to  be  for  ever  shut,  wc  must  enter  full  of 
course,  and  endeavour  to  do  all  that  lie  would  have  us  do.  I 
hope  that  this  door  will  never  more  be  closed,  but  that  it  will 
even  open  more  freely.  However,  the  contrary  is  ])ossible : 
the  door  may  again  be  shut.  Time  must,  therefore,  not  be 
lost;  we  must  do  as  much  as  we  can,  that  the  adversary  of 
Chriat  may  not  again  find  things  as  he  left  them,  nor  that 
state  of  ignorance  of  which  he  has  hitherto  taken  advantage. 
People  (^ntinoally  say  to  me,  "  Uow  is  it  possible  that  we 
have  been  able  to  live  till  now  in  such  ignorance,  and  in  the 
belief  of  such  errors  t  No  one  shall  any  more  take  away 
from  us  the  faitli  that  the  Lord  senda  ns  by  means  of  His 
Word. "  We  must,  then,  take  away  this  ignorance,  and  that 
can  be  done  by  word  of  mouth,  and  especially  by  publication. 


22  IMPRISONMENT,  &lt;fcc.  OF  DR.  ACHLLLI. 

The  day  before  yesterday,  the  Palace  of  the  Inquisition 
was  opened  to  the  public.  People  crowded  to  see  that 
horrible  place,  where  so  many  good  Christians  have  been 
tormented,  under  the  pretext  of  being  heretics.  There 
were  then  seen  the  horrid  dungeons,  where  the  victims  of 
the  Papacy  have  been  incarcerated.  It  seems  that  the 
Inquisitors,  in  hopes  of  an  intervention  to  bring  back  the 
Pope  and  Cardinals  to  Rome,  did  not  take  sufficient  care 
to  remove  certain  objects  which  might  betray  their  cruelty 
to  the  people.  There  were  to  be  seen  in  the  lower  dun- 
geons, which  are  the  worst,  the  ragged  remains  of  the 
dresses,  not  only  of  men,  but  of  women  and  children.  On  the 
walls  are  to  be  read  expressions  of  grief,  written  with 
charcoal,  and  some  with  blood.  A  trap-door  was  to  be 
seen,  and  a  burial-place  with  human  bones.  But  a  sub- 
terranean cave  occasioned  especial  horror,  covered  with 
remains  of  bones  and  earth  mixed,  including  human  skulls 
and  skeletons  of  different  forms  and  sizes,  indicating  per- 
sons of  different  ages  and  sexes.  The  only  things  which 
have  not  been  found  (with  the  exception  of  some  things 
which  might  have  been  used  for  that  purpose)  are  the 
instruments  of  torture,  which  were  used  to  make  the 
guilty  confess.  It  seems  that  these  alone  they  have  been 
careful  enough  to  destroy,  if  indeed  they  may  not  be 
found  walled  up  in  some  corner.  And  for  this  end  the 
Government  have  determined  to  have  the  walls  broken 
into,  to  discover  what  they  may  have  hid  there.  All 
who  have  seen  those  remains  of  clothing  and  bones, 
feel  justly  indignant  at  the  inhumanity  of  those  as- 
sassins, who,  under  the  cloak  of  religious  zeal,  per- 
mitted every  kind  of  cruelty.  Would  that  those  who 
wish  to  excuse  that  hellish  tribunal,  and  who  do  not  believe 
what  others  say  to  be  truth,  would  come  and  see  with 
their  own  eyes.  I  wish  that  the  friends  and  defenders  of 
I'opery  in  England  would  come  and  touch  these  things 
with  their  own  hands,  and  then  tell  me  what  Papal  ministers

may  not  be  capable  of,  when  they  have  the  heart  to  per- 
petrate such  barbarities  I  The  Government  will  be  urged 
to  leave  this  place  tit  statu  quo  for  some  time,  so  that  oar 
friends  among  the  English  may  verify  with  their  own  eyes 
all  that  they  hear  said  concerning  this  "Palace  of  the 
Inquisition." 

I  am  certain  that  you  and  all  our  brethren  will  pray 
to  the  Lord  for  us.  I  read  your  letter  to  my  friends  here, 
in  which  you  tell  me  that  prayer  is  continually  oflfered  up 
for  us  in  many  places,  and  by  many  persons.  We  do 
indeed  feel  full  of  strength.  We  are  few,  but  we  feel,  to 
ourselvee,  as  if  we  were  many,  for  all  that  we  do  tends  to 
the  glory  of  God.  Do  not  be  weary  of  asking  help  for  our 
poor  strength,  and  the  Spirit  of  the  Lord  will  be  with  us. 
Believe  me,  with  particular  affection. 

Yours  very  truly,

DR.  ACHILLI  TO  L.  H.  J.  TONNA,  ESQ. 

Boxx,  May  7,  1849. 
Mt  dkar  Fribnd, 

Rome  is  between  two  armies.    At  the  south  are  the 

French,  in  number  about  8,000 ;  at  the  east,  the  Neapoli- 

tana,  t(^ther  with  Spaniards,  Portuguese,  Swiss,  &amp;c.,  in 

number  about  12,000.     On  the  30th  of  last  month,  the 

French  advanced  under  the  walls  of  Rome,  and  attacked 

the  back  of  the  Vatican.     For  seven  hours  together  did 

the  firing  continue  between  their  troops  and  ours.    The 

enemy  lost   more    than    1,5Q0   men,    including    killed, 

wounded,  and  prisoners,  and  we  hardly  250  in  all.    The 

French,  having  experienced  this  resistance,  did  not  make 

a  second  attempt,  and  have  retired  towards  Civita  Vecchia. 

Yesterday,  the  Neapolitans  advanced,  and  their  vanguard, 


24  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

of  about  1,000  men,  was  only  ten  miles  from  Rome.    A 
body  of  our  troops  went  to  meet  them,  and  routed  them. 
Yesterday  evening  there  entered  Rome  several  prisoners, 
with  two  cannons  and  many  carts  full  of  arms  and  bag- 
gage, which  had  remained  on  the  field  after  their  flight. 
To-day  there  is  nothing  new.     The  city  of  Rome  is  very 
well  fortified :  within  the  walls  it  is  full  of  barricades,  and 
though  its  siege  is  almost  impossible,  because  of  the  great 
extent  of  the  walls,  yet  it  has  been  thought  well  to  pro- 
vision it  for  a  long  time.     Our  soldiers,  what  between 
regular  troops  and  corps  of  volunteers,  consist  of  more 
than  30,000  men,  to  which  may  be  added  a  crowd  of 
people,  some  armed  with  guns,  others  with  pick-axes  and 
other  terrible  weapons.     The  enthusiasm  for  the  defence 
of  our  rights  is  at  the  highest  pitch.     All  the  cities  of  the 
State,  as  well  as  the  capital,  boil  over  against  any  inva- 
sion, and  are  protecting  and  arming  themselves.     But  our 
destiny  is  in  God's  hands.      It  is  in  Him  that  all  the  good 
confide.     If  He  wills  it,  we  shall  certainly  have  the  vic- 
tory.    In  this  state  of  affairs  I  continue  my  business  with 
the  same  calm  of  spirit.     In  the  midst  of  all  the  noise  of 
arms,  I  am  able  to  speak  of  God.     That  hatred  of  the 
political  Papacy  which  increases  every  day,  is  augmenting 
against  the  religious  Papacy.     The  churches  are  empty  of 
people ;  very  few  priests  any  longer  say  mass ;  the  con- 
fessionals are  used  for  making  the  barricades  ;  the  mon- 
asteries and  convents  are  being  deserted.     A  little  stipend 
is  assigned  to  the  priests,  while  their  revenues  are  taken 
by  the  Government.     In  the  midst  of  this  confusion,  I 
enter  everywhere  to  speak  of  Jesus  Christ  and  his  Gospel, 
and  my  soul  is  rejoiced  to  see  around  me  people  of  every 
class,  who  listen  to  me  with  interest.     I  go  my  rounds 
from  early  in  the  morning  till  late  at  night.     My  mis* 
81  on  is  not  so  much  in  the  houses  as  in  the  streets,  in  the 
shops,  and  in  the  clubs,  which  are  called  circoli.     I  have 
also  good  brethren  who  help  me,  and  among  them  there  is

a  prood  young  monk,  of  the  same  country  as  Antouiu 
i'oleario,  a  great  admirer  of  the  works  of  that  holy  man ; 
and  another  priest  and  two  sculptors,  and  a  pious  advo- 
cate, and  an  Englishman,  known  to  Sir  Culling  Eardley 

and  others.    There  was  also  a  good  Frenchman,  M. , 

who  superintended  the  printing  of  the  New  Testament ; 
but  he  left  us  for  France  the  day  before  yesterday.  Each 
of  these  does  his  part,  and,  after  having  taken  the  initiative 
in  the  instruction  of  any  person,  they  bring  him  to  me  to 
do  the  rest.  A  few  days  ago,  I  was  brought  into  a  quarter 
of  the  soldiers,  where  some  were  desirous  of  reading  the 
Qospcl  in  Italian,  and  I  gave  them  the  New  Testament. 

You  cannot  think  how  pleased  all  are  (except  the 
obstinate  friends  of  the  Pope)  to  see  this  holy  book  printed 
in  Rome  for  the  first  time.  They  appear  astonished  when 
I  show  it  them,  and  it  naturally  happens  that  every  one 

wishes  to  have  it  to  read.

writes  me  word  that  he  would  like  to  be 


joined  with  me,  and  that  he  wishes  to  come  near  mc.  I 
have  a  great  regard  for  him,  and  believe  him  to  be  rich 
in  the  spirit  of  the  Lord.  For  that  reason,  I  think  he 
should  go  alone  into  some  part  of  Italy,  where  there  is 
great  need  of  some  one  to  evangelise,  and  where,  as  yet, 
there  is  no  one.  Bologna,  which  is  the  second  city  of  our 
State,  would  be  the  place  adapted  for  him.  The  Society 
of  Geneva  has  established  a  missionary  in  Tuscany,  our 

brother ,  of .     I  should  be  very  glad  if  they 

could  arrange  in  London  to  send to  Bologna  and  to 

Romagna.  In  Rome  I  have  abundance  of  companions, 
who  will  work  with  me,  and,  if  I  have  sufiicient  means,  I 
will  myself  employ  some  one  exclusively  for  the  purpose 
of  going  round  the  surrounding  country  with  Bibles  and 
tracts.     One  of  those  that  I  should  oniploy  would  be  my 

Christiaa  brother . 

My  tract  on  confession,  entitled,  "The  Keys  of  St.

Peter,"  was  received  with  much  pleasure,  and  it  much 
helped  us  at  Easter,  when  all  are  accustomed  to  confess. 
I  have  not  been  able  to  print  the  other,  the  title  of  which 
is  the  *'  Chair  of  St.  Peter"  (that  is,  "the  primacy  of  the 
Bishop  of  Rome,  founded  on  the  universal  see  of  St. 
Peter"),  because  my  printer  begged  me  to  stop,  fearing 
a  speedy  return  of  the  Papal  Government.  However,  if 
the  Lord  gives  us  peace  again,  I  will  continue  my  pub- 
lications. I  received,  some  time  ago,  a  letter  from  the 
Rev.  David  Pitcairn,  of  Torquay,  who  informs  me  that 
there  prayer  had  been  offered  up  for  me  by  the  members 
of  the  Evangelical  Alliance.  I  should  wish  you  to  let  that 
gentleman  know  how  full  of  gratitude  I  am  for  this  true 
kindness,  and  I  exhort  him  in  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  to 
continue  to  me  this  favour.  Every  day  I  feel  more  and 
more  my  need  of  Divine  assistance  ;  and  to  the  prayers  of 
faith  I  am  indebted  for  what  little  I  have  hitherto  been 
enabled  to  do. 

Thank  dear  Mr.  Herschell  for  his  kindness  in  collect- 
ing the  offerings  of  Christian  brethren.  May  God,  who 
desires  the  establishment  of  His  kingdom  in  these  lands, 
protect  with  His  mercy  all  who  agree  in  it ! 

Salute  all  the  brethren  of  the  Evangelical  Alliance. 
Yours  most  truly,

Rome,  July  1,  1849. 

My  dear  Friend, 

You  will,  no  doubt,  have  been  wishing  for  letters  from 
me,  and  I  was  very  sorry  not  to  be  able  to  write  to  you ; 
but  for  a  whole  month  we  have  been  closely  besieged  by 
the  French  army,  through  which  the  post  could  not  pass — 
indeed,  it  was  often  intercepted  even  before  the  siege

letters  I  gave  you  comforting  accounts  of  the  kingdom  of 
God  in  this  city.*  Yesterday  evening  the  eiego  was 
ended,  and  the  bombardment  ceased.  The  bombardment 
has  lasted  more  than  twenty  consecutive  days  and 
nights,  and  caused  the  death  of  many  women  and 
children.  Our  Assembly  decreed  that,  on  account  of 
this,  the  defence  should  be  given  up,  and  the  besieging 
army  should  be  allowed  to  enter  the  town.  This  furious 
combat,  which  has  cost  so  much  blood  on  both  sides,  has 
indeed  been  a  time  of  great  tribulation;  and  all  this 
because  of  a  king-priest, — or,  rather,  in  order  to  sustain,  in 
this  unhappy  country,  the  kingdom  of  darkness,  since  the 
whole  question  is  now  reduced  to  that  of  the  reign  of 
Popery.  The  France  of  Voltaire,  by  making  herself  the 
supporter  of  the  Papacy,  has  already  shown  that  Infidelity 
and  Popery  are  closely  allied.  The  people  of  Rome,  who 
have  much  good  sense,  are  persuaded  that  it  is  not  the 
king,  but  the  priest,  that  is  the  cause  of  their  misfortunes ; 
and,  within  the  few  last  days,  nothing  has  been  spoken  of 
in  the  clubs,  but  the  necessity  of  being  separated  from  the 
Church  of  the  Popes,  and  of  proclaiming  as  the  Church 
of  the  people,  the  Christian  Church  of  the  earlier  ages. 
And  for  this  purpose  there  has  been  published,  by  the- 
Circolo  Popolare,  an  answer  to  the  Allocution  of  Pius  IX., 
where  these  principles  are  developed  with  tolerable  clear- 
ness. I  send  you  a  copy,  from  which  you  may  form  a 
good  article  for  Ecangelical  Christendom.f  You  may  say 
that  this  document,  which  has  been  spread  among  all 
classes  of  the  people,  has  been  received  with  acclamation.

28  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACIIILLI. 

You  see  what  progress  the  spirit  of  reform  is  making  in 
Rome,  and  what  good  is  to  be  expected  in  this  country. 
All  this  is  owing  to  the  reading  of  the  Bible.  JN^o  day 
passes  in  which  persons  do  not  come  to  my  house  to  ask 
for  the  New  Testament,  and  to  speak  on  religion.  Lately, 
while  the  shells  were  falling  in  every  part  of  the  city, 
several  persons  used  to  meet  in  my  house,  to  read  the 
Gospel  of  Jesus  Christ  and  to  pray.  Imagine  what  was 
my  gratification,  in  seeing  this  work  of  the  Spirit  of  the 
Lord !  And  if  it  pleases  God  that  we  regain  peace  and 
liberty,  my  congregation  will,  no  doubt,  become  tolerably 
numerous.  We  shall  then  ask  the  Government  for  a 
church  for  our  worship.  The  present  laws  favour  us. 
In  the  new  statute  there  was,  at  first,  an  article  in  favour 
of  Catholicism,  declaring  it  to  be  the  religion  of  the  State. 
I  wrote  against  it,  stating  many  reasons ;  and  in  our 
meeting  we  prayed  the  Lord  to  incline  the  Assembly  to 
cancel  it.  A  week  ago  it  was  cancelled,  and  in  its  place 
was  put  another  article,  which  guarantees  religious 
liberty,  both  as  to  liberty  of  thought,  of  expression,  and  of 
association.  Do  you  not  see  the  grace  and  mercy  of  God 
in  all  these  things  ?  It  appears  to  me  impossible  that  the 
reign  of  darkness  should  return,  while  so  many  rays  of 
light  have  shone  from  heaven  I  Whatever  law  France  and 
Austria  may  wish  to  impose  on  us,  even  though  they 
^change  the  name  of  the  Government,  I  do  not  believe  that 
priests  can  again  reign  in  this  country.  At  all  events, 
their  temporal  power  will  end  in  destroying  their  spiritual 
power.  Our  present  question  has  taken  an  entirely  reli- 
gious aspect,  and  the  spirit  of  the  people  is  tolerably 
decided  on  this  subject.  One  more  blow  from  the  priests, 
and  the  Papacy  will  fall  altogether.  With  regard  to 
political  affairs,  we  do  not  know  to-day  what  may  happen 
to-morrow.  France  wishes  to  overthrow  our  Republic; 
but  can  she  destroy  our  Republicans  ?  She  will  restore 
the  Papal  Government;  but  can  she  extinguish  the  hatred 


PRIR9T:*  CANNOT  RDL8  A8  BBfORE— NO  PERSONAL  PEAR.   90 

felt  against  the  Popo  and  the  priests  ?  And  if  she  cannot, 
we  shall  go  over  the  same  ground  again.  I  leave  all  in 
the  hands  of  God's  providence.  Our  arms  are  prayer, 
and  we  shall  certainly  pray  with  faith.  I  am  not  think- 
ing at  all  of  leaving  Rome ;  I  shall  stay  with  my  good 
brethren  in  the  faith  as  long  as  it  shall  please  God,  and  the 
more  readily,  because  I  have  not  in  the  least  mixed  myself  up 
in  political  affairs.  The  Government  was  willing  to  give 
me  a  situation,  but  I  refused  it.  Therefore,  any  persecution 
against  me  would  come  later  than  against  any  of  the 
others.  Finally,  if  that  did  happen,  I  should  put  in  prac- 
tice the  precept  of  the  Lord,  following  the  way  he  should 
point  out.  But,  I  repeat  it,  I  am  fuU  of  confidence  that 
it  will  not  happen.  I  can,  therefore,  continue  my  work. 
Our  brethren  in  England  will,  I  trust,  continue  to  pray 
for  me,  with  all  the  more  fervour  as  the  danger  in  which 
I  am  placed  becomes  greater.  I  told  you,  in  my  other 
letter,  that  I  should  be  very  glad  to  provide  a  colporteur 
for  Rome ;   and  amongst  many  who  appear  suitable,  I 

prefer,  for  various  reasons,  our  brother,  Signor . 

He  is  a  converted  man,  and  very  zealous  in  the  things  of 
God.  I  already  employ  him  about  many  things,  and 
support  him  myself;  but  you  know  that  I  am  too  short  of 
means  to  provide  for  others  as  well  as  myself.  More 
brethren  have  joined  our  Church,  and  some  of  them  with 
their  families.  I  have  not,  however,  seen  one  thing  I  had 
hoped  for — the  conversion  of  the  priests.  Some  have 
come  to  me,  but  without  sincerity.  Only  three  came  to 
our  meeting.  The  greatest  difficulty  is  the  mass,  which 
they  will  not  give  up,  and  with  me  that  is  the  first  subject 
of  reproof,  and  the  greatest  impiety.  It  appears  as 
though  the  new  Roman  Church  were  to  rise  in  a  manner 
different  from  others,  and,  above  all,  without  noise  and 
ostentation,  one  communicating  to  another  an  impulse  to 
abandon  the  Pope  and  to  follow  Jesus  Christ. 

P.S.  July  3. — At  six  this  afternoon,  the  French  army 


30  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

entered  the  other  part  of  the  city,  making  great  display  of 
their  cavalry  and  artillery.  The  streets  were  empty,  the 
windows  shut ;  but,  at  various  places,  were  groups  of 
people,  who  cried,  "  Long  live  the  Koman  Republic," 
"  Death  to  Pio  Nono,"  &amp;c. 

M.  Merle  d'Aubigne  has  sent  me  a  manuscript  of  his, 
which  is  an  address  to  the  Italians,  and  especially  to  the 
Romans,  urging  them  to  read  the  History  of  the  Reforma- 
tion. It  is  a  sort  of  dedication  of  that  work,  written  that 
all  the  world  may  know  the  truth  of  the  doctrine  of  Jesus 
Christ,  and  the  genuine  history  of  the  facts.  It  is  a  noble 
composition.  He  recommends  me  to  translate  and  pub- 
lish it  in  Rome,  making  many  copies  of  it,  and  distribut- 
ing it  gratis.  It  is  a  little  work  of  about  forty  pages. 
Directly  I  have  sufficient  funds  for  publishing  it,  I  will 

do  so. 

»  «  •  * 

I  close  this  letter  on  the  3rd  July,  because,  till  to-day, 
no  post  has  left.  The  French  entered  only  last  night,  be- 
cause, it  seems,  they  feared  some  treachery.  They  occupy 
the  part  of  Rome  called  Trastevere,  and  they  are  busy 
in  destroying  the  barricades,  and  other  works  of  fortifica- 
tion. The  Romans  look  on  and  smile.  While  they 
entered  on  one  side,  about  16,000  of  our  soldiers  went  out 
on  the  other,  headed  by  General  Garibaldi ;  and  to-day 
others  are  leaving  with  a  great  train  of  artillery.  It  ap- 
pears that  they  are  going  to  follow  the  Austrians,  having 
learnt  that  the  Hungarians  are  advancing  towards  Italy. 
Our  Government  is  still  in  its  place.  Rome  is  quiet,  but 
threatening.  A  certain  gravity  is  observable  among  all 
classes.  We  shall  see  how  it  will  end.  As  yet,  no  pro- 
clamation has  been  issued,  announcing  the  policy  of  the 
French.  It  is  said  that  there  are  two  Cardinals  with 
General  Oudinot,  but  that  they  fear  to  show  themselves  to 
the  Romans,  knowing  well  enough  how  they  are  hated. 
The  return  of  the  Pope  is  everywhere   thought  to  bo

DR.  ACHILLI  TO  SIR  CULLING  EARDLEY. 

Bomb,  July  12,  1849. 

Mr  DEAR  Sir  Culling, 

You  will  have  seen  what  I  wrote  a  few  days  ago  to 
Mr.  Tonna.  I  am  certain  that  you  will  have  heard  with 
much  pleasure  of  the  progress  of  the  Gospel  in  Rome,  and 
you  will  have  blessed  the  Lord  who  deals  towards  us  with 
such  mercy.  I — great  as  were  my  hopes — never  should 
have  believed  that  such  a  religious  awakening  would  have 
arisen  among  this  people,  and  that  the  Bible  would  have 
been  sought  for  so  eagerly.  I  will  tell  you  even  more. 
All  wish  for  the  London  edition,  not  because  it  is  a  better 
one  than  the  others,  but  because  they  know  that  it  is  the 
one  most  denounced  by  the  Popes.  I  have  only  one  copy 
left  for  my  own  use,  and  it  was  given  me  by  our  friend 
Mr.  Tonna.  I  have  twice  written  for  some  more  to  L^ 
horn,  and  I  am  very  sorry  when  persons  come  to  me  for 
them  and  I  have  none  to  give.  Beg  the  Bible  Society 
to  send  me  a  quantity,   and  I  will  deposit  them  with 

M.    ,    where    they    will  be    safe.      The  depot  of 

the  New  Testaments,  printed  in  Rome,  which  I  have 
been  distributing  all  this  time,  is  also  there.  The  Bible 
printed  in  London  produces  dnother  good  effect ;  it  creates 
a  feeling  in  favour  of  the  Reformation,  and  consequently 
produces  a  fraternal  feeling,  taking  away  the  evil  opinion 
the  Romish  priests  had  spread,  that  the  Protestants  be- 


32  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLT. 

]ieve  in  nothing.  Indeed,  since  they  have  seen  here  this 
London  Bible,  many  come  to  ask  me  what  is  the  faith  of 
English  Protestants,  and  they  conclude,  at  last,  that  the 
English  are  much  better  Christians  than  the  Italians ;  and 
they  wonder  that,  during  the  five  months  of  the  Republic, 
they  did  not  take  occasion  to  open  in  Rome  an  English 
church,  either  Episcopalian  or  Presbyterian.  What  a  pity 
that  here  there  are  no  persons  zealous  for  religious  things  ! 

A  little  work  that  I  sent  to  Mr.  Tonna,  "  Answer  to  the 
Allocution  of  Pius  IX.  at  Gaeta,"  has  produced  a  very  great 
ejffect  in  point  of  religion.  That  distinction  between  Church 
and  religion,  with  the  true  idea  of  the  people's  Church, 
of  the  invisible  universal  Church,  and  of  the  local  Churches, 
has  opened  men's  minds  in  such  a  way,  that  now,  all  being 
resolved  to  wage  war  against  Popery,  they  do  not  fear 
offending  religion.  Many  thousand  copies  of  that  work 
have  been  distributed  gratis  to  the  people,  and  all  praise  it. 

The  return  of  the  Pope  is  a  problem.  Though  the 
French  have  dissolved  the  Government,  and  sent  away  all 
the  employes,  the  name  of  Republic  has  not  been  abolished, 
and  the  steps  taken  till  now  indicate  that  the  French  wish 
to  govern  Rome  themselves.  They  consequently  prevent, 
or  at  least  retard,  the  return  of  the  priests.  The  number 
of  troops  introduced  is  greatly  augmented.  There  are 
said  to  be  in  Rome,  at  present,  more  than  40,000  soldiers, 
and  between  Rome  and  Civita  Vecchia,  about  30,000  more. 
All  this  indicates  something  very  different  from  the  restora- 
tion of  the  Pontifical  Government.  I  shall  take  advantage  of 
this  circumstance  not  to  move  from  my  post.  I  have  never 
mixed  myself  in  political  affairs,  much  less  shall  I  do  so 
now*  My  mission  is  too  innocent  to  cause  me  any  fear 
till  the  return  of  the  Pope.  In  that  case,  I  should 
be  obliged  to  leave ;    and,  if  it  pleases  God,  I  think  of

going  cither  into  Tuscany  or  Piedmont.  But  I  trust  in 
God  that  it  will  not  happen.  My  brethren  in  Home 
confirm  my  courage.  Every  day  we  unite  in  prayer  and  in 
reading  of  the  Word  of  God.  I  make  others  take  part  in 
prayer  besides  myself,  and  it  moves  my  very  soul  to 
Iicor  the  fervour  with  which  some  of  my  brethren  ask  God 
that  His  kingdom  may  be  established,  upon  the  ruins  of 
that  over  which,  till  now,  the  enemy  of  Christ  has  reigned. 
Oh,  how  cheering  is  this  new  Church  of  believers,  which  is 
now  rising  in  Rome  by  the  Spirit's  work  !  My  leaving 
would  not  grieve  me  so  much  now,  because  I  should  leave 
many  followers  of  Christ  and  lovers  of  His  Gospel,  and 
none  can  destroy  that  which  the  Lord  has  there  built  up. 
War  is  declared  against  the  enemy  by  brave  combatants, 
who  have  the  strength  of  God :  the  more  the  attacks  to 
which  the  enemy  is  exposed,  the  more  ground  will  he 
lose ;  and  if,  afterwards,  we  are  once  more  free,  we  have 
already  planned  to  open  a  public  church  for  Italian  wor- 
ship. The  late  Government  was  inclined  to  give  us  one, 
when  the  Catholic  persecution  should  have  ceased.  Now, 
all  are  persuaded  that  there  are  no  better  means  of  putting 
an  end  to  this  persecution  than  that  of  showing  ourselves 
unanimously  simple  Christians,  and  no  longer  Catholics 
in  the  Romish  sense;  and,  since  "  the  Bishop"  has  brought 
war  upon  us,  the  Romans  wish  to  try  how  they  could  get 
on  without  a  Bishop.  The  idea  of  Bishops  being  necessary 
to  ChriBtianity  is  decreasing  every  day,  and  hence  many 
are  heard  to  say,  "  Let  us  either  have  such  a  Bishop  as 
existed  in  the  primitive  ages,  or  it  is  better  to  be  without 
one.'*  I  think  I  see,  that  not  being  able  to  attain  the 
former,  they  will  adopt  the  latter  alternative.  •  • 
•  •  The  clergy,  for  the  most  part,  have 

shown  themselves  attached  to  the  Papacy,  in  every  way 
tenadoofl  of  their  former  practices,  and  supporters  of  false 
doctrines.  Nothing  has  more  disgusted  the  Romans  than 
seeing  the  priests  mixing  themselves  up  in  political  afiairs,

and  calling  themselves  Republicans,  while  yet  they  firml}^ 
liold  their  old  errors  and  habits.  Hence  the  idea  that  in 
a  new  Church  new  ministers  are  needed,  since  the  old  ones 
are  wanting  in  understanding  and  feeling. 

I  recognise  in  all  these  things  the  providence  of  God, 
who  would  entirely  purify  this  His  chosen  vineyard,  of 
which  He  Himself  is  the  husbandman,  and  Jesus  Christ 
the  vine,  according  to  His  parable.  His  will  be  done  !  I 
am  His  servant,  to  follow  all  He  wills,  and  in  the  way  He 
would  have  it  done.  I  am  certain  that  our  good  brethren 
of  England  and  of  Scotland  continually  offer  up  prayer  for 
us  ;  and  it  surely  is  on  this  account  that  we  receive  so 
many  mercies,  and  that  I  am  myself  so  strengthened. 
Beg  them  to  continue  giving  us  this  powerful  aid.  Re- 
member me  and  my  brethren  to  all  those  that  are  dearest 
to  us,  and  most  zealous  in  the  things  of  God. 

Believe  me  your  brother, 

G.  ACHILLI. 


It  is  impossible  to  read  the  foregoing  letters, 
without  being  struck  as  to  the  vast  importance  of 
the  work  in  which  our  brother  was  engaged,  the 
judgment  with  which  he  had  conducted  it,  and  the 
large  amount  of  success  with  which  God  had 
honoured  him.  These  letters  had  been  extensively 
circulated  in  manuscript  in  this  country,  and  where- 
ever  they  had  reached,  they  had  excited  a  profound 
interest.  It  may  easily  be  conceived  how  strong 
would  be  the  feeling  called  forth  by  any  danger 
which  threatened  the  writer.  But  the  last  of  them 
had  scarcely  reached  its  destination,  when  the  event

iUjuy..  Au-uHt  J,  1849. 

Sib, 

A  gentleman  well  known  to  you  by  name,  Dr.  G. 
Achilli,  member  of  the  Evangelical  Alliance  in  London. 
was  arrested  at  eleven  o'clock,  p.m.,  on  the  20th  nit.,  by 
three  men  dressed  in  plain  clothes,  and  not  presenting  any 
paper  of  authorisation,  but  who  intimated  that  they  came 
by  order  of  the  French  Prefect.  All  this  was  false ;  for 
this  arbitrary  act,  I  have  subsequently  discovered,  has 
been  a  mancenyre  of  the  Pope's  Vicar  and  his  associates. 
I  have  learned,  also,  that  the  unfortunate  man  is  already* 
thrown  into  a  secret  dungeon  of  the,  so  denominated, 
"  Holy  Office" — perhaps  doomed  to  the  horrid  tortures 
and  wretched  end  often  inflicted  in  that  abominable  and 
fiendly  establishment ! 

Mr.  Freeborn,  British  Consular  Agent  here  (who  in 
many  instances  has  acted,  in  the  late  unhappy  circumstances, 
with  a  most  laudable  spirit  of  humanity  towards  those 
who  have  needed  his  assistance  or  protection),  has  taken 
np  most  feelingly  this  momentous  case  also ;  but  if  he  be 
not  solidly  supported,  I  fear  much  for  his  success  in  saving 
the  virtuous  Dr.  Achilli,  whose  only  fault  has  been  that  of 
having  too  firmly  trosted  in  the  justice  of  the  cause  he  has 
embraced,  and  having  been  careless  of  the  perfidy  of  his 
opponents.  He  had  been  gifted  with  true  spiritual  light, 
and  he  generously  and  righteously  wished  to  share  that 
light  with  his  feUow  -  creatures,  and  especiaUy  with  his 
oppressed  countrymen. 

Pray,  8ir,  do  not  loee  a  moment  in  communicating 
this  melancholy  occtirrence  to  the  members  of  the  Evan- 
gelical Alliance,  and  in  interesting  all  those  who  at  all  can 

promote  out  Christian  friend's  liberation.

36'  IMPRISONMENT,  d:c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

Here  let  us  pause,  and  recollect  that  the  indi- 
vidual thus  arrested  was  not  a  political  firebrand, — 
not  a  person  guilty  of  any  criminal  offences — 
(though  such  were  afterwards  maliciously  invented 
against  him  by  his  enemies,  only  to  be  refuted  by 
his  friends), — not  a  Roman  Catholic  monk,  priest, 
or  even  layman,  but  one  who  had  been  for  seven 
years  an  avowed  Protestant ; — that  his  sole  offence 
was  preaching  the  Gospel  and  spreading  the  Scrip- 
tures under  the  de  facto  Republican  Government, 
which  made  these  acts  perfectly  legal ;  and  that  his 
seizure  was  perpetrated  during  the  administration 
of  the  Roman  Government  by  the  French  Com- 
mander-in-Chief,— the  French  Government  having 
professed,  that  they  occupied  Rome  in  order  to 
protect  its  population,  and  not  with  the  intention  of 
abetting  vindictive  or  reactionary  proceedings  ! 

It  may  well  be  supposed  that  such  intelligence 
was  received  with  no  ordinary  indignation  ;  and  at 
the  same  time  with  a  firm  persuasion  that  God 
would  vindicate  His  own  cause,  and  would  call  forth 
the  energies  of  His  servants,  of  all  parties  and  of  all 
countries,  as  of  one  man,  on  behalf  of  His  persecuted 
servant. 

I  happened  to  be  at  Folkestone  when  this 
letter  reached  me.  It  was  immediately  transmitted 
to    London;    when  the  Committee  for  the    Reli- 


DEPPTATION  TO  M.  DBOUTlf  DB  L'HUTB,  4&amp;  37 

gious  Iniptii\(  iiKiit  of  Italy  was  instantly  called 
together.  A  deputation  was  appointed  at  once  to 
wait  upon  the  French  Ambassador  in  England,  M . 
Drouyn  de  1*  Hujrs ;  a  deputation  from  the  Evan- 
gelical Alliance  also  waited  on  Lord  Palracrston. 
It  happened,  providentially,  that  a  few  hours  later 
on  the  day  when  the  letter  arrived,  a  friend  (as  I 
now  must  take  the  liberty  of  calling  him)  passed 
through  Folkestone,  on  his  way  to  Paris ;  and  with 
the  greatest  kindness  accepted  a  hasty  commission, 
though  I  had  been  till  then  a  perfect  stranger  to  him, 
to  convey  the  information  of  Dr.  Achilli's  arrest  to 
leading  members  of  the  Evangelical  Alliance  in  Paris, 
and  also  to  see  the  French  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs 
on  the  subject.  This  commission  was  so  promptly 
executed,  that  a  communication  was  immediately 
made,  in  tlie  name  of  the  Comite  Consultatif  of  the 
Evangelical  Churches  in  France,  by  Count  Agenorde 
Gasparm  (one  of  tlie  most  prominent  laymen  among 
the  French  Protestants,  and  formerly  their  advocate  in 
tlie  Chamber  of  Deputies)  to  M.  Odillon  Barrot,  then 
Prime  Minister  of  France ;  and  the  matter  was  also 
brought  personally  before  M.  de  Tocqueville,  then 
Foreign  Minister,  almost  as  soon  as  the  French  Am- 
bassador and  Lord  Palmerston  were  waited  upon  in 
London.

mittee  to  the  Government  of  the  French  Republic, 
was  put  into  the  hands  of  the  Ambassador  in 
London,  who  received  it  with  great  kindness.  It 
briefly  states  the  views  taken  of  the  case  by  Dr. 
Achilli's  friends,  as  soon  as  his  arrest  came  to  their 
knowledge : — 

TO   THE   HONOURABLE   THE    GOVERNMENT   OF   THE 
FRENCH   REPUBLIC. 

THE  RESPECTFUL  MEMORIAL  OF  THE  LONDON  COMMITTEE  FOR  THE 
RELIGIOUS  IMPROVEMENT  OF  ITALY  AND  THE  ITALIANS,  WHOSE 
NAMES  ARE  CONTAINED  IN  THE  ANNEXED  PROSPECTUS, 

Humbly  Sheweth, 

That  Dr.  Giacinto  Achilli,  who,  in  the  year  1844,  on  con- 
scientious conviction,  embraced  the  doctrines  of  the 
Eeformation,  as  held  by  the  Evangelical  Churches  of 
England,  France,  and  Geneva,  and  who  is  well  known 
and  highly  esteemed  by  British  Christians  of  various 
denominations,  did  proceed  to  Rome  in  the  month  of 
January  last,  under  the  auspices  of  the  said  London 
Committee,  not  to  take  part  in  the  political  agitations 
of  that  city,  but  to  occupy  himself  in  the  circulation 
of  the  Holy  Scriptures,  and  in  recommending  them  to 
his  countrymen. 

That  Dr.  Achilli  had  devoted  himself  quietly  to  these 
objects  during  the  existence  of  the  Roman  RepubHc, 
and  had  not  only  been  free  from  any  moral  or  politi- 
cal offence,  but,  lest  he  should  compromise  his 
position,  had  refused  to  accept  an  office  offered  to  him 
by  the  Republican  Government. 

That,  after  the  establishment  of  French  authority  in  Rome, 
Dr.  Achilli  remained  there  unmolested. 

That,  notwithstanding  his  quiet  deportment  and  the  real 


lUUTISlI  MKMnniAL  T«&gt;  TUB  PRRXCH  GOVRRNMEST.  39 

I-ropruty  ol  Uid  occupuUou,  on  softhe 

restored  Papal  power,  in  the  j^'-jr^'  m  i  tn  ,;  voming 
Cardinals,  haa  been  to  seize  on  the  person  of  Dr. 
Achilli,  and  to  oonfiae  him  in  the  secret  dungeons  of 
the  Inquisition. 

That,  on  tlie  night  of  the  29th  of  July,  three  persons 
entered  the  house  in  which  Dr.  Achilli  dwelt,  under 
the  false  pretence  that  they  acted  under  the  authority 
of  the  French  Prefect,  and  arrested  him  and  threw 
him  into  prison,  and  that  his  personal  friends  have 
since  had  no  communication  with  him. 

That  the  Committee,  who  feel  themselves  responsible  for 
the  safety  of  Dr.  Achilli,  wish  in  no  way  to  shield 
him  by  their  interference,  if  it  can  be  proved  that  he 
has  infringed  any  law ;  but  as  they  believe,  on  the 
contrary,  that  his  actions  have  been  strictly  legal, 
they  do  earnestly  entreat  the  prompt,  friendly,  and 
powerful  interference  of  the  French  Government  on 
behalf  of  the  injured  Dr.  Achilli,  to  establish  a  search- 
ing investigation ;  and  that,  if  he  is  not  charged  with 
any  legal  offence,  but  is  punished  merely  for  his 
religious  opinions,  he  may  be  liberated  forthwith,  and 
that  if  he  is  so  charged,  he  may  be  imprisoned  under 
the  manifest  protection  of  legal  authority,  and  be 
brought  to  a  fair  and  open  trial. 

The  Committee  desire  to  confide  the  case  of  a  really  unof- 
fending and  injured  man  to  the  honour,  liberality, 
and  humanity  of  the  Republican  Oovemment  of 
France,  who  will  not,  they  feel  confident,  sanction  a 
violation  of  the  fundamental  principles  of  civil  and 
religions  liberiy  in  Rome,  at  a  time  when  the  flag  of 
France  still  floated  on  the  Capitol,  and  under  the 
auomed  sanction  of  the  name,  however  falsely  used, 
of  the  French  Prefect,  but  that  they  will  at  onoo 
readily  be  alive  to  the  pressure,  and  meet  the  exi- 
gencies, of  the  case.

The  Committee  desire  to  present  the  assurance  of  their 
profound  respect  and  consideration.

In  the  meantime,  M.  de  Tocqueville,  Minister 
of  Foreign  Affairs,  took  up  the  subject  with  cordial 
interest,  and  M.  Odillon  Barrot  replied  to  M.  de 
Gasparin  in  a  letter,  from  which  the  following  is  an 
extract.  It  does  the  writer  so  great  honour,  that  it 
is  given  in  his  own  words,  with  a  translation  : —

CoMTE  Agenor  de  Gasparin. 

Paris,  25  Aout,  1849. 

Je  partage  votre  sentiment  sur  le  devoir  imperieux  qui 

incombe  k  la  France,  au  moins  tant  qu'eUe  occupera  Rome 

par  ses  armes,  de  ne  pas  permettre  de  persecution  reli-

[Translation.^ 

I  concur  in  your  opinion,  that  it  is  the  imperative 
duty  of  France,  as  long  at  least  as  she  shall  occupy  Rome 
with  her  arms,  not  to  permit  religious  persecution ;  and 
the  Council  is  sending  out  instructions  to  that  effect. 

While  these  proceedings  were  being  taken  in 
England  and  France,  the  removal  of  the  prisoner 
was  obtained  from  a  dungeon  in  the  Inquisition  to 
the  Castle  of  St.  Ahgelo;  owing,  it  is  believed,  to  a 
letter  addressed  by  the  British  Consul  in  Rome  to

Malta  to  Lord  Palmerston,  on  the  2utii  August, 
Ix'fore  there  had  been  time  for  any  suggestion  from 
England,  signed  by  the  Chaplain  to  the  Forces 
in  the  island,  the  Presbyterian  Minister,  the  Agent 
of  the  Bible  Society,  the  Treasurer  of  the  Malta 
College,  of  which  Dr.  Achilli  had  been  a  Professor, 
Dr.  de  Sanctis,*  till  lately  Cure  of  the  largest 
parish  in  the  city  of  Rome,  and  like  Dr.  Achilli 
a  convert  to  the  Protestant  faith,  and  several 
other  persons  of  weight.  It  stated  that  he  had 
been  some  time  a  resident  in  Malta,  and  Pro- 
fessor at  the  College  at  St.  Julian's  there;  that, 
having  left  Rome  in  1842,  and  having  from  con- 
viction renounced  the  doctrines  of  the  Roman 
Church,  he  remained  in  the  Ionian  Islands  and  in 
Malta  between  the  years  1842  and  1847,  supporting 
himself  by  literary  and  theological  pursuits ;  and 


*  Dr.  de  Sanctis  has  fblly  ▼indicated  his  brother  and  compatriot  in

that  he  was  known  and  respected  by  several  of 
the  memorialists,  and  by  others  who  feel  the  deepest 
interest  in  his  personal  welfare.  The  Memorial 
solicited  Lord  Palmerston's  interference  through  the 
Consular  Agent  at  Rome. 

The  steps  taken  by  the  French  Government  led 
to  the  attempt  at  justification  on  the  part  of  the 
Inquisition,  described  in  the  following  letter.  The 
statement  of  my  informant  (whose  name  is  not 
essential  to  the  narrative),  was  confirmed  by  M.  de 
Tocqueville,  at  the  interview  with  that  Minister, 
mentioned  in  page  52.  Dr.  Achilli  had  been  arrested 
on  the  29th  July,  and  now,  for  the  first  time,  his 
friends  learned  that  his  incarcerators  accused  him  of 
heinous  crimes, — an  accusation  which  turned  out  to 
be  neither  more  nor  less  than  a  barefaced  fabrica- 
tion : — 


Pakis,  Sept.  17,  1847. 
My  dear  Sir, 

I  am  very  sorry  to  have  to  communicate  information 
which  must  distress  you,  whether  it  ultimately  prove  to 
be  correct  or  otherwise. 

M.  de  Tocqueville  has  received  a  despatch  from  Rome, 
an  extract  from  which  he  has  kindly  allowed  me  to  see. 
It  states,  in  substance  : — 

1.  That  M.  Achilli,  previously  to  taking  orders,  was 
attached  to  a  young  lady  whose  friends  rejected  his  suit. 

2.  That  the  lady  retired  to  a  convent  of  Dominicans  at 
Viterbo. 


A0CU8ATI0N  Of  MURDBR.  43 

3.  That  M.  Achilli  also  went  to  tho  saino  town,  in  order 
to  become  a  Dominican. 

4.  That  an  intimacy  arose  between  them,  which  gave 
rL-ie  to  much  scandal,  and  caused  M.  Achilli  to  be  forbidden 
from  entering  the  monastery  of  the  Dominicans. 

5.  That  the  yomig  lady  died.  That  tho  tribunal  of  the 
Inquisition  immediately  commenced  a  process  against 
M.  Achilli,  who  fled  to  England  before  the  agents  could 
arrest  him. 

Of  course,  personally,  I  know  nothing  about  the  truth 
or  falsehood  of  these  statements  ;  but  I  know  and  have 
seen  enough  of  M.  de  Tocqueville  to  feel  justified  in 
expressing  to  you  my  conviction,  that  his  conduct  has 
been  guided  by  a  deep  and  sincere  desire  to  do  that 
which  is  right :  and  I  know  that  he  still  continues  his 
exertions. 

The  present  Government  of  France  took  oflSce  under 
very  difficult  circumstances.  It  is  anxious  to  possess  and 
to  deserve  the  good  opinion  of  our  countrymen,  and  it  is 
certainly  for  the  mutual  interest  of  the  two  countries,  that 
they  should  justly  appreciate  each  other.  I  am  sure  you 
will  agree  with  me  in  deprecating  any  public  expression 
of  anger  anUl  the  whole  of  the  facts  are  known.  Such  a 
course  will  certainly  be  most  for  the  advantage  of 
M.  Achilli.  .  .  .  •

On  the  receipt  of  this  intelligence,  the  Italian 
Society  lost  no  time  in  making  a  second  appli- 
cation to  the  French  Oovemment  The  following 
Memorial  was  agreed  to,  and  transmitted  through 
the  French  Ambassador: — 


44  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

TO  THE  HONOURABLE  THE  GOVERNMENT  OF  FRANCE. 

THE  RESPECTFUL  MEMORIAL  OF  THE  COMMITTEE  OF  THE  LONDON 
SOCIETY  FOR  THE  RELIGIOUS  IMPROVEMENT  OF  ITALY  AND  THE 
ITALIANS, 

Humbly  Sheweth, 

That,  since  the  former  Memorial  which  the  Committee 
laid  before  the  French  Government,  no  improvement 
has  taken  place  in  the  condition  of  Dr.  Giacinto 
Achilli,  who  remains  closely  confined  in  the  dungeon 
to  which  he  was  consigned  by  parties  professing  to 
act  under  the  orders  of  the  French  Prefect,  and  at  a 
time  anterior  to  the  open  assumption  of  the  Govern- 
ment by  the  delegated  Cardinals,  and,  therefore,  while 
Rome  was  still  under  the  military  rule  of  France. 

That  Dr.  Achilli's  friends  have  been  allowed  no  access  to 
him,  neither  has  he  been  allowed  to  communicate  with 
them  in  writing,  so  that  your  Memorialists  cannot 
even  be  certain  that  he  is  yet  alive. 

That  your  Memorialists  have  been  informed  that  the 
Papal  authorities  have  asserted  to  the  French  Govern- 
ment, that  it  is  not  on  account  of  his  Protestantism 
that  Dr.  Achilli  has  been  arrested,  but  in  consequence 
of  certain  other  charges  brought  against  him,  which 
charges  your  Memorialists  are  informed  are  as  fol- 
lows : — 
[Then  follow  the  heads  of  accusation  contained  in  the 
preceding  letter.] 

These,  your  Memorialists  believe,  are  the  grounds  assigned 
by  the  Roman  Government  for  the  imprisonment  of 
Dr.  Achilli,  and  they  at  once  appeal  to  the  upright- 
ness and  integrity  of  the  French  Government,  whether 
it  is  right  and  fitting — whether  it  consists  with  the 
honour  and  dignity  of  France,  that  a  man  should  be 
imprisoned  and  judged  on  charges  which,  instead  of 
condescending  minutely  to  dates,  names,  and  parti- 
culars, make  vague  assertions,  on  which  insinuations 


SBOONO  HIMORIAT.  TA  TFH!  FRKNCH  OOVKTINKBNT.  45 

are  made  to  rest,  and  from  their  very  form  preclude 
the  possibility  of  that  searching  investigation  which 
truth  and  justice  demand ; — the  witnesses  being  con- 
cealed, the  examinations  private,  and  the  advantage 
of  legal  advice — nay,  the  very  privilege  of  self-defence, 
in  any  form,  being  withheld  from  the  accused  person. 
Your  Memorialists  cannot  pretend  to  have  known  Dr. 
Achilli  in  all  the  various  positions  which  he  occupied 
previous  to  his  conversion  to  the  Protestant  faith, 
nor  can  they  affirm  his  blamelessness  anterior  to  that 
change ;  but  they  are  fully  capable  of  appreciating  any 
discrepancy  between  the  charges  brought  against  him 
and  the  known  public  facts  of  his  history,  accredited 
aa  they  are  to  them  by  sufficient  testimony. 
Your  Memorialists,  therefore,  direct  attention  to  the  fact, 
that  Dr.  Achilli  was  a  Priest  and  a  Dean  of  the  College 
of  the  Minerva  at  Rome,  and  a  Dominican  Friar,  in 
the  year  1823,  and,  therefore,  if  it  be  true  that,  pre- 
viously to  taking  orders,  he  was  attached  to  a  young 
lady  who  retired  to  a  Convent  at  Viterbo ;  and  if  it 
be  true  that  he  followed  her  to  that  place  in  order  to 
become  a  Dominican ;  it  is  at  all  events  a  truth  of  at 
least  twenty-six  years'  standing,  and  of  which  the 
authorities  took  no  notice  until  he  became  a  Protestant. 
Your  Memorialists  are  also  aware,  on  the  most  satisfactory 
evidence,  that  subsequently  to  this  date  Dr.  Achilli 
held  several  very  important  offices  in  the  Order  of  the 
Dominicans ;  that  he  held  high  offices  at  Viterbo  and 
Naples ;  that  he  was  appointed  Regent  of  the  Minerva 
College,  and  Vicar  and  Master  of  the  Sacred  Palace ; 
and  (to  which  your  Memorialists  would  call  particular 
attention)  Visitor  of  the  Convents  of  Romagna  and 
Lombardy,  by  which  appointment  it  was  committed 
to  him  to  visit,  regolate,  and  adjudicate  in  all  the 
Convents  from  Rome  to  Florence, — an  office  which 
would  not  have  been  committed  to  a  suspected  man. 


46  IMPRISONMENT,  dkc.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

Your  Memorialists  beg  also  to  state,  that  while  Prior  of  a 
Dominican  Convent  at  Naples,  he  became  suspected 
of  holding  doctrinal  views  esteemed  heterodox  by  the 
Church  of  Rome,  and  that,  in  consequence,  as  a  test  of 
orthodoxy,  he  was  required  to  preach  a  sermon 
panegyrical  of  the  Virgin  Mary,  and  in  which  he 
would  have  been  obliged  to  make  statements  which 
he  conscientiously  disbelieved ;  that  he  declined  to  do 
so,  and  was  actually  seized  by  the  Inquisition  on  this 
express  ground,  and  brought  to  Rome,  and  that,  having 
eflfected  his  escape  and  reached  Corfu,  he  immediately 
wrote,  published,  and  widely  circulated  a  letter  to  the 
late  Pope,  declarative  of  his  Protestant  sentiments.* 
[After  urging  the  case  at  some  length  on  the  French 
Government,  the  document  concludes  thus :] 

Your  Memorialists  trust  that  they  will  receive  from  the 
French  Government  such  a  reply  to  this  prayer  as 
will  set  at  rest  the  minds  of  Dr.  Achilli's  numerous 
friends — Englishmen,  Frenchmen,  and  Americans — 
who  deeply  deplore  his  present  melancholy  and  dan- 
gerous position. 

They  desire  to  repeat  the  assurances  of  their  profound 
respect  and  high  consideration. 

On  behalf  of  the  officers  and  committee,

*  This  letter,  with  two  others,  will  be  found  in  the  Appendix  to 
this  pamphlet. 

t  I  regret  the  necessity  of  troubling  the  reader  with  lengthy 
documents ;  but  this  being-  a  book  which  may  hereafter  be  used  in 
controversy,  I  om  constrained  to  do  so.    I  curtail  where  I  can. 


oOXFBUlfGI  07  lYANORLICAL  ALLlANCB  AT  GLABOOW.      47 

Branch  of  the  Evanj^clical  Alliance  took  place  at 
Glasgow.  A  resolution  had  l)cen  prepared,  during  the 
early  part  of  the  sittings,  expressive  of  the  sympathy 
of  British  Christians  with  Dr.  Achilli ;  of  indigna- 
tion at  the  conduct  of  the  Inquisition  in  bringing 
accusations  against  a  prisoner,  without  allowing  him 
to  communicate  with  his  friends,  or  to  be  heard  in  his 
defence ;  and  of  the  confidence  felt,  that  the  French 
Qovemment  would  see  that  justice  should  be  done. 

It  is  due  to  one  person  to  say,  that  the  adoption 
of  a  bolder  course  was  suggested  by  a  member 
of  the  Conference,  who  expressed  privately  to  several 
friends,  his  conviction  that  the  resolutions  pro- 
posed were  a  very  insufficient  fulfilment  of  the  duty 
which  the  Alliance  owed  to  one  of  its  suffering 
members.  His  opinion  was  communicated,  during 
two  days,  from  one  person  to  another,  and  apj)eared 
to  be  unanimously  approved.  As  the  result,  the 
following  resolutions  were  adopted,  on  Thursday, 
the  11th  October,  in  the  Conference: — 

"  That  the  Conference  have  heard,  with  sincere  satisfao* 
tion  and  approval,  of  the  prompt  measures  which  were 
adopted  in  relation  to  the  apprehension  and  imprisonment 
of  the  Rev.  Dr.  Achilli  by  the  Inquisition  at  Rome ;  and 
expreas  their  detestation  and  abhorrence  of  the  act  by 
which  10  flagrant  a  violation  of  religious  liberty  has  been 
committed  in  his  person;  and  they  enjoin  upon  the 
Council  to  pursue  with  vigour,  and  in  harmony  with  the 


48  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI, 

Italian  Committee,  whatever  measures  may  be  deemed 
proper  to  effect  his  liberation.  The  Conference  also 
record  their  unaffected  and  deep  sympathy  with  their 
Christian  brother,  who  is  called  to  endure  persecution, 
even  to  bonds  and  imprisonment,  for  the  name  of  Christ ; 
and  earnestly  recommend  to  all  the  members  of  the 
Organisation  to  remember  him  in  their  prayers,  that  he  may 
be  so  strengthened  by  the  grace  of  God  as  to  act,  in  his 
present  trying  circumstances,  as  becomes  a  confessor  of  the 
truth,  and  be  delivered  out  of  the  hands  of  his  persecutors. 
"  That  it  is  eminently  desirable,  in  the  estimation  of 
the  Conference,  that  a  deputation  should  be  appointed 
to  proceed  as  soon  as  possible  to  Paris,  to  communicate  with 
the  French  Government,  and,  if  necessary,  to  Rome,  on 
the  subject  of  Dr.  Achilli's  liberation ;  and  that  the  Council 
be  instructed  to  take  the  necessary  steps  to  send  one,  and 
to  procure  the  funds  necessary  by  a  special  subscription 
for  the  purpose." 

Subsequently,  a  committee  was  appointed  to 
nominate  the  members  of  the  deputation,  and  on 
their  report  it  was  resolved  :— 

"  That  the  following  brethren,  members  of  the  British 
Organisation,  be  invited  to  proceed  on  this  important 
mission ;  and  that  they  be  requested  to  avail  them- 
selves of  the  services  of  such  foreign  brethren,  connected 
with  foreign  Organisations,  as  they  may  find  expedient, 
viz. :— Sir  C.  E.  Eardley,  Bart. ;  lion,  and  Rev.  B.  W. 
Noel;  Charles  Cowan,  Esq.,  M.P. ;  Rev.  E.  Bickersteth; 
Rev.  Dr.  Steane;  and  the  Right  Hon.  and  Rev.  Lord 
Wriothesley  Russell." 

It  was  also  determined  that  information  should  "  be 
immediately  sent  to  the  several  Subdivisions,  of  the 
appointment  of  the  deputation,  with  the  earnest  request 


DEPtTATIOX  TO  PARI?  AND  nOMl— ARRIVAL  IN  PARIS.       49

while  travelling  by  sea  and  land,  vouchsafe  to  them  the 
grace  and  wisdom  requisite  to  conduct  their  important  mis- 
sion, and  sanction  it  with  Ilis  approbation  and  blessing." 


The  subject  was  also  mooted  at  a  large  public 
meeting  for  the  exposition  of  the  principles  of  the 
Alliance,  held  on  the  same  evening  in  the  City 
Hall,  the  Lord  Provost  of  Glasgow  in  the  chair. 
Four  thousand  persons  were  present.  The  proposal 
to  send  a  deputation  to  Paris  and  Rome  was 
received  with  acclamation;  and  a  subscription  to 
defray  the  expenses  was  commenced,  which  soon 
amounted  to  above  £100.  On  the  18th  October, 
Mr.  Baptist  Noel,  Dr.  Steane,  and  myself  reached 
Paris,  where  we  were  followed,  on  the  20th,  by 
Mr.  Cowan.  Lord  W.  Russell  and  Mr.  Bickersteth 
were  prevented,  by  unavoidable  circumstances,  from 
forming  part  of  the  Deputation. 

The  first  proceeding  of  the  Deputation  was 
to  intimate  our  arrival  to  the  British  Ambas- 
sador, and  to  ask  an  appointment,  which  we 
obtained  for  the  next  day,  the  20th  October.  In 
tlie  allemoon  of  the  19th,  we  met  the  Committee 
of  the  French  Section^  of  the  Evangelical  Alliance. 
There  were  present  members  of  the  Established, 
Lutlicrun,  and  Reformed  communions ;  Moravians,

\yesleyans,  and  members  of  the  New  Synod 
of  Evangelical  French  Churches,  composed  of  the 
old  Independents  and  recent  Seceders.  Among 
the  brethren  assembled,  whose  names  are  known 
in  England,  were  Messrs.  Adolphe  and  Frederic 
Monod,  Cuvier,  Vermeil,  Grand  Pierre,  Cooke, 
and  Field,  Meyrueis,  Coste,  Jahr,  Thierry,  &amp;c. 
The  object  of  the  mission  was  explained  to  the 
meeting,  and  the  co-operation  of  the  French  brethren 
invited  in  such  ways  as  they  might  judge  best.  It 
was  decided,  as  a  first  step,  that  MM.  Grand  Pierre 
and  Adolphe  Monod  should  accompany  the  Deputa- 
tion to  the  Due  de  Broglie,  if  an  appointment  could 
be  obtained  for  that  purpose.  The  duke  is  son-in-law 
of  the  celebrated  Madame  de  Stael,  and  is  one  of  the 
leaders  of  the  Conservative,  or,  as  its  opponents  call  it. 
Reactionary,  party.  A  Roman  Catholic  by  profession, 
he  is  yet  a  friend  of  liberty,  and  was  once  a  regular 
attendant  on  a  faithful  Protestant  ministry.  It  ap- 
peared highly  desirable,  in  a  question  between  liberty 
and  the  Papacy,  to  secure  first,  and  at  once,  the 
sympathy  of  a  statesman  connected  with  that  party 
in  France  on  which  Pio  Nono  thinks  he  can  lean. 

The  following  morning,  Saturday,  Octolxr  20, 
at  nine  o'clock,  the  Deputation  had  the  desired 
interview  with  M.  de  Broglie.  Ho  roccivcd  us 
with  the  greatest  courtesy,  stated  that  lie  believed

it  to  he  impossible  for  any  man  to  be  airested  under 
French  authority  for  his  religious  opinions;  and 
offered  to  procure  an  interview  witli  the  Minister  of 
Foreign  Affairs. 

At  noon,  the  same  day,  the  Deputation  kept 
their  appointment  at  the  Embassy.  We  were 
received  not  only  witli  great  personal  kindness,  but 
in  a  manner  which  showed  that  Lord  Normanby 
had  given  much  attention  already  to  the  subject? 
and  would  cordially  promote  the  cause,  if  it  could 
be  shown  to  be  one  where  religious  liberty  was 
involved,  in  so  far  as  it  could  be  done  extra  offi- 
cially. It  is  right  to  state  that  this  was  the  ground 
from  the  first  taken  by  Lord  Normanby,  and  from 
which  he  has  never  since  swerved.  As  the  repre- 
sentative of  a  friendly  power,  he  might  request  the 
Government  to  attend  to  an  appeal  where  their  own 
national  honour  appeared  to  be  at  stake ;  but  beyond 
this  he  could  not  go.  The  Deputation  learned  from 
his  lordship  the  state  of  the  question  between  France 
and  the  Pontifical  Government,  which  was  more 
fully  developed  by  M.  de  Tocqueville  two  days 
later.  Lord  Normanby  undertook  to  add  his  own 
application  to  M.  de  Tocqueville  to  afford  us  the 
desired  interview,  to  the  refpiest  already  made  by 
the  Due  de  Hroglie.

Noel,  Mr.  Cowan,  Dr.  Steane,  and  myself,  ac- 
companied by  Dr.  Grand  Pierre  and  M.  Adolphe 
Monod,  had  a  long  interview  with  M.  de 
Tocqueville  at  the  Foreign  Office.  We  presented 
a  "Memorial"  to  the  Minister,  with  a  document 
appended,  entitled,  "  My  Biography  and  Protest," 
drawn  up  by  Dr.  Achilli.  This  latter  document, 
dated  October  1st,  Dr.  Achilli  found  the  means  of 
transmitting  from  his  prison  to  England,  and  it 
reached  London  just  in  time  to  be  picked  up  by 
Mr.  Cowan  on  his  way  from  Edinburgh  to  Paris, 
where  it  was  delivered  to  the  Deputation  in  time  to 
be  translated  and  made  use  of.  This  is  one  of  many 
instances  in  which  the  proceedings  of  the  Deputation 
have  received  remarkable  Providential  assistance. 
The  two  papers  are  subjoined.  A  letter  from  Dr. 
Achilli,  which  accompanied  the  "  Biography  and 
Protest,"  is  also  added,  as  having  great  interest  for 
Dr.  Achilli's  friends,  though  it  was  not,  of  coUrse, 
put  before  the  Minister. 


MEMORIAL  PRESENTED  TO  THE  MINISTER  OF  FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS. 

Paris,  October  22,  1849. 
The  Institution,  the  British  Section  of  which  has  com- 
missioned the  undersigned  to  wait  upon  the  French 
Government,  consists  of  Christians  of  all  countries, 
and  of  nearly  all  Protestant  Churches,  liolding  the 
principal  truths  of  Christianity.     It  proposes  to  itself 


uimvnw  WITH  porbion  minister— mbmorial.       53 

as  its  object,  to  seek  the  anion  by  a  common  affection 
of  all  true  Christians  (without  regard  to  the  cora- 
monities  to  which  they  are  attached)  who  are  really 
poesesaed  of  the  common  faith.  It  also  proposes  to 
itself,  to  manifest  Christian  compassion,  and  to  render 
such  aid  as  it  is  able,  to  all  persecuted  and  oppressed 
brethren,  whether  members  or  not  of  the  Institution. 

The  British  Section  of  the  Evangelical  Alliance  held  its 
Annual  Conference  at  Glasgow,  in  Scotland,  on  the 
12th,  13th,  and  14th  of  this  present  month  (October). 
On  that  occasion,  animated  by  sympathy  with  an 
afflicted  brother,  it  appointed  a  Deputation  to  wait 
upon  the  French  Government,  on  behalf  of  Dr. 
Giacinto  Achilli,  a  member  of  the  Evangelical 
Alliance,  who  has  been  cast  into  the  prison  of  the 
Holy  Office,  in  Rome,  in  the  name  of  the  Prefect  of 
the  French  Police.  The  Deputation  is  also  charged, 
if  it  shall  think  fit,  to  prosecute  its  journey  to  Rome, 
in  company  with  members  of  the  French  section  of  the 
same  institution,  and  in  concert,  it  is  hoped,  with 
the  French  Government,  to  secure  the  liberation  of  a 
brother  whom  they  believe  to  be  innocent. 

The  undersigned  have,  since  their  arrival  in  Paris,  received 
the  annexed  protest  of  Dr.  Achilli,  which  they  under- 
stand has  been  communicated  to  the  French  authorities 
in  Rome.  They  believe  that  their  duty  will  be  best 
discharged  in  submitting  this  document  to  the  French 
Government,  as  a  personal  statement  by  the  accused 
of  the  facts  of  the  case.  They  desire  that  its  asser- 
tions may  be  investigated.  They  have  reason  to 
believe  that  their  friend  in  one  point  is  incorrect,  in 
supposing  himself  to  be  a  British  subject.  But  they 
believe  that  the  substance  of  this  protest  will  be 
found  accurate,  and  the  facts  there  stated  to  be 
incompatible  with  the  accusations  made  against  him. 

The  undersigned  arc  i&gt;erfectly  well  aware  that  the  tribunal 


54  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

of  the  Inquisition  has,  in  answer  to  the  French 
Government,  attributed  criminal  acts  to  Dr.  Achilli, 
apart  from  his  religious  faith.  Believing  these 
accusations  to  be  manifestly  and  on  the  surface  false, 
they  ask  for  his  liberation,  as  having  been  made  a 
prisoner  under  French  authority.  They  understand 
he  is  to  be  transferred  from  the  Castle  of  St.  Angelo 
to  the  prisons  of  the  Inquisition  immediately  after  the 
close  of  October,  to  be  tried  by  that  tribunal ;  after 
which,  on  the  withdrawal  of  the  French  troops  from 
Eome,  his  doom  may  be  regarded  as  certain. 

They  therefore  implore  the  French  Government  not  to 
leave  him  helpless  in  the  hands  of  his  ecclesiastical 
adversaries,  who  would  believe  his  death  (or  his 
perpetual  imprisonment,  if  not  death  itself)  to  be 
warranted  for  that  exercise  of  conscience  which  is  the 
recognised  right  of  every  Frenchman. 

They  feel  assured  that  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs, 
with  every  other  generous  mind  in  this  country,  will 
shrink  from  leaving  any  man,  arrested  under  French 
authority,  in  the  power  of  a  tribunal,  the  very  name 
of  which  is  odious  to  the  whole  of  Christendom. 

The  undersigned  present  to  M.  de  Tocqueville  the  assurance 
of  their  high  respect,  and  beg  to  subscribe  themselves

DR.  ACUILLrB  BIOGRAPHY  AND  PBOHBT.  50&gt; 

MY  BIOGRAPHY  AND  MY  PROTEST. 

[The  portion  of  this  document  which  relates  to  Dr.  Achilli's 
previous  history  appears  at  page  7.  After  bringing 
down  his  memoir  to  his  residence  in  liome  in  1849, 
he  goes  on  to  say :] 

No  one  has  ever  had  occasion  to  complain  of  me, 
and  I  have  a  sure  conviction  that  no  one  has  any  reason  to 
impute  to  me  any  failure  in  my  moral  conduct.  The 
ecclesiastical  tribunal  of  the  Vicar  of  Rome,  which  deals 
with  that  subject,  having  taken  cognisance  of  me  at  the 
beginningof  my  actual  imprisonment,  has  found  nothing  to 
say  against  mo  under  that  head ;  by  which  fact  I  am 
sufficiently  justified.  With  regard  to  my  political  life,  it 
is  known  to  all  that  I  have  never  interfered  in  the  aSalra 
of  any  Government,  becausewhen  the  Government  was  not 
according  to  my  wishes  I  changed  my  residence,  and  when 
it  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  my  views,  I  remained 
to  enjoy  the  protection  of  the  laws  for  my  liberty,  and  for 
my  religious  life. 

From  the  time  when  I  withdrew  from  the  ministry 
which  attached  me  to  the  Roman  Church,  I  believed  my- 
self bound  to  render  account  to  none  but  to  God.  Can  I 
have  been  deceived?  I  did  not  think  that  under  the 
military  government  of  France  the  Inquisition  could  have 
been  revived  in  Rome. 

I  was  quiet  in  my  house  when,  on  the  night  of  the  29th 
of  July,  I  was  arrested  in  the  name  of  the  Prefect  of  the 
French  Police,  and  the  next  morning  conducted  to  the 
prisons  of  the  Inquisition.  From  thence  I  was  carried 
to  the  priaon  of  the  Castle  of  St.  Angelo.  After  some 
days,  it  was  intimated  to  me  that  I  was  under  the  ju- 
risdiction of  the  tribunal  of  the  Inquisition,  for  religiout 
reason*. 

I  protest  against  the  ill^ality  of  my  arrest,  because  it 
was  without  cause,  and  under  another  name,  not  my  own. 


56  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

I  protest  against  the  illegality  of  my  detention,  because  it 
is  under  a  tribunal  composed  of  Cardinals  and  of  the  Pope, 
who  are  at  present  not  at  Kome.  I  protest  against  the 
irregularity  of  the  proceedings,  because  two  months  of 
strict  imprisonment  have  elapsed  without  my  ever  having 
been  examined ;  nor  has  the  true  reason  of  my  incarcera- 
tion been  declared.  And  I  wish  this  protest  to  stand 
good  with  the  Government  of  her  Britannic  Majesty,  whose 
subject  I  declare  myself  to  be,  so  that  they  should  notify 
the  same  to  the  Government  of  the  French  Republic,  by 
whom  I  have  been  arrested  and  consigned  to  the  Inquisi- 
tion. And  I  wish  this  protest  may  have  full  weight  with 
every  one,  because  I  protest  against  the  injured  rights  of 
liberty  in  matters  of  conscience  and  of  religion.  And  since 
it  is  the  police  of  the  French  Government  which  has  been 
the  means  of  my  imprisonment,  I  claim  to  be  judged  by  a 
French  tribunal,  since  I  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  Ponti- 
fical Government, — 1st,  because  I  am  no  longer  a  priest  of 
the  Roman  Church;  2nd,  because  I  am  domiciled  in 
England,  having  come  into  Rome  as  a  foreigner,*  with  an 
English  passport ;  3rd,  because,  during  the  time  of  my 
sojourn  here,  no  one  accuses  me  of  having  transgressed 
the  Roman  laws.

the  risk  of  breaking  the  narrative  of  the  proceedings 
with  the  Foreign  Minister. 

Thanks  be  to  God  the  Father,  and  to  Jesus  Christ  his 
Son  our  Saviour,  that  he  has  deigned  to  choose  me  to  bear 
testimony  to  His  holy  Gospel  1  And,  after  having  refreshed 
uiy  spirit  by  many  gracious  favours,  through  the  conver- 
sion of  many  brethren,  so  as  almost  to  have  overpowered 
{tnebriato)  my  soul  with  joy,  has  since  thought  fit  to  visit 
mo  with  my  present  tribulation,  which  is  indeed  of  little 
moment  when  viewed  by  the  side  of  what  so  many  men 
(illustrious  for  their  faith,  and  above  all,  our  Lord  Jesus 
Christ)  have  suffered  for  the  same  cause.  I  assure  you 
my  mind  is  not  cast  down  by  this  event,  which  is  now  the 
second  time  that  I  have  suffered  for  testimony  of  the  truth, 
to  which  I  have  been  impelled  by  the  Spirit  of  the  Lord, 
and  through  the  sacred  Word.  And  were  it  not  for  the 
thought  that  the  Gospel,  for  which  I  labour,  is  held  back 
by  my  imprisonment,  I  should  not  give  my  self  much  concern 
about  my  liberation.  But  as  my  imprisonment  has  served 
to  the  edification  of  the  brethren,  so  my  liberation  will  be 
for  their  great  strengthening,  inasmuch  as,  being  now 
greatly  distressed  at  my  imprisonment,  they  will  be  com- 
forted by  my  liberation,  and  they  will  bless  the  Lord,  who 
protects  His  real  Church  in  these  unhappy  countries,  where 
Satan  uses  all  his  efforts  to  uphold  the  kingdom  of  Anti- 
christ. These  dear  brethren  look  constantly  towards  you, 
in  the  hope  that  you  may  be  able  to  obtain  what  they 
cannot — my  liberation.  The  efforts  you  have  made  for 
this  end  are  already  known ;  but  since  they  have  not  been 
sufficient  to  attain  their  end,  so  they  have  desired  me  to 
beg  you,  in  their  name,  to  redouble  every  means,  whatever 
may  be  the  most  available  with  the  French  Government,  so 
that  I  may  be  placed  at  liberty  before  the  Pope  and  the 
Cardinals  return  to  Rome.     They  have  told  me  that  the 


53  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

Commissioner  of  the  Inquisition  has  given  the  strictest 
orders  that  I  should  see  no  one,  that  I  should  have  no 
communication  in  writing  with  any  one ;  and  they  have, 
besides,  recently  added  new  instructions  as  to  my  treat- 
ment in  prison,  so  as  to  make  it  more  painful.  Never- 
theless, they  have  found  the  means  for  me  to  write  these 
two  letters  to  you,  and  to  my  very  dear  Mr.  Tonna,  after 
which  I  shall  not  be  able  to  write  again,  unless  my  libera- 
tion should  be  obtained  during  the  month  of  October.  I 
am  now,  provisionally,  in  the  Castle  of  St.  Angelo,  under 
strict  custody,  until  the  prisons  of  the  Holy  Office  shall  be 
repaired ;  thither  I  shall  be  transported  in  the  coming 
month,  in  order  to  begin  my  trial,  for  which  the  Domini- 
cans of  the  Inquisition  are  already  preparing  the  charges 
(il  processo).  These  things  I  was  bound  to  tell  you,  at  the 
request  of  the  brethren  who  love  me  through  Jesus 
Christ  in  the  faith  that  we  mutually  profess ;  and  this  is 
the  faith  professed  by  you  also,  through  the  Word  of 
life  revealed  to  you.  Do  all  that  the  Lord  puts  into 
your  hearts  to  do,  for  the  love  of  the  brethren  in  Jesas 
Christ.  I  am  glad  to  have  been  able  to  send  you 
this  letter,  which  I  am  sure  will  gain  acceptance  with  you, 
knowing  the  love  you  bear  my  person,  and  the  anxiety 
you  have  to  forward  the  cause  that  I  plead.  Whilst  I 
spend  on  others  the  spiritual  treasures  that  do  not  perish, 
but  bear  fruit  to  life  eternal,  lay  aside  a  portion  of  your 
earthly  means  that  the  providence  of  God  has  granted  you, 
so  that  you  may  defeat  the  common  enemy,  and  so  tliat  the 
Gospel  of  Christ  may  not  in  this  manner  be  persecuted. 
I  also  exhort  you  to  raise  your  supplications  to  the  throne 
of  all  grace,  that  the  Father  of  all  mercy  may  be  favour- 
able to  us,  and  that  the  name  of  His  Son,  which  we  bear, 
may  be  glorified  on  this  earth.  Your  prayers  will  give  you 
wisdom  and  courage  to  free  me  from  tlie  hatred  and  the 
wicked  designs  that  the  sons  of  perdition  conceive  against 
me,  for  the  destruction  of  the  truth  and  of  that  liberty  of

spirit  which  Jeetis  Christ  has  brought  us  and  sealed  with  Ilis 
blood.  Kxclaim  against  their  tyranny  ;  act  so  that  the 
name  of  the  Inquisition  may  be  execrated,  and  so  that  this 
unworthy  tribunal  may  never  be  re-established  in  Rome. 
If  the  emancipation  of  the  Blacks  has  so  much  interested 
your  nation  for  the  rights  of  humanity,  will  it  not  oppose 
the  slavery  {tratto)  of  Christians  ?  There,  bodies, — here, 
souls  are  tormented.  I  would,  indeed,  be  willing  to  be 
the  last  victim  of  the  Inquisition,  if  I  knew  that  my  blood 
would  cry  aloud  before  men,  as  that  of  so  many 
Christians  has  already  before  God.  If  my  incarceration 
made,  public  to  the  world  would  excite  such  an  indignation 
as  would  shut  up  for  ever  this  abominable  Inquisition,  I 
should  be  fortunate  to  have  done  so  great  a  service  to  the 
cause  of  religion.  My  good  brethren,  you  can  do  much 
to  obtain  tliis  end.  Let  it  be  spoken  of  in  every  society ; 
let  all  the  newspapers  mention  it.  France  will  blush 
to  protect  it,  and  the  priests  will  repent  having  re- 
opened it. 

Pray  for  our  Roman  Church,  which  continues  to  in- 
crease daily  from  new  brethren,  notwithstanding  the  rigour 
of  the  Inquisition.  The  good  seed  springs  up  in  the  midst 
of  the  thorns  of  persecution.  If  some  kind  hand  removes 
the  thorns,  we  shall  see  it  grow  even  unto  the  harvest.  Pray 
that  the  Lord  may  send  His  Spirit  upon  these  young  con- 
verts. And  may  lie  grant  you  llis  grace  to  preserve  you 
in  the  vocation  to  which  you  have  been  called. 

Your  brother,  in  prison  for  Jesus  Christ,

It  may  be  supposed  that  the  desire  of  the  Depu- 
tation to  influence  M.  de  Tocqueville  favouralily 
was  not  the  less  earnest,  after  the  receipt  of  such  a 
letter  as  tliis  from  their  imprisoned  friend.     The 


60  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

conversation  with  the  Foreign  Minister  lasted 
nearly  an  hour,  conducted  on  his  part  with  the 
greatest  courtesy,  but,  at  the  same  time,  with  a 
becoming  determination  not  to  commit  his  Govern- 
ment improperly ;  not  to  interfere  with  the  due 
administration  of  justice,  supposing  Dr.  Achilli 
should  prove  to  have  been  a  criminal ;  and  not  to 
violate  the  rights  of  the  Pontifical  Government,  as 
re-established  and  recognised  by  France.  He  stated, 
with  great  modesty,  and  yet  dignity,  that  he  believed 
no  public  man  had  given  stronger  pledges  to  Europe 
of  his  attachment  to  religious  freedom,  and  he  read 
portions  of  a  despatch  lying  before  him,  addressed 
by  himself,  in  August,  to  M.  de  Rayneval,  at  that 
time  charged  with  the  French  diplomacy  at  Naples 
and  Rome,  in  which  he  declared  that  the  French 
Government  would  not  sanction  any  religious 
intolerance. 

M.  de  Tocqueville  stated  to  the  Deputation  the 
accusations  of  seduction  and  murder  officially  made 
by  the  Inquisition,  exactly  as  these  had  been 
already  communicated  to  Dr.  Achilli's  friends. 
He  added,  that  as  many  as  three  communications 
had  gone  to  Rome  and  back  on  the  subject,  the 
rejoinder,  in  every  case,  repeating  the  accusation, 
but  with  so  much  vagueness  of  detail  that  he  had 
at  last  written  for  a  categorical  and  precise  reply. 


COJTOUCT  OP  M.  DR  TOCQCBVILLB.  61 

He  recommended  the  Deputation  not  proceeding  to 
Italy  till  he  had  received  these  expected  despatches, 
and  promised  to  send  to  Rome  that  same  evening 
the  information  then  communicated  to  him. 

The  Deputation  retired  from  the  interview  with 
the  conviction  that  they  had  to  deal  with  a  man  of 
honour,  and  with  one  who  was  fully  alive  to  the 
gravity  of  the  case,  and  to  his  duty  as  a  man  and  a 
statesman  in  regard  to  it.  On  returning  home, 
they  immediately  wrote  a  letter  to  M.  de  Tocque- 
ville,  and  another  to  Mr.  Freeborn,  British  Consular 
Agent  at  Rome.  The  extract  from  the  latter  will 
show  the  anxiety  of  Dr.  Achilli's  friends  to  sift  his 
character  to  the  uttermost. 

SIR  CULUNG  EARDLEY  TO  M.  DE  TOCQUEVILLE. 
Fabis,  Hotel  Bristol,  October  22, 1849. 

Sir, 

The  interview  which  you  have  done  me  and  my  friends 
the  honour  to  give  us  this  morning,  has  convinced  ns  that 
you  are  resolved  to  do  everything  that  you  deem  just  and 
practicable,  to  save  Dr.  Achilli  from  a  cruel  fate  at  the 
hands  of  the  Inquisition.  We  beg  you  to  accept  the 
assurance  of  our  gratitude  and  of  our  entire  confidence. 

As  you  were  good  enough  to  signify  your  intention  of 
writing  to  Rome  to-day,  may  we  beg  you  to  have  present 
to  your  mind, — 

Ist,  The  extreme  improbability  of  the  accusations, 
directed  against  a  man  whom  the  Roman  Church  has 
loaded  with  ecclesiastical  honours,  subsequently  to  the 
period  at  which  he  is  stated  to  have  been  guilty  of  im- 
morality and  murder. 


62  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

2nd,  The  necessity  of  ascertaining  whether,  as  we  are 
assured,  he  was  arrested  before  the  official  restoration  of 
the  Pontifical  authority  ;  and  also,  if  not  by  the  orders,  at 
least  under  the  name,  of  the  French  Prefet  de  Police. 
We  are  even  told  that  he  was  seized  under  a  false  name, 
and  therefore  illegally. 

We  take  leave  to  add  a  request,  which  we  address  to 
your  feelings  of  humanity,  that  you  would  give  orders 
that  the  prisoner  should  not  be  retransferred  from  the 
Castle  of  St.  Angelo  to  the  prisons  of  the  Inquisition. 
Such  a  step  would  destroy  our  last  hope,  by  taking  him 
again  from  under  the  protection  of  the  French  authorities. 
Notwithstanding  the  inconvenience  to  ourselves  of  re- 
maining long  in  Paris,  we  are  quite  disposed  to  follow 
your  judicious  suggestion,  and  to  wait  for  the  arrival  of  the 
answer  you  expect  shortly  from  Eome,  before  deciding 
upon  some  of  us  proceeding  thither.  In  any  case,  we  will 
not  go  without  informing  you.  And  we  hope,  if  that 
journey  becomes  necessary,  you  wiU  be  good  enough  to 
procure  us  the  means  of  seeing  the  unhappy  prisoner,  our 
chief  object,  in  such  a  case,  being  to  ascertain  the  truth  of 
the  charges  which  have  been  made  against  him. 

I  have  the  honour  to  be,  Sir,  on  behalf  of  the  Deputa- 
tion of  the  Evangelical  Alliance, 

Your  faithful  and  obliged  servant,

Paris,  Hotel  Bristol,  Place  Vendome, 
October  22,  1849. 

My  dear  Sir, 

After  what  Sir  Culling  Eardley  has  written  on  the 
other  side,  I  shall,  without  further  introduction,  at  once 


LNQUIBllS  AT  BOMB— TUB  FRBNCH  BRBTHRBN.  68 

proceed  to  state  the  pointfl  respecting  which  wo  wish  for 

ACConUe  information. 

•  •  •  •  • 

We  find  from  M.  do  Tocquevillc,  that  besides  the  charge 
all^ped  against  Dr.  Achilli,  imputations  are  cast  tipon  his 
character  generally.  lie  is  said  to  be  a  man  held  in  little 
eatiination  (peu  consider^),  and  representations  to  this 
ellbei  M.  de  Tocqueville  states  come  to  him  from , 


,  and .    We  shall  be  glad  to  know  what 

foundation  there  is  for  such  statements,  and  from  what 
quarter  they  are  likely  to  have  been  communicated  to  the 
parties  mentioned. 

Perhaps  it  is  mmeceasary  for  me  to  suggest  how 
important  it  is  that  everything  should  be  ascertained 
immediately,  and  before  the  priests  or  any  adverse  parties 
shall  have  time  to  tamper  with  witnesses,  or  otherwise  to 
circumvent  ns  in  obtaining  the  ends  of  justice. 

I  remain,  &amp;c.,

The  8amc  evening,  the  Deputation  met  at  the 
house  of  M.  Adolphe  Monod  a  large  assemblage  of 
French  brethren,  including,  besides  those  previously 
mentioned,  the  Rev.  Messrs.  Vemy,  Meyer,  and 
Vallette,  of  the  Confession  of  Augsburg,  and  others  ; 
and,  in  particular,  M.  Frederic  Cuvier,  Canseiller 
tTEtaty  and  Ancien  Chefde  la  Section  des  Cultes  non 
CathoUqym  au  Minuthre  det  Cultes,  From  this  last 
gentleman  the  British  brethren  derived  much  valuable 
information  on  some  legal  points  of  the  question, 
which  his  former  official  position  qualified  him  to  give. 


64  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI, 

On  Tuesday,  the  23rd,  a  paper  was  prepared, 
entitled,  "  Memorandum  submitted  through  the 
British  Ambassador  to  the  French  Government." 
This  paper,  which  it  is  not  necessary  to  insert  at 
length,  shows,  from  a  comparison  of  dates,  that  Dr. 
Achilli  was  arrested  before  the  Commission  of  Car- 
dinals arrived  in  Rome,  and,  consequently,  while  the 
supreme  power  was  in  the  hands  of  General  Oudinot ; 
that  the  charge,  now  alleged,  of  immorality 
and  murder  at  Viterbo,  was  an  after-thought,  and 
not  the  original  ground  of  his  arrest,  but  that  he 
was,  in  fact,  apprehended  on  religious  grounds  ;  and 
on  either  or  both  of  these  grounds,  it  argues  that 
the  French  Government  ought  to  demand  his  liber- 
ation. If  he  be  not  liberated,  it  shows  that  he 
ought  to  have  an  open  trial,  and  not  be  arraigned 
before  the  irresponsible  tribunal  of  the  Inquisition  ; 
and  that,  in  this  case,  the  Deputation,  on  proceeding 
to  Rome,  ought  to  be  allowed  free  access  to  him.  It 
also  pleads,  that,  in  any  case,  the  French  Govern- 
ment should  immediately  prevent  his  being  trans- 
ferred to  the  prison  of  the  Inquisition.  It  con- 
cludes with  four  definite  questions  founded  on  the 
above  statements : — First,  Will  the  Government 
detain  Dr.  Achilli  in  the  Castle  of  St.  Angelo,  till 
further  orders  ?  Second,  Will  they  enable  liis  friends 
and  legal  advisers  to  have  access  to  him  ?  Third,  Will 


MIMOIUXDUU  TO  TITR  TRRXCTI  OOVRRXMENT— RKSP0X8B.    65 

they  liberate  liim,  it  he  was  arrested  for  religious 
opinions  ?  Lastly,  Will  they  lil&gt;erate  him  if  he  was 
arrested  in  the  name  of  the  French  authorities,  falsely 
used  for  the  purpose,  or  otherwise  under  false  pre- 
texts? 

This  memorandum  was  left  at  the  Embassy  in 
the  evening,  and  on  the  following  morning  (the 
24th),  the  Deputation  saw  Lord  Normanby  upon  it 
by  appointment.  His  lordship  expressed  his  opinion 
that  the  Government  would  not  commit  themselves 
on  the  two  last  questions,  which  might  be  con- 
sidered as  contingent;  but  that,  on  the  two  first,  it  was 
not  probable,  as  it  would  not  be  reasonable,  that  any 
objection  should  be  made.  In  effect,  on  Friday, 
the  26th,  M.  de  Tocqueville  informed  Lord  Nor- 
manby that  he  should  send  orders  that  night  to 
Rome  to  the  French  authorities,  to  press  on  the 
Roman  Government  that  Dr.  Achilli  should  not  be 
removed  back  to  the  Inquisition  from  the  Castle  of 
St,  Angelo.  Two  or  three  days  later,  General 
Rulhieres,  Minister  of  War,  infonned  the  Depu- 
tation that  he  liad  sent  positive  orders  to  the 
military  commander  in  Rome,  (not  to  press  the 
detention,  but)  to  prevent  the  removal. 

On  the  same  day.  Lord  Normanby,  in  giving  the 
Deputation  the  above  information,  conveyed  to  them 
the  opinion  of  the  French  Government,  that  they 


66  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

would  do  better  to  refrain  from  proceeding  to  Rome. 
It  was  felt  possible,  that  such  a  step  on  the  part  of 
emissaries  of  a  Protestant  Society  might  give 
umbrage  to  the  Pontifical  authorities,  and  impede 
the  object  in  view.  The  Deputation  took  time  to 
consider ;  and  the  same  evening  expressed  to  Lord 
Normanby  their  readiness  to  defer,  at  all  events 
for  the  present,  to  the  advice  of  the  Government. 
This  conclusion  they  communicated  the  next  day, 
Saturday  (27th),  to  the  Foreign  Minister.  Their 
letter  and  M.  de  Tocqueville's  reply  are  subjoined  : — 

SIR  CULLING  EARDLEY  TO  M.  DE  TOCQUEVILLE. 

HoTBii  Bristol,  October  27, 1849. 
Sir, 

Lord  Normanby  has  commumcated  to  my  companions 
in  the  Deputation  and  myself,  the  substance  of  his  conver- 
sation with  you  yesterday.  We  are  happy  to  hear  that 
you  were  so  good  as  to  say,  that  you  would,  by  last  night's 
courier,  instruct  the  French  authorities  in  Rome  to  press 
very  strongly  on  the  Roman  Government  the  detention  of 
Dr.  Achilli  in  the  Castle  of  St.  Angelo,  instead  of  his  being 
transferred  to  the  Holy  Office. 

Lord  Normanby  has  also  informed  us  of  your  wish 
that  we  should  delay  for  a  few  days  our  departure  for 
Rome. 

The  delay,  as  we  stated  in  our  letter  of  the  22nd,  is 
inconvenient  to  us.  On  Monday  next,  the  day  when  we 
contemplated  the  departure  of  some  of  our  number,  a 
week  will  have  elapsed  since  you  first  expressed  the  same 
wish  to  us.  We  do  not  apprehend  the  inconveniences 
which  you  think  might  result  from  our  visit :  our  simple 


CORRISrOXDEXCB  WITH  M.  D8  TOOQUBYILLR.  07 

object  being  to  ascertain  truth ;  and  this  on  behalf  of  a  man 
aocnsed  of  a  capital  crime.  We  do  not  think  that  even 
the  Pontifical  Government  could  take  umbrage  at  our  visit. 
On  the  other  hand,  we  do  dread  Dr.  Achilli's  transfer  to 
the  prieete,  or  the  removal  of  the  French  troops,  before  we 
reach  Borne.  We  know  what  ecclesiastical  vengeance 
maybe. 

Still,  Sir,  we  feel  it  to  be  our  duty  to  submit,  at  your 
request,  to  the  further  delay.  By  going  to  Rome,  we  are 
morally  certain  that  we  could  establish  to  the  satisfaction 
of  your  authorities  there,  that  the  accusation  of  murder, 
at  Viterbo,  is  utterly  without  foundation ;  and  this  must 
result  in  Dr.  Achilli's  liberation.  You  will,  therefore, 
feel,  Sir,  that  in  delaying  our  journey,  we  give  Dr.  Achilli 
an  additional  claim  upon  the  French  Government.  W^e 
entrust  him  to  the  honour  of  France,  in  the  confidence 
that  you  will  not  let  him  8u6fer  by  our  doing  so. 

We  shall  be  much  obliged  by  your  informing  us,  in 
the  course  of  Monday,  on  what  day  you  expect  your 
despatch  from  Rome,  that,  having  delayed  going  at  your 
request,  we  may  be  prepared  for  our  departure  for  Rome 
after  its  arrival,  in  case  of  necessity. 

I  have  the  honour  to  be,  Sir, 

Your  obedient  servant,

M.  DE  TOOQUEVILLE  TO  SIR  CULLII^O  EARDLEY. 

Paris,  October  28,  1848. 

Sia, 

As  I  have  already  had  the  honour  of  telling  Lord 
Normanby,  I  have  written  to  Borne  to  ask  that  Dr.  Achilli 

i2 


68  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

should  be  kept  in  the  Castle  of  St.  Angelo  until  further 
orders.  By  the  same  courier,  I  have  enjoined  anew  upon 
our  agents  to  collect,  and  to  transmit,  all  the  positive 
information  which  could  put  us  in  a  situation  to  judge, 
whether  Dr.  Achilli  is  prosecuted  for  an  ordinary  crime. 

I  have  told  you  that,  for  the  present,  your  journey  to 
Rome  does  not  appear  to  me  necessary.  But  I  see  no  great 
inconvenience  in  your  undertaking  it  (you,  or  some  of 
those  who  called  on  me  with  you),  if  it  appears  of  any  use  to 
you.  I  persist  in  thinking  that  this  business,  treated  with- 
out iclat  between  the  Pontifical  Government  and  ourselves, 
has  greater  chance  of  a  successful  issue,  than  if  anything 
happened  to  excite  public  opinion  on  the  subject.  But, 
I  repeat  it,  this  is  a  way  of  looking  at  it  in  which  you 
may  not  participate.  Let  me  add,  that  if  you  determine 
on  going  to  Rome,  I  am  ready  to  give  you  letters  of 
introduction  to  the  General  in  Chief,  and  to  the  Minister 
Plenipotentiary  of  the  Republic.  I  will  send  you  these 
letters  as  soon  as  you  will  let  me  know  your  determi- 
nation. 

Receive,  Sir,  the  assurance  of  my  high  consideration.

The  Deputation  felt  very  deeply,  as  indeed  they 
have  had  cause  to  do  throughout,  the  kindness  of 
the  Foreign  Minister,  from  whom  they  had  now 
the  offer  of  official  introductions  at  Rome.  On 
Monday,  the  29th,  at  an  early  interview,  General 
Rulhieres,  Minister  of  War,  gave  them  similar 
letters  from  his  department.  He  also  offered  to 
procure  the  Deputation  an  interview  with  General 
d'Hautpoul,  who  was  about  to  be  sent  to  Rome  to 


PACIUmS  OFFBRBD  FOR  JOURNBY  TO  PARIS.  69 

supersede  M.  de  Corcelles  and  General  Rostolan  in 
the  double  capcity  of  diplomatic  and  military  chief. 

The  Deputation  felt  very  forcibly  the  anxious 
situation  in  which  these  very  facilities  placed  them. 
On  the  one  hand,  the  Government  had  declined 
to  accept  the  responsibility  of  preventing  their 
journey  ;  they  were  free  to  go — and  by  not  going 
they  might  peril  the  cause  of  their  friend.  On  the 
other  hand,  they  might,  by  going,  involve  their 
cause  in  serious  complications,  and  expose  to 
inconvenience  a  Government  which  had  manifested 
a  kind  feeling  towards  their  object. 

After  consultation,  and  seeking  Divine  direction, 
they  arrived  at  the  conclusion  to  adopt  a  middle 
course.  Two  days  previously,  Mr.  Lewis  Tonna, 
of  Whitehall-yard,  an  attached  personal  friend  of 
Dr.  Achilli,  had  been  written  to,  requesting  him 
to  come  over  to  Paris  immediately.  Being 
thoroughly  familiar  with  the  Italian  language,  it 
had  occurred  to  the  Deputation  that  it  would  be 
very  desirable  to  induce  him  to  accompany  to  Rome 
those  members  of  the  Deputation  who  might  go 
there.  It  was  now,  however,  determined,  that  instead 
of  any  of  those  persons  going  to  Rome  who  had 
been  publicly  appointed  at  Glasgow  by  a  Pro- 
testant Society,  others  should  be  substituted,  whose 
interest  in  Dr.  Achilli  as  his  personal  friends  would 


70  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLL 

render  it  natural  for  them  to  visit  him,  and  unna- 
tural for  the  Cardinals  to  obstruct  them.  It  was 
arranged  that  Mr.  Tonna,  on  his  arrival,  should  be 
invited  to  undertake  this  duty.  M.  Meyrueis,  a 
French  gentleman  and  member  of  the  Alliance,  who 
had  resided  several  years  in  Florence,  and  had  met 
Dr.  Achilli  there  last  winter,  kindly  engaged  to 
accompany  him. 

On  Tuesday  morning,  the  30th,  Mr.  Tonna 
arrived,  and  consented  to  the  proposal.  The  Depu- 
tation, with  that  gentleman,  immediately  waited  on 
Lord  Normanby,  who  approved  the  determination  of 
the  Deputation  not  to  go  to  Rome,  and  said  that  he 
not  only  saw  no  objection  to  the  course  proposed,  but 
thought  that  some  advantage  might  arise  from  it. 
His  lordship  undertook  to  see  the  Ministers  of  War 
and  Foreign  Affairs,  and  to  procure  the  introductions 
in  favour  of  the  new  names.  Mr.  Cowan  left  Paris 
for  the  annual  meeting  of  the  Alliance  at  Lyons,  in 
the  confidence  that  everything  was  now  arranged. 

But  the  next  day,  October  31,  all  was  again  in 
confusion.  In  the  morning,  rumours  were  current 
of  a  change  of  Ministry ;  and,  in  the  afternoon,  these 
were  verified  by  the  announcement,  in  the  National 
Assembly,  that  Louis  Napoleon  had  dismissed  his 
Cabinet,  and  appointed  another,  with  General 
d'Hautpoul,  the  intended  Ambassador  and   Com- 


ALTBBID  MISSION  TO  R01IB--CIIANGB  0?  MINI8TRT.  71 

mander  at  Rome,  at  its  liead,  as  the  Minister  of 
\\'ar  and  interim  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs. 

Tlie  following  morning,  November  1,  Lord  Nor- 
manby  was  again  seen.  He  said  that  he  could  not  at 
present  trouble  the  new  Ministers  about  the  letters  of 
recommendation  ;  but  that  he  would  introduce  the 
Deputation  to  M.deViel  Castel,  Under  Secretary  of 
State  for  the  Foreign  Department,  who  might  be 
asked  for  the  letters. 

Tlie  same  evening,  at  a  large  meeting  of  French 
and  English  brethren  at  the  Hotel  Bristol,  it  was 
determined  that  MM.  Tonna  and  Meyrueis  should 
leave  Paris  for  Rome  at  once ;  and  that  as  they 
wished  to  go  round  by  Geneva,  for  purposes  con- 
nected with  their  mission,  and  thence  back  to  Lyons, 
the  expected  official  introductions  should  follow  them 
there.  Tlie  brethren  commended  them  in  prayer, 
together  with  their  imprisoned  friend,  to  the  Divine 
guardianship ;  and  the  next  day,  November  2,  they 
started  for  Geneva,  Lyons,  and  Rome.  Dr.  Steane 
returned  to  England;  Mr.  Cowan  being  written  to,  at 
Lyons,  to  return  speedily  to  Paris,  and  fill  his  place. 

Saturday,  November  3,  Mr.  Noel  and  myself 
waited  on  M.  de  Viel  Castel,  at  the  Foreign  Office, 
accompanied  by-  the  Hon.  R.  Edwardes,  Secretary 
of  the  British  Embassy.  M.  de  Viel  Castel,  on 
seeing  M.  de  Tocijueville's  written  promise  to  tliat

effect,  said,  that  he  could  not  refuse  to  undertake  to 
obtain  from  General  d'Hautpoul,  the  head  of  the  new 
Government,  Minister  of  War,  and  acting  Foreign 
Minister,  the  required  introduction.  This  was  sub- 
sequently given, — the  following  is  a  translation : — 

TO  M.  DE  CORCELLES,  MINISTER  OF  FRANCE  AT  ROME. 

Sir, 

This  letter  will  be  conveyed  to  you  by  Mr.  Tonna,  an 
English  subject,  and  by  M.  Meyrueis,  of  Paris,  friends  of 
Dr.  Acbilli,  who  visit  Rome  with  the  intention  of  acting 
in  his  favour. 

They  perfectly  comprehend,  as  I  believe,  the  necessity 
of  using  extreme  caution,  for  the  sake  even  of  the  object 
Avhich  they  have  in  view ;  and  I  doubt  not  that  they  will 
receive  with  great  deference  the  advice  which  you  may 
give  them  to  that  eflfect. 

If  you  do  not  see  great  inconvenience,  and  if  there  are 
not  insurmountable  difficulties,  they  would  desire  to  be 
enabled  to  converse  with  Dr.  Achilli,  and  to  know  the 
accusations  which  are  laid  against  him.  I  beg  you  to  be 
good  enough  to  render  them  all  the  good  offices  which 
may  be  in  your  power. 

Receive  the  assurance  of  my  high  consideration. 
(Signed)  D'HAUTPOUL. 

Tlie  Deputation  were  strongly  advised  by  M. 
Vienot,  an  old  officer,  and  an  ardent  friend  of  their 
object,  to  call  on  General  Oudinot,  to  whom  he 
undertook  to  introduce  them.  To  their  objection 
that  Dr.  Achilli,  if  arrested  at  all  by  French 
authority,  was  arrested  with  the  General's  cogni- 
sance, it  was  replied,  that  his  character  was  little 


AID  TROM  5SW  MINISTBT  AND  FROM  QENBRAL  OUDINOT.    73^ 

understood  by  the  public ;  that,  with  all  his  Con- 
stTvative  di9|K)sitions,  he  was  a  man  incapable  of 
religious  oppression ;  and  that  his  soldierlike  frank- 
ness  was  such,   that  he   would  at   once   tell   the 
Deputation  whether  he  was  friendly  to  their  object, 
and    was   willing   to    promote   it.      On    Monday 
morning,    November    5,    Mr.    Noel,    M.   Vienot, 
and    myself,   waited   by   appointment  on  General 
Oudinot.      He    entered    into    lively   conversation 
witli  us,  and   told  us  that  the    only  occasion   on 
which  he  had  seen  Dr.  Achilli,  was  when  the  latter 
came  to  the  French  camp,  with  a  Roman  deputation, 
after  the  first  assault  on  the  city,  to  assure  the  Gene- 
ral of  the  good  treatment  of  the  French  prisoners. 
He  expressed  his  conviction  as  strongly  as  the  late 
Ministers,  tliat  there  must  be  some  mistake  about 
the  arrest;  that  the  orders  of  the  Government  to 
him  were  precise  to  be  a  party  to  no  apprehensions  on 
religious  grounds ;  and  that  he  had,  in  fact,  allowed 
none  of  that  description.      Though  the  General  did 
not  say  so,  we  afterwards  learned  from  M.  de  la  Tour 
d'Auvergne,  Secretary  of  Embassy  at  Rome,  that 
application  was  made  to  General  Oudinot  to  autho- 
rise the  arrest  of  Achilli,  and  was  actually  refused. 
He  readily  promised  letters  of  introduction  to  M. 
de  la  Tour  d'Auvergne  and  to  Colonel  Espivant, 
Attached  to  the  Embassy ;  and  desired  his  Secretary, 


74  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

who  was  present  during  the  interview,  to  prepare 
them  immediately  for  his  signature.  The  Deputation, 
at  the  end  of  their  visit,  were  quite  inclined  to  con- 
cur in  the  correctness  of  the  view  expressed  by  M. 
Vienot  of  General  Oudinot's  dispositions. 

The  same  morning,  Mr.  Noel  saw  Lord  Nor- 
manby,  who  had  just  seen  the  Prime  Minister, 
General  d'Hautpoul,  from  whom  he  said  that  he 
"  had  received  such  satisfactory  assurances  of  the 
intentions  of  the  Government,  that  he  (Lord  N.) 
believed  the  Deputation  might  safely  leave  the 
matter  to  be  settled  between  himself  and  the  French 
Ministers."  This  circumstance  made  us  feel  very 
uncertain  as  to  what  might  be  the  path  of  duty 
with  reference  to  allowing  our  brethren  to  proceed 
to  Rome.  It  was,  however,  determined  to  write  to 
them  at  Lyons,  in  order  to  delay  their  progress  for 
a  short  time.  A  letter,  of  which  the  following  is  an 
extract,  was  written  to  the  British  Ambassador,  and 
is  inserted  here  as  illustrating  the  uniform  wish  of 
the  Deputation  to  be  guided  by  Lord  Normanby's 
kind  advice  in  the  whole  affair. 

SIR  CULLING  EARDLEY  TO  LORD  NORMANBY. 

Hotel  Beistol,  November  6,  1849. 
My  dear  Lord, 

Mr.  Noel  has  mentioned  to  me  your  advice,  and  the 
grounde  on  which  it  is  founded.     We  write  by  to-night's 


MB88Ba  10NNA  AND  KBTRUBI8  DBLATBD  ON  THB  BOAO.  75 

post  to  our  friends  who  are  going  to  Lyons,  begging  them 
to  delay  their  departure  for  Rome  till  the  arrival  of  the 
next  post.         •        •        • 

I  have  just  received  a  letter  of  introduction  from 
General  d'Hautpool,  of  which  I  enclose  a  copy  ;  and 
General  Oudinot  promised  us  others,  this  morning,  to  the 
French  flmbassy  in  Rome.  It  is  essential  to  us  to  clear 
Achilli's  character,  by  local  inquiries;  but  our  friends, 
if  they  went  to  Rome,  might  totally  abstain  for  a  few 
days  from  any  communication  with  the  French  authorities 
which  perhaps,  afler  all,  the  kindness  of  the  French 
Government  may  render  necessary.         •        •        • 

Believe  me,  my  Lord,  with  sincere  obligation  for  your 

cordial  help. 

Your  faithful  and  obedient  servant, 

C.  E.  EARDLEY. 

To  H.  E.  the  Marquis  of  Normanby. 

Lord  Normanby  was  satisfied,  on  seeing  the 
terms  of  General  d'Hautpoul's  introduction,  that 
MM.  Tonna  and  Meynieis  might  safely  proceed 
to  Rome,  and  advice  was  accordingly  sent  to  them 
to  do  so,  which  overtook  them  at  Marseilles. 

The  following  are  the  most  important  portions 
of  the  letter  in  which  that  opinion  was  communi- 
cated:— 

Paris,  Hotel  Bmtol,  Kot.  9,  1840. 
My  drab  Sir, 

We  think  at  last  that  you  had  better  at  once  proceed 
to  Rome.  •  •  •  • 

If  we  knew  that  positive  orders  were  gone  to  Rome  for 
our  friend's  liberation,  or  that  conditional  orders  had  been 
sent  to  liberate  him  in  the  event  of  certain  contingencies 


76  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

which  we  knew  to  be  facts,  we  should  feel  it  right  to  ask 
you  to  relinquish  the  journey  which,  at  the  request  of  the 
Deputation,  you  have  suspended  for  two  or  three  days.  It 
cannot  be  denied  that  there  is  a  bare  possibility  of  the  object 
of  your  journey  being  known  to  the  Pontifical  authorities, 
and  of  their  jealousy  being  thus  excited,  and  the  kind 
intentions  of  the  French  Government  thwarted.  Small  as 
is  that  risk,  we  would  not  recommend  you  to  incur  it 
needlessly. 

But  as  we  are  not  in  a  situation  to  know  that  the 
orders  sent  are  conclusive,  we  do  not  think  it  would  be 
right  further  to  interfere  to  prevent  your  continuing  your 
journey. 

The  instructions  sent  by  the  French  Government  to 
Eome,  may  prove  to  have  left  an  amount  of  discretion 
to  the  Ambassador  and  General,  which  your  presence 
there,  and  your  statement  of  the  merits  of  the  case,  may 
decide  those  authorities  to  make  use  of  in  Achilli's  favour. 
There  is  also  another  view  of  the  case.  It  is  possible, 
though  highly  improbable,  that  the  prospect  of  our  friend's 
deliverance  may  be  less  good  than  we  anticipate.  Obstacles 
may  be  raised.  Delays  may  intervene.  The  Pope  may 
return.  The  French  forces  may  be  withdrawn.  And 
Dr.  Achilli  may  be  left  in  the  hands  of  the  Inquisition. 
In  that  case  it  will  be  of  great  importance  to  be  in 
possession  of  aU  the  facts,  in  order  that  they  may  be 
used  in  his  defence,  and  that,  as  a  last  resource,  we  may 
bring  them  to  bear  on  European  public  opinion. 

Notwithstanding  the  above  reasons  for  your  going, 
we  should  have  hesitated  about  the  expediency  of  your 
journey,  if  the  French  Government  or  Lord  Normanby 
had  strongly  pressed  its  relinquishment. 

But  you  will  see,  by  the  enclosed  letter  of  introduction 
in  favour  of  yourself  and  M.  Meyrueis  from  General 
d'Hautpoul  to  M.  de  Corcelles,  that  every  facility  will  be 
given  you  at  the  French  Embassy,  and  that  no  objection 


LBTTBR  TO  MR.  TON'NA— TO  PR0CRm&gt;-00UN8BLS.  77 

is  felt  to  your  journey  provided  you  use  the  utmost  cir- 
cumspection. 

Lord  Normanby,  also,  in  a  letter  dated  the  7th,  says, 
that  he  "  sees  no  objection  to  those  gentlemen  undertaking 
the  journey  to  Rome,  provided  they  conform  to  the  request 
of  General  d'Hautpoul,  that  they  should  be  cautious  that 
their  proceedings,  when  there,  should  not  be  calculated  to 
create  greater  difficulties  than  at  present  appear  to  exist;" 
and  he  confirmed  this  opinion  when  we  saw  him  yesterday. 

Our  advice  to  you,  therefore,  is,  to  go  as  rapidly  as  you 
can  to  Rome,  and  to  present  at  the  French  Embassy  the 
enclosed  letter  from  General  d'Hautpoul,  Minister  of  War, 
and  acting  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs,  to  M.  de  Corcelle; 
and  the  other  two  letters,  which  General  Oudinot  has  been 
good  enough  to  give,  for  you  and  M.  Meyrueis,  to 
M.  de  la  Tour  d'Auvergne,  Secretary  of  Embassy,  and 
Colonel  Eepivant,  Attached  to  the  Embassy. 

We  think  you  will  be  wise  to  put  yourselves  very 
much  into  the  hands  of  the  Ambassador,  to  act  under  his 
advice,  and  especially  to  abstain  as  much  as  possible  from 
all  needless  conversation  or  proceedings  which  might  make 
the  object  of  your  journey  notorious  in  Rome.  If  two, 
three,  or  four  persons  necessarily  know  the  fact,  they 
should  be  engaged  not  to  mention  it.  It  may  not  be 
useless  to  suggest  to  the  gentlemen  of  the  Embassy  them- 
selves, that  while  you  take  this  course,  it  is  very  advisable 
that,  by  them  also,  your  object  in  Rome  should  not  be  made 
the  subject  of  conversation. 

We  advise  your  asking  liberty  at  once  to  see  the 
spedfie  aoeosations  against  Dr.  Achilli.  You  will  judge 
beet  about  requesting  permission  to  visit  himself  at  once. 
If  you  can  do  so  without  attracting  much  attention,  it 
seems  to  us  that  it  may  be  as  well,  for  in  the  case  of  the 
Pontifical  jealousy  being  aroused,  and  of  your  being 
suddenly  sent  out  of  Rome,  you  would  regret  not  having 
received  explanations  from  his  own  lips. 


78  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

We  will  now  add  a  few  observations  on  the  object  of 
your  journey. 

The  French  Government  have  just  learned,  for  the  first 
time,  that  Dr.  Achilli's  arrest  was  effected  without  any 
sanction  by  the  French  police  in  Rome. 

It  seems,  therefore,  important  to  ascertain — 

1st,  The  exact  hour,  as  well  as  day,  of  his  arrest. 

2nd,  The  exact  hour  and  day  of  General  Oudinot's 
transfer  of  the  Executive  Government  to  the  Cardinals, 
up  to  which  time  the  French  police  were,  as  we  believe, 
the  only  legal  police  of  the  city. 

3rd,  The  names  of  the  persons  who  arrested  him,  and 
whether  they  are  known  agents  of  the  Vicar  of  Rome. 

4th,  The  exact  words  they  used ;  that  is  to  say, 
whether  it  can  be  proved  that  they  arrested  him  in  the 
name  of  the  French  Prefect  of  Police ;  whether  they 
addressed  him  by  his  own,  or  by  what  name,  and  whether 
they  refused  to  produce  a  warrant. 

5th,  What  offence  was  imputed  to  him  at  first,  and 
whether,  since  the  interference  of  the  French  Govern- 
ment from  Paris,  it  has  been  attempted  to  change  the 
ground  of  complaint,  and  substitute  other  accusations. 

It  will  be  useful  to  know  all  other  particulars  of  his 
imprisonment,  such  as  the  officials  before  whom  he  has 
been  successively  taken,  and  the  time  and  reason  of  his 
transfer  from  one  place  of  confinement  to  another ;  was 
the  transfer  exclusively  from  the  interference  of  friends, 

or  in  part  at  the  instance  of  the  Inquisition. 

»  *     ■  »  * 

Next  to  Dr.  Achilli's  deliverance,  we  feel  very  anxious 
that  his  character  should  be  cleared.  We  have  scarcely 
alluded  to  the  accusation  of  seduction  and  murder  twenty 
years  ago,  now  made  against  him,  so  absurd  and  contra- 
dictory do  the  facts  which  he  quotes,  and  which  we  hope 
may  be  verified,  lead  us  to  deem  it.  We  trust  you  will  suc- 
ceed in  satisfying  his  friends  that  the  whole  is  a  mere  pretext. 


LBITBR  TO  MR.  TONWA— AVOID  PROPAGANDISM.  79 

Wo  Strongly  advise  your  abstaining  from  anything 
that  might  be  interpreted  as  a  Protestant  Propaganda  in 
Rome.  It  is  important  that  the  Papal  authorities  should 
have  no  such  plea  against  you. 

It  will  be  well  to  say,  on  all  occasions,  that  you  are 
come  as  an  attached  personal  friend  of  Dr.  Achilli,  and 
that  M.  Meyrueis  has  accompanied  you  from  his  know- 
ledge of  Italy,  and  his  acquaintance  with  Dr.  Achilli  and 
his  friends ;  and  that,  though  the  Deputation  of  the  Evan- 
gelical Alliance,  appointed  at  Glasgow,  has  thankfully 
promoted  your  journey,  you  are  not,  properly  speaking, 
part  of  that  Deputation.  We  have  abstained  from  going 
to  Rome  on  purpose  to  avoid  any  complaint  that  the 
Papal  Government  might  make  against  such  a  mission  of 
a  Protestant  Society.  We,  therefore,  leave  the  sub- 
ject in  your  hands.  And  I  now  put  this  upon  record,  to 
be  referred  to,  if  needful,  hereafter.  •  •  • 
Believe  me,  my  dear  sir, 

Faithfully  yours, 

C.  E.  EARDLEY. 
L.  H.  J.  ToNNA,  Esq.,  Marseilles. 

P.S. — Information  which  has  reached  us  leads  us  to 
believe  that  the  greatest  importance  attaches  to  your  being 
able  to  prove,  by  documents,  that  Dr.  Achilli  has  received 
ecclesiastical  honours,  especially  within  the  Roman  States, 
since  the  time  of  his  imputed  crime.  It  is  asserted  that  it 
is  not  so,  and  that  they  took  the  first  opportunity  of  his 
return  to  the  Roman  States  to  arrest  him. 

I  am  sure  I  need  not  press  on  you  the  importance  of 
so  acting  in  the  matter,  that  if  the  accusation  of  his  enemies 
should  be  verified  (which  I  will  not  anticipate),  nothing 
should  have  been  done  which  might  be  regretted,  or  which 
would  compromise  the  cause  of  the  common  faith. 

The  papers  this  morning  announce  tbat  General

your  introduction  to  the  one  will  be  of  equal  use  to  the 
other. 

On  Saturday,  November  10th,  I  had  an  interview 
with  M.  de  Viel  Castel,  Under  Secretary  of  State,  at 
the  Foreign  Ofl5ce,  who  corroborated  the  information 
previously  given  by  Lord  Normanby,  that  the  French 
authorities  at  Rome  stated  positively  that  there  had 
been  no  participation  on  the  part  of  the  French 
military  or  police  in  Dr.  Achilli's  arrest.  It  was 
replied,  that  we  could  only  say  that  we  had  received 
contrary  information,  and  that  inquiry  on  the  spot, 
in  Rome,  would  soon  ascertain  the  fact.  On  my 
application,  M.  de  Viel  Castel  then  promised  to  send 
us,  through  a  mutual  friend  (Mr.  Rumpff,  the 
minister  of  the  German  Free  Towns),  particulars  of 
the  criminal  accusations  which  had  been  transmitted 
to  the  Foreign  Office  against  Dr.  Achilli.  In  answer 
to  M.  de  Viel  Castel's  inquiry  whether  it  was 
wished  to  have  extracts  from  the  despatches  textu- 
ellement  (verbatim),  it  was  replied  that  an  abstract 
would  be  quite  sufficient.* 


•  I  received  in  December  the  promised  communication ;  but  it 
contained  no  reference  whatever  to  the  original  accusations  agninst 
Achilli.  It  consisted  of  a  double  plea :  first,  that  the  French  force, 
military  and  civil,  had  no  share  whatever  in  the  arrest ;  and,  secondly, 
that  the  Vicar  General  had  a  right  to  order  the  arrest  of  Dr.  Achilli  ns 
he  did.  The  second  point  was  expounded  at  length,  and  the  grounds 
assigned  for  his  seizure  were — Ist,  his  former  escape  from  the  prisons

On  the  13th  November,  the  last  member  of  the 
Deputation  had  returned  to  England. 


The  scene  now  changes  from  Paris  to  Rome, 
where,  on  November  20,  MM.  Touna  and  Mey- 
nieis  arrived,  having  on  their  way  passed  some 
days  with  the  brethren  in  Geneva,  Lyons,  and  Mar- 
seilles; at  each  of  which  places  prayer  was  offered  for 
Dr.  Achilli,  and  conversations  were  held  on  the  intro- 
duction of  religion  and  religious  freedom  into  Italy.

having  published  several  works,  not  only  opposed  but  offensive  to  the 
Pope  and  to  the  Holy  Sei,  helped  in  printing  in  Rome  itself  a  traru- 
Ution  of  the  New  Testament  condemned  by  the  Court  ofJiome." 

We  must  not  be  severe  upon  the  French  Government,  either  for 
keefiing  back  the  original  accusations,  or  for  appearing  to  endorse  the 
new  ooci.  Before  the  above-mentioned  document  was  sent  to  me,  it 
bad  begOB  to  transpire  that  the  imputations  onginnlly  transmitted

expoMire  which  would  result  from  the  publication  of  official  despatches 
containing  downright  untruths.  France  has  since  shown,  by  Dr. 
AehilK's  Uberatioo,  that  though  she  wished  to  spare  the  feelings  of 
the  oppTHsor,  she  felt  at  became  her  for  the  oppressed,  and  there

82  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

On  the  21st  November,  they  waited  on  Mr. 
Freeborn,  H.  B.  M.  Consular  Agent,  who  gave  a 
rapid  sketch  of  all  the  facts  relating  to  Dr.  Achilli. 
Most  of  these  were  either  already  known  to  them, 
or  will  be  found  embodied,  with  other  information 
obtained  in  Rome,  in  Mr.  Tonna's  report  on  his 
return  to  London,  dated  December  17. 

Mr.  Freeborn  also  told  them  that  he  saw  him 
during  the  Republic,  while  the  siege  of  Rome  was 
pending,  and  that  he  advised  him  to  make  his  escape 
whenever  the  city  should  be  taken ;  but  that  Achilli 
replied  he  had  a  mission  to  accomplish,  and  that  he 
had  done  nothing  to  oblige  him  to  escape.  Achilli 
had  a  perfect  confidence  in  the  character  of  the 
French  rule,  as  a  guarantee  for  his  personal  liberty. 
Mr.  Freeborn  saw  him  on  Sunday  last,  and  found 
him  perfectly  well  in  body  and  mind.  He  was  much 
astonished  at  his  firmness  of  mind,  not  shaken  during 
a  captivity  of  four  months ;  whereas  many  others, 
acquaintances  of  his  own,  were  utterly  cast  down 
after  a  confinement  of  a  few  weeks.  He  said,  that 
even  had  other  proofs  of  his  innocence  been  wanting, 
it  was  sufficient  for  his  own  satisfaction  to  recall 
what  had  occurred  at  their  interview.  "But  Dr. 
Achilli,"  he  said,  "  you  are  guilty  of  a  great  crime, — 
you  poisoned  a  nun."  Achilli  heard  and  answered 
him  with  such  perfect  serenity  of  countenance,  as 


MR.  rRUBORN-lf.  DB  OORCSLLBa-OINIRAL  B.  IVHILLIBRd.    83 

to  convince  him  of  the  falsehood  of  tlie  charge.  Mr. 
Freeborn  had,  besides,  procured  positive  proofs 
of  Achilli's  innocence,  obtained  by  two  persons,  one 
a  Roman  barrister  attached  to  the  Consulate,  the 
particulars  of  which  will  be  detailed  hereafter. 

Tlie  same  day,  MM.  Tonnaand  Meyrueis  waited 
on  M.  de  Corcelles,  tlie  French  Ambassador.  They 
were  shown  into  a  waiting-room ;  and  while  there. 
General  Baraguey  d'Hilliers  arrived,  who  had  come 
to  replace  M.  de  Corcelles  in  his  functions.  After 
tlie  lapse  of  an  hour,  M.  de  Corcelles  passed  through 
the  waiting-r»3om,  and  our  friends  placed  in  his 
hands  their  letter  from  the  Prime  Minister,  M. 
d'Hautpoul.  He  told  them  that  he  was  engaged 
with  the  General  in  handing  over  affairs  to  him, 
and  that,  as  Achilli's  case  was  among  them,  he  would 
submit  M.  dTIautpoul's  letter  to  the  General,  and 
would  have  the  pleasure  of  presenting  them  to  him. 
Accordingly,  in  half-an-hour,  he  came  for  them; 
and,  after  they  were  introduced,  the  General  told 
them  that,  before  leaving  Paris,  M.  d'Hautpoul  and 
Lord  Normanby  had  both  spoken  to  him  about  Dr. 
Achilli,  as  whose  friends  they  were  come.  He  said 
that  they  must  be  aware  that  it  was  a  very  delicate 
affair.  France'  was  fully  prepared  to  use  her  good 
offices  witii  the  Holy  Father ;  but  her  responsibility 
was  in  no  way  engaged,  and  he  thought  tlie  best

way  to  obtain  the  desired  end  would  be  by  appealing 
to  the  Holy  Father's  clemency.  In  a  few  days  he 
should  go  to  Portici,  and  would  do  all  in  his  power 
to  obtain  an  act  of  clemency  in  favour  of  their  co- 
religionaire.  "  But,"  he  added,  *'  you  understand 
that  France  is  not  responsible.    Vous  entendez  Men.'* 

M.  de  Corcelles,  the  late  Plenipotentiary,  then 
added,  that  General  Oudinot  had  not,  in  any  way, 
been  mixed  up  with  the  affair ;  and  that  the  tem- 
poral and  spiritual  authority  of  the  Pope  being 
re-established,  the  Vicegerent,  or  Vicar  of  Rome, 
had  the  right  to  act  as  he  had  done ;  that  the 
French  Prefect  of  Police  had  declared  that  there 
was  no  trace  to  be  found  on  his  registers  (registres 
matricules)  of  the  apprehension  of  Dr.  Achilli  by  the 
French  force ;  that  he,  M.  de  Corcelles,  had  done 
nothing  beyond  obtaining  from  the  Cardinals  the 
information  which  the  French  Government  had 
charged  him  to  seek  ;  that  he  could  not  undertake 
an  inquiry  into  the  acts  of  a  friendly  and  independ- 
ent Government;  and  that  France  was  not  con- 
cerned in  the  affair,  &amp;c.,  &amp;c. 

MM.  Tonna  and  Meyrueis  entered  at  length 
into  the  question,  urging  the  duty  of  France  to  vin- 
dicate herself  from  the  fraudulent  use  of  her  name  in 
the  arrest,  and  stating  the  views  and  footing  on 
which  they  were  come.     They  then  stated  the  infor- 


DB7BNCB  or  THB  CAHDINJLLS— CEDTIFICATB  OF  ARRB6T.      85 

matioD  which  they  had  received  as  to  the  mode  of 
arrest,  of  which  the  following  certificate  was  placed 
in  the  hands  of  the  General  on  November  27  : — 

RoMJ^  Nov.  13,  1849. 

We  hereby  solemnly  declare  that  we  were  living  with 
Dr.  Achilli  in  Rome,  at  the  Palazzetto  Borghese,  when, 
on  the  29th  July,  1849,  at  eleven  o'clock  of  the  night,  hav- 
ing heard  some  one  knock,  we  opened  the  door,  and  three 
men  immediately  entered,  who  announced  themselves  aa 
police  agents  of  the  French  Prefect.  They  inquired  for 
a  person  of  the  name  of  Domenico  Antonio  Achilli ;  we 
answered  that  a  gentleman  lived  there  whose  name  was 
Achilli,  but  tliat  Giacinto  was  his  name,  and  not  Domenico 
Antonio  ;  and  as  he  was  firm  in  declaring  his  real  name, 
they  became  exceedingly  insolent,  and  threatened  to  place 
two  guards  to  watch  him,  if  he  did  not  avow  hia  name  to 
be  that  which  they  asserted.  Dr.  Achilli  then  replied, 
that  the  question  being,  as  it  appeared,  merely  concerning 
the  identity  of  his  name,  he  had  no  difficulty  whatever  in 
going  with  them  to  the  French  Prefect  of  Police  (as  they 
had  already  signified  to  him),  but  he  simply  intended  to 
go  to  rectify  the  apparent  mistake  respecting  his  real 
name ;  so  he  went  off  with  them,  but  did  not  return 
again. 

We  hereby  also  declare,  that  the  agents  of  the  police 
did  not  produce  any  warrant  or  written  order  from  the 
legal  authorities,  for  Dr.  Achilli's  arrest.  The  whole  of 
what  we  have  above  stated  passed  in  our  presence,  and 
we  are  ready  to  affirm  it  also  by  our  oath.

ELIZABETH  (IIELY)  DOLCI. 

M.  de  Corcellea  replied  that  the  circumstance 
was  new  to  him ;  that  he  did  not  understand  why 


86  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

the  Pontifical  authority  should  have  used  any  sub- 
terfuge, as  they  had  no  need  to  do  so,  for  they  de- 
clared openly  that  Dr.  Achilli  was  seized  on  religious 
grounds.  Suspicions  of  criminality  had  been  enter- 
tained against  him  in  former  times,  but  of  these  he 
had  been  acquitted,  and  had  been  subsequently 
entrusted  with  important  offices  in  the  Church  (revetu 
posterieurement  d'emplois  importans  dans  VEglise)  ; 
and  that  his  abjuration  was  the  cause  of  the  present 
proceedings  against  him.  M.  de  Corcelles  twice 
repeated  this  statement  during  their  interview. 

Our  friends  pressed  on  the  two  diplomatists  the 
responsibility  of  France  for  the  use  of  her  name  in 
the  arrest.  This  the  General  did  not  admit;  but 
added,  that  he  should  be  very  glad  to  have  such  a 
weapon  to  use  in  his  interview  with  the  Holy  Father. 
He  then  spoke  of  the  matter  being  of  importance, 
because  it  excited  interest  in  England ;  but  this  did 
not  allow  France  to  overlook  the  prerogatives  of 
the  Pontifical  Government. 

As  they  were  rising  to  go  away,  M.  de  Corcelles 
asked  if  Achilli  were  married,  for  that  when  he 
was  arrested,  a  woman  was  found  with  him.  The 
General  then  said,  "  That  is  a  matter  for  you  to 
investigate.  You  would  not,  gentlemen,  take  the 
part  of  a  man  who  was  living  with  a  person  who 
was  not   his   wife."     They  replied  that  they  were 


DTPrr«»pmN  with  thb  diplomatists.  87 

not  yet  in  a  situation  to  furnish  any  proofs  of  Dr. 
Achilli  being  legally  marrie&lt;i,  but  that  this  was 
exactly  one  of  the  points  which  they  were  come  to 
investigate ;  that  they  were  deeply  impressed  with 
the  importance  of  ascertaining  Dr.  Achilli's  perfect 
morality,  thougli  they  had  no  doubt  on  the  subject. 

Our  friends  then  requested,  that,  in  accordance 
with  the  directions  of  General  d'Hautpoul,  they 
might,  if  possible,  be  permitted  to  speak  with  the 
prisoner,  and  also  to  see  the  accusatory  documents 
which  must  exist.  To  the  former  request,  the 
General  promised  to  obtain  an  answer.  To  the 
latter,  M.  de  Corcelles  replied  that  "  there  were  no 
documents  to  consult"  ("aMcwn  dossier  ^  con- 
suiter**).  It  is  impossible  to  refrain  from  comment- 
ing on  this  avowal.  The  French  diplomatists  in 
Rome  had  forwarded  to  Paris,  and,  upon  demands 
for  explanation,  had  repeated  more  than  once,  accu- 
sations imperilling  the  life  of  a  prisoner  of  the 
Inquisition.  It  now  appears  that  these  statements 
were  transmitted  without  those  who  transmitted  them 
having  ever  received  any  written  statement  whatever 
from  the  accusers ! 

On  Thursday,  November  22,  M.  Begre,  the  Swiss 
Consul,  informed  our  friends,  that  when  he  and  his 
family  had  advised  Dr.  Achilli  to  quit  Rome,  he 
had  always  replied,  "  I  have  done  nothing  to  make 


88  IMPEISONMEiNT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLL 

nie  fly.  From  the  French  I  have  nothing  to  fear ; 
and  as  long  as  the  Pope  keeps  away,  I  may  remain 
here."  He  had  always  expressed  the  strongest  con- 
fidence in  God  for  the  success  of  his  work;  and 
M.  Begre  understood  that  he  manifested  the  greatest 
joy  and  zeal  for  the  Gospel  in  his  prison,  where  his 
simple  and  eloquent  speech  and  energetic  character 
had  exercised  a  great  influence.  Dr.  Achilli,  during 
the  Republic,  used  to  enter  quietly  into  conversa- 
tion with  those  who  sate  near  him  at  the  cafes; 
and  often  those  to  whom  he  had  spoken  returned 
home  with  him,  and  remained  till  a  late  hour  convers- 
ing. He  did  not  meddle  with  politics ;  official  employ- 
ment was  offered  him,  and  he  might  easily  have  had 
a  seat  in  the  Assembly ;  but  he  refused  all,  always 
saying  that  he  had  another  mission  to  accomplish. 

On  the  subject  of  his  marriage,  M.  Begre  said 
that  he  had  seen  the  contract,  and  that  Dr.  Achilli 
had  evidently  endeavoured  to  clothe  his  union  with 
the  most  serious  character,  and  to  give  it  all  possible 
legality.  M.  Begre  had  received  his  bride  at  his 
house;  and  when,  from  motives  of  prudence,  she 
went  to  Florence  after  the  arrest,  Madame  Begre 
had  introduced  her  to  her  relations  there. 

The  same  day,  our  friends  had  the  opportunity 
of  learning,  that,  just  before  the  overthrow  of  the 
Republic,  several  thousand  persons  in  the  city  of 


PBTITIO.N  OP  nOMANS  TO  LORD  PALMBRSTON.  89 

Rome  were  ou  tlie  poiut  of  signing  a  petition  to 
Lord  Palmereton,  for  English  protection  to  evan- 
gelical worship. 

The  same  afternoon,  they  learnt  from  Mr.  Hely, 
and  other  members  of  Signora  Achilli's  family, 
particulars  concerning  the  arrest,  wliich  will  be 
found  detailed  in  M.  Tonna's  report  of  December  17. 
They  found  that  he  was  now  well  treated,  and  ascer- 
tained the  names  of  the  Physician,  and  of  the 
Captain,  of  tlie  Fortress. 

They  then  called  on  Mr.  Freeborn,  who  had 
seen  General  Baraguey  d'Hilliers,  and  had  been 
favourably  impressed  by  him.  The  General  had 
expressed  to  him  liis  fears  that  "  ces  Messieurs  etaient 
trop  arderiSy^  and  Mr.  Freeborn  again,  at  liis  desire, 
cautioned  them  to  be  calm,  discreet,  &amp;c. 

Mr.  Freeborn  handed  over  the  report  made  by 

Signor ,  after  the  investigation  which  he  had, 

at  the  instance  of  the  Deputation  to  Paris,  instituted 

at    Viterbo.      Signor  was   also    introduced, 

and  gave  an  emphatical  assurance  that  the  accusa- 
tion about  the  nun  was  an  utter  and  entire  fabrica- 
tion. The  substance  of  that  document  will  be  found 
hereafter  embodied  in  Mr.  Tonna's  rejwrt.  Two  days 
later,  Mr.  Freeborn,  in  tlie  presence  of  our  friends, 
unsealed  and  opened  Dr.  Achilli's  papers,  which  had 
been  placed  in  his  custody  after  the  arrest.     They

took  out  of  them  the  following  marriage-deed,  which 
they  read  with  great  satisfaction : — 

[Translation.] 
In  the  name  of  God  and  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ. 
The  first  year  of  the  Eoman  Republic. 
We,  the  undersigned,  attest  that  in  the  Christian 
Assembly  of  this  day,  after  the  usual  prayer  and  the 
reading  of  the  Word  of  God,  the  Rev.  Doctor  Giacinto 
Achilli,  born  m  wedlock,  in  Viterbo,  of  Antonio  Achilli, 
and  his  wife  Maria  Mencarini,.  has  publicly  contracted  a 
legal  marriage  with  Miss  Giuseppina  Hely,  born  in 
Rome,  of  Captain  James  Hely  and  his  wife  Marianna 
Wiggins,  both  English,  which  marriage  was  celebrated 
openly  and  legally,  according  to  the  law  of  the  Roman 
Republic,  and  in  the  manner  prescribed  by  our  Church ; 
the  contracting  parties  above-mentioned  giving  their 
mutual  consent,  on  the  demand  of  an  elder  thereunto 
appointed,  and  solemnly  declaring,  before  God  and  this 
congregation,  their  wish  to  be  henceforth  husband  and 
wife  for  all  their  life,  according  to  the  holy  Christian 
Law,  and  the  ordinances  of  Civil  Society.  In  con- 
firmation of  this,  they  first  have  subscribed  this  act, 
to  which  is  appended  the  signature  of  the  afore-mentioned 
elder  and  witnesses,  with  the  seal  of  our  Congregation. 

Given  in  Rome,  in  the  place  of  meeting,  this  day,

In  the  meantime,  the  efforts  of  our  friends  were 
incessant  to  ascertain  by  what  force  Dr.  Achilli  was 
carried  off  in  custody.  At  an  early  period  they  had 
obtained  evidence  that  he  was  escorted  by  French 
soldiers,  who  were  said  to  manifest  unwillingness  to 
fulfil  their  odious  task.  On  the  24th  November, 
they  were  told  that  these  were  Chasseurs  de  Vin- 
cennes,  whose  head-quarters  are  at  the  French 
Prefecture  of  Police !  One  person,  who  had  wit- 
nessed the  arrest,  was  employed  to  go  round  to 
their  quarters,  and  to  endeavour  to  find  the  corporal 
or  men  who  were  employed. 

On  Sunday,  November  25,  they  twice  visited 
the  Castle  of  St.  Angelo,  with  a  letter  from  the 
General,  authorising  them  to  transmit  money  to  Dr. 
Achilli,  through  the  Captain  Commandant.  The 
Captain  was  not  yet  arrived  in  his  quarters  on  either 
occasion ;  and  this  being  so,  they  availed  them- 
selves of  tlie  opportunity,  being  once  inside,  to 
examine  every  part  of  it  to  which  they  could  find 
access.     An  extract  from  their  journal,  relative  to

the  fortress  in  which  Dr.  Achilli  has  been  confined, 
cannot  fail  to  be  interesting  to  his  friends  : — 

We  first  crossed  a  drawbridge  Bpanning  the  first  or 
outer  ditch,  which  encircles  the  bastioned  enceinte.  We 
walked  quite  round  this.  On  each  of  the  four  bastions  a 
gun  is  mounted,  bearing  the  Pontifical  anus.  From  the 
height  of  this  wall  (which  commands  to  the  south  and  west 
a  view  of  Rome  and  of  the  Trastevere,  and  to  the  north  and 
east  of  the  Campagna),  we  looked  with  much  interest  on 
the  prisoners,  all  dressed  in  military  clothing,  who  were 
walking  in  the  deep  and  damp  ditch  which  separates  the 
enceinte  from  the  immense  tower.  The  base  of  this  latter 
is  of  ancient  construction.  We  then  crossed  another 
drawbridge,  which  spans  this,  the  second,  ditch,  and  we 
found  ourselves  at  the  entrance  of  a  long  staircase  or 
sloping  path  which  crosses,  in  a  straight  line,  the  whole 
width  of  the  tower.  It  was  dimly  lighted  and  intersected 
in  four  places  (as  we  ascended)  by  traps  and  drawbridges, 
each  of  which  would  afibrd  successive  positions  of  defence 
against  a  party  forcing  its  way  from  without.  On  reach- 
ing the  top,  we  turned  to  the  left,  and  amved  at  an  iron 
gate  guarded  hy  French  soldiers*  who,  seeing  the  uncon- 
cerned manner  in  which  we  walked  up,  concluded  that  we 
had  a  pass,  unlocked  the  gate,  and  admitted  us  to  a  plat- 
form or  court,  locking  the  gate  and  removing  the  key  after 
we  had  passed.  Above  this  court,  again,  rise  the  upper 
buildings  of  the  Castle,  in  which  the  more  important  poli- 
tical prisoners  are  kept,  and  amongst  them  our  friend. 
Further  than  this  wc  could  not  go. 

We  told  the  corporal  that  we  had  come  to  the  Castle  to 
see  the  Commandant,  and  we  were  informed  that,  if  he  were 
within,  we  should  find  him  below, — a  fact  which  we  knew 
very  well. 

*  Let  our  friendfl  mark— the  soldiers  inside  the  fortress  are  French. 


INTBRIOR  Of  THB  CASTLE— M.  A.  PR  D0MIXI8.  93 

Again  the  ponderous  gyrating  vvaa  unlocked,  and  we 
retraced  our  steps  down  the  long  and  gloomy  staircase ; 
and,  finding  that  the  Commandant  had  notarriv.d,  we  left 
the  fortress  with  a  depression  of  spirit  whicli  \vc  cuuld  not 
shake  off  for  the  rest  of  the  day.  • 

In  many  parts  of  the  Castle,  we  saw  inscribed  on  the 
walla  the  name  of  Alexander  VI.,  the  infamous  Borgia, 
and  particularly  an  immense  inscription  over  the  gateway 
of  the  tower — 

ALEXANDER   YI.    PONT.    MAX. 
RR8TAVRAVIT  ANNO.    SAL.    1495. 

In  walking  round  the  ramparts  we  repeatedly  stopped 
in  places  where  we  could  see  the  grated  and  boxed-up 
windows  of  the  prisoners,  in  the  hope  that  perhaps  our 
friend  might  be  looking  from  some  crevic6,  and  be  com- 
forted by  seeing  us. 


*  Well  migrht  our  friends  be  depressed,  if  they  thought  of  all  the 
gloomy  AMociations  connected  with  the  Castle  of  St.  Angelo.  One 
caae,  in  particular,  has  been  named  to  me  by  a  friend,  which  is  men- 
tioned in  Sir  J.  Gardener  Wilkinson's  "  Dalmatia''  (page  144,  kc.). 
It  ia  stated  that  Marc  Antonio  de  Domiais  published,  in  1611,  at 
Venice,  his  "Discovery  of  the  Theory  of  the  Prismatic  Colours,"  a  work 
to  which  Sir  Isaac  Newton  did  justice.  Educated  at  the  College  of 
Jesuits  at  Loretto,  he  became  Profesaor  of  Mathematics  at  Padua,  and 
of  Philosophy  at  Brescia.  He  was  appointed  by  Clement  YIII. 
Bishop  of  Segna,  in  Dalmatia ;  and,  in  1(H)3,  Archbishop  of  Spalato. 
In  1615,  he  TieiUed  his  see,  and  wrote  a  book  in  favour  of  the  Vene- 
tians and  against  the  Pope,  which  was  condemned  by  the  Inquisi- 
tion. He  went  to  Heidelberg,  in  Germany,  where  he  became  a 
Protestant.  At  the  instance  of  Sir  H.  Wotton,  Ambassador  of  James 
I.,  he  went  over  to  England,  and  was  made  Dean  of  Windsor.  He 
was  invited  back  to  Rmne  by  Gregory  XV.,  which  inviution  he 
credoloasly  accepted',  and  retomed  to  the  Roman  communion.  On 
the  death  of  that  Pope,  who  was  his  protector,  he  was  imprisoned  in 
th«CastI«of  St.  Angelo,  wktre  ki$  life  was  cut  short  (1625),  as  is 
supposed,  bjf  poisom ;  and  hi*  body  and  writings  were  buried  together 
in  the  Campo  di  Fiori,  in  the  city  of  Rome. 


94  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

The  next  day,  Monday,  November  26,  they 
succeeded  in  seeing  Captain  Gennari,  who  com- 
manded the  fort.  He  received  them  courteously, 
and,  without  waiting  for  questions,  said  that  Dr. 
Achilli  was  an  excellent  person  and  well-in- 
formed. He  assured  them  that  he  was  well  treated, 
and  that  he  was  in  company  with  Colonel  Calan- 
drelli,  and  two  ex-members  of  the  Constituent 
Assembly.  He  undertook  to  deliver  the  money 
into  Achilli's  hands,  and  consented  to  take  him 
their  cards ;  on  one  of  them  they  wrote  "  Fidati" 
(Trust !) — Romans  viii.,  and  on  the  other  in  Italian, 
"  And  now  remain  these  three,  faith,  hope,  and 
charity."  They  quitted  the  Castle  with  a  light 
heart. 

On  November  27,  they  saw  the  General  again, 
who  told  them  that  he  had  seen  the  Cardinal  Vicar 
on  the  subject  of  Achilli.  He  had  asked  him  that 
MM.  Tonna  and  Meyrueis  might  be  allowed  to  see 
the  documents  respecting  the  prosecution,  and  that 
they  might  also  visit  the  prisoner.  To  the  first  re- 
quest, the  Cardinal  had  replied  by  a  positive  refusal. 
It  is  impossible  to  pass  over  such  an  act  in  silence. 
What  excuse  will  the  advocates  of  the  Papal  Gov- 
ernment in  England  find  for  such  conduct?  It 
proves  that  a  Roman  Cardinal,  in  the  nineteenth 
century,  could  behave    more  unjustly   and   heart- 


DOCUMIim  RRrUSlD— INTBKVIBW  WITH  PRIBONBR  ASKRD.   95 

lessly*  than  did  a  Roman  Governor,  ignorant  of 
Christianity,  eighteen  hundred  years  ago !  "  I 
have  brought  him  forth  before  you,  O  King 
Ag^ppa,  that  after  examination  had,  I  might  have 
somewhat  to  write.  For  it  seemetk  to  me  unreason- 
able to  tend  a  prisoner^  and  not  withal  to  signify 
the  crimes  laid  against  him."  (Acts  xxv.  26, 27.) 

To  the  second  request,  viz.,  for  leave  to 
see  the  prisoner.  Cardinal  Patrizj  replied,  that 
the  Pope  alone  could  authorise  it.  The  Gen- 
eral begged  Iiim  to  write  for  the  permission,  and 
personally  to  press  the  request.  Tlie  Vicar  merely 
replied,  "  he  would  write."  The  General  pressed 
him  again  to  become  himself  the  advocate  of  the 
request,  but  he  could  get  no  explicit  answer  from 
him.  Such  are  the  mercies  of  ecclesiastics  when 
in  possession  of  power  ! 

The  Cardinal  inquired  whether  our  friends  were 
not  sent  out  by  some  English  religious  society,  to 
which  the  General  replied  that  they  had  come  in 
the  simple  character  of  friends  of  Achilli. 

At  this  inteniew  with  the  General,  they  placed 
before  him  the  marriage  certificate  of  Dr.  Achilli, 
with  which  he  seemed  perfectly  satisfied.  "  We 
told  him,"  they  say  in  their  journal,  "  that  we  took 
upon  ourselves  the  entire  moral  responsibility  of 
supporting   Achilli — that  we  are  satisfied  that  he 


96  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

is  the  man  we  took  him  for,  and  that  the  affair 
of  the  marriage  has  in  nowise  diminished  our  con- 
fidence in  the  moral  purity  of  his  character."  In 
reply  to  the  General's  question  why  the  marriage 
had  been  kept  so  secret,  they  replied,  that  after 
seeing  the  prisoner,  they  would  be  better  able  to 
answer  the  inquiry ;  but  that  one  thing  was  evident, 
that  in  the  eyes  of  the  Court  of  Rome,  for  a  priest 
to  marry  was  a  heinous  crime,  and  that  would 
doubtless  lead  him  to  avoid  needless  publicity. 

They  informed  the  General  that  they  expected 
to  be  able  to  establish  that  some  Chasseurs  de  Vin- 
cennes  had  escorted  the  prisoner  to  the  Inquisition. 
The  General,  in  reply,  assured  them,  with  some 
warmth,  that  he  was  sure  that  it  was  not  so.  With 
regard  to  the  arrest  being  made  "  in  the  name  of 
the  French  Prefect,"  he  opposed  the  evidence  of  the 
agents  of  police, — the  very  men  accused  of  doing  it ! 
He  said,  that  in  France  people  often  cried  out 
against  the  agents  of  police,  but  he  had  always 
found  their  reports  justified  by  fact.  It  was 
replied,  that  there  was  every  difference  between 
France  and  Italy,  and  especially  between  the  police 
of  a  constitutional  country,  and  the  Sbirri  di 
Galanti,  acting  under  arbitrary  authority  of  the  most 
odious  character. 

The   result  has   proved  that  our   friends   were 


DR.VIAL  or  PRKNCH  PABTICIPATION  I.N  ABRBOT.  97 

right,  and  that  the  representative  of  France  was 
mi^iinformod  by  men  whose  character  is  pro- 
verbial in  Rome  as  a  disgrace  to  society.  These 
sbirri  are  now  known  to  have  been  escorted  by 
FriMich  soldiers  who  came  from  the  French  Prefec- 
ture. It  was  natural  that  under  these  circum- 
stances they  should  say  that  they  acted  with 
French  authority,  and  it  is  certain  that  they  did 
say  80. 

The  Greneral  then  told  our  friends  that  he  was 
going  the  next  day  to  Portici,  when  he  would 
addR'ss  tlie  Pope  himself  in  Achilli's  favour ;  that 
"nothing,  absolutely  nothing,*'  was  to  be  gained 
from  the  Cardinals  in  favour  of  the  crowds  of  persons 
arrested  without  sufficient  cause,  for  whom  he  was 
daily  engaged ;  and  that  he  much  feared  that  till 
the  Pope's  return  nothing  could  be  hoped. 

Our  friends  had  on  this  day  to  encounter  a 
•evere  ordeal  of  Christian  principle.  They  shall 
relate  it  in  the  words  of  their  own  journal : — 

Daring  the  day,  the  subject  of  comnvnig  some 
means  for  Achilli's  escape  was  discussed  between  us 
two.  After  our  visit  to  the  Castle,  we  felt  convinced 
that  it  would  bo  easy  to  get  our  friend  out,  if  the  Itiilian 
jailor,  who  keeps  the  keys  of  his  cell,  and  that  of  tlie 
building  where  it  is  situated,  were  inclined  to  help  our 
plan ;  and  we  were  also  impressed  with  the  belief  that 
a  little  money  might  gain  him  over.    These  reflections 

0 


98  I3IPRIS0NMEXT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

led  US  to  a  painful  internal  strug-gle :  tlie  temptation  was 
strong ;  and,  after  talking  over  the  matter  for  some  time, 
we  each,  in  private  prayer,  laid  the  matter  before  the 
Lord,  and  then  resumed  our  discussion.  We  could  not 
but  feel  that  bribery  was  the  real  name  of  the  act  we  had 
in  contemplation ;  but  still,  the  case  was  so  grave,  that  we 
could  not  lay  aside  this  almost  certain  chance  of  saving 
our  brother,  without  scrutinising  to  the  very  bottom  its 
real  character.  We  came  to  the  conviction,  between  God 
and  ourselves,  that  the  proposed  means  would  be  sinful, 
because  it  would  involve  the  violation,  for  the  love  of 
money,  of  a  man's  conscience;  and  we  then  dismissed, 
once  for  all,  from  our  minds,  an  idea  which  so  many  con- 
tending feelings  seemed  at  first  to  justify  in  our  eyes. 
The  object  to  be  gained  was  the  safety  of  our  friend,  so 
iniquitously  imprisoned.  But  he  must  only  be  rescued 
by  means  worthy  of  that  Gospel  for  which  he  suffers ! 
This  truth  is  clearer  than  ever  to  our  eyes  after  the 
struggle  ;  and,  moreover,  we  are  persuaded  that  he  would 
himself  refuse  to  escape  from  his  lot,  however  cruel  it 
might  be,  by  means  which  could  not  be  openly  avowed. 
We  place  ourselves,  therefore,  and  liim,  in  our  Father's 
hands ;  at  the  same  time,  should  we  see  other  means  of 
effecting  his  escape,  we  shall  gladly  avail  ourselves  of  them. 

Every  Christian  conscience  will  respond  to  the 
sentiments  of  this  passage ! 

Wednesday,  Nov.  28, — Mr.  Tonna  waited  on 
Mr.  Petre,  98,  Via  de  Carrozze.  This  gentleman 
occupies  a  curious  office  or  post,  created  by  the 
British  Government ;  nominally  attached  to  the 
British  Embassy  at  Florence,  but  virtually  the 
embodiment    of  our   diplomacy    at   the    Court   of 


POSSIBIUTT  or  leOAPR-BRITISn  DIPLOMACY  IN  ROMB.     99 

Rome,  with  a  salary  of  about   £400  a-year.     On 
the  death  of  Mr.  Aubyn,  the  last  occupant,  Lord 
Aberdeen  (at  that  time  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs) 
is  said  to  have  received  a  multitude  of  applications 
from  artists  at  Rome   and  country  gentlemen  in 
England,  and  persons  of  every   grade  and  char- 
acter.    While  in  considerable  anxiety  to  make  the 
best  selection,  Mr.   Petre  was  named  to  him,  and 
was  immediately   appointed, — a    Roman    Catholic 
gentleman,  who  had  been  educated  at  the  Jesuit 
College  at  Stoncyhurst,  in  Lancasliire,  and  had  long 
resided    in    Rome.      The    operation    of    such   an 
appointment  may  be  taken  as  illustrative  of  the  way 
in  which  an  open  and  avowed  English  Embassy  at 
Rome  would  work.     The  principle  on  which  Mr. 
Petre  ?ras  selected  would  no  doubt  be  tlie  principle 
on  which  an  ambassador  would  be  selected — concilia- 
tion to  the  Pope.     We  shall  see  how  far,  in  the  present 
case,  that  thoroughgoing  love  of  liberty,  which,  thank 
God !  characterises  England,  has  or  has  not  been 
represented  at  Rome. 

Mr.  Tonna  gave  Mr.  Petre  the  history  of  the 
whole  afiair  of  Dr.  Achilli,  including  a  sketch  of 
his  history,  and  then  proceeded  to  ask  the  exercise 
of  Mr.  Petn'*.H  good  offices  with  the  Roman  author- 
ilifs.  He  pointed  out  the  impolicy  of  any  vindic- 
tive proceedings  against  a  man  so  generally  known, 

o2 


100  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHELLI. 

and  whose  case  was  taken  up  by  thousands ;  that 
when  Protestant  writers  and  speakers  accused  the 
Church  of  Rome  of  holding  persecuting  tenets,  they 
were  always  met  by  the  assertion  that  religious  perse- 
cution had  been  the  sin  of  imperfect  civilisation  and 
enlightenment,  and  that  nothing  of  the  sort  was, 
or  could  be,  practised  now.  If  Dr.  Achilli  lost 
his  liberty,  and  perhaps  his  life,  for  conscience'  sake, 
what  would  the  world  say  ? 

Tlie  conversation  which  followed  I  feel  myself 
justified  in  publishing,  a  diplomatist  being  a  public 
servant,  and  responsible  to  the  public  for  the  per- 
formance of  his  duties.  He  was  waited  upon  offi- 
cially, and  official  conversations  are  not  confidential, 
unless  it  be  so  agreed  at  the  time.  I  have  sub- 
mitted the  proofs  of  those  pages  to  Mr.  Tonna,  and 
if  either  he  or  myself  have  involuntarily  misrepre- 
sented Mr.  Petre,  I  undertake  to  insert  a  fly-leaf, 
containing  any  communication  which  that  gentle- 
man may  think  fit  to  send  to  me  for  that  purpose. 

Mr.  Petre  replied,  that  for  a  long  period,  no 
layman  had  ever  been  touched  by  the  Inquisition ; 
but  that  Achilli's  case  was  very  different ;  he  was  a 
Roman  subject,  a  Roman  priest,  and,  what  rendered 
the  case  still  more  complicated  and  grave,  he  was  a 
iriar. 

Mr.  Tonna  replied  that  that  was  not  the  case ; 


OOMMUXICATIOKS  WTTB  Ml.  FRBB.  101 

that  before  he  had  quitted  the  Church  of  Rome,  he 
had  applied  for  and  obtained  from  the  late  Pope  his 
si&gt;cularizatiou. 

Mr.  Petre  seemed  struck  by  this  remark,  but 
added,  that  it  did  not  alter  the  fact  of  his  being  a 
Roman  and  a  priest. 

Mr.  Tonna  said  that  he  was  quite  aware  of  this, 
and  that,  indeed,  as  to  the  &amp;ct  of  his  apostacy,  in 
the  eves  of  the  Church  of  Rome,  it  was  one  to  which 

ml  ' 

Achilli  himself  pleaded  guilty,  and  did  not  attempt 
or  wish  to  deny  it ;  but  still,  was  it  wise  or  prudent 
to  punish  him  simply  for  following  the  dictates  of 
his  eonscience  ?  And  again  asked  Mr.  Petre  to 
use  his  good  offices  in  his  behalf. 

Before  giving  any  answer  to  this,  Mr.  Petre 
said  he  must  ascertain  distinctly,  from  the  Roman 
authorities,  of  what  he  was  accused. 

Mr.  Tonna  alluded  to  the  criminal  accusations 
brought  against  him,  and  pointed  out  their  absurdity 
and  fidsenesB. 

Mr.  Petre  replied,  that  at  the  time  when  first 
inquiries  were  made  from  Paris,  persons  quite  hostile 
to  Achilli  had  told  him  that  such  reports  were  cur- 
rent, but  were  not  believed  by  any  one,  and  were 
never  advanced  by  the  Roman  authorities,  who 
arrested  him  simply  on  religious  grounds. 

Mr.  Tonna  asked  Mr.  Petre  to  endeavour  to 


102  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

gain  permission  for  an  interview  with  the  prisoner, 
and  pointed  out  the  grievous  cruelty  of  keeping 
him  in  secret  confinement  for  four  months,  without 
examining  him,  or  even  informing  him  of  what  he 
was  accused.  Mr.  Petre  repHed  that  this  was  the 
case  in  all  the  Roman  tribunals,  civil  as  well  as 
ecclesiastical.  That  if  a  man  were  even  to  murder 
a  priest,  he  might  be  kept  for  a  twelvemonth  before 
he  was  tried.  Mr.  Petre  would  make  inquiries  at  the 
Foreign  Office,  but  that  with  regard  to  seeing  him, 
he  knew  such  a  permission  was  difficult  to  obtain. 

Mr.  Tonna  again  asked  whether  he  might 
depend  upon  his  good  offices  in  this  matter,  but  Mr. 
Petre  said  he  could  give  no  answer  until  he  knew 
distinctly  what  the  Roman  Government  had  to  say, 
and  that  he  feared  he  could  do  little  more  than 
make  inquiries. 

Mr.  Tonna  again  pressed  on  Mr.  Petre,  and 
begged  him  to  point  out  to  the  Cardinals  the  im- 
policy of  touching  such  a  man,  whose  case  was  so 
warmly  taken  up,  and  for  whose  deliverance  prayers 
were  publicly  offered,  both  in  the  Established 
churches  and  in  Dissenting  chapels. 

Mr.  Petre  pointed  out,  that  if  an  exception 
were  made  in  Dr.  Achilli's  favour,  other  priests 
would  claim  similar  leniency,  and  the  Court  of 
Home  would  he  constantly  besieged  by  applications 


REFUSAL  OP  PIUS  UL  TO  PB&amp;MIT  I1«TBRYIBW.  103 

from  other  maiiomt,  whenever  the  discipline  of  the 
Church  rendered  it  necestary  to  be  active  against  a 
priest* 

Mr.  Toima  suggested  tliat  there  must  be  ways 
in  whicli  the  present  most  peculiar  case  might  be 
disposed  of,  witliout  affecting  the  general  question. 

Mr.  Petre  promised  to  inquire  into  the  accusa- 
tions, and  tlie  interview  terminated. 

Friday,  Nov.  30. — Our  friends  waited  on  Mr. 
Freeborn,  who  described  to  them  his  interview 
yesterday  with  the  Cardinal  Vicar  of  Rome  (Patrizj). 
The  result  was,  that  the  Cardinal  stated,  that  he  had 
received  from  the  Pope  a  negative  to  tlie  request  tliat 
they  might  see  Dr.  AchilU  in  his  prison.  Let  it  be 
borne  in  mind,  that  these  gentlemen  had  crossed 
Europe  to  defend  their  friend  and  brotlier  against  a 
cliarge  of  murder ;  and  that  the  Pope  is  the  person 
whose  tenderness  of  character  has  been  the  subject 
of  so  many  praises,  and  the  foundation  of  so  many 
pleas  for  sympathy  towards  liimself ! 

Saturday,  Dec.  1. — Mr.  Tonna  called  on  Mr. 
Petre.  The  latter  had  seen  the  Abbe  Gxudi,  Chef 
du  Bureau  des  AH'aircs  Etrang^res,  something  equi- 
valent to  our  Under  Secretary  of  State.     He  had

learnt  that  some  accusations  of  a  trifling  nature  had 
been  brought  against  Dr.  Achilli,  but  the  Govern- 
ment had  dismissed  them.  Tkei/  had  also  dismissed 
all  political  charges  against  him,  and  he  was  only 
charged  with  offences  against  religion  and  morality 
(the  latter  relating  to  his  marriage  during  the  Re- 
public). The  authorities  were  determined  to  allow  no 
interference  by  foreign  powers  on  this  or  such-like 
matters.  The  affair  was  in  the  hands  of  the  Holy 
Office,  and  the  Process,  or  secret  trial,  was  on  the 
point  of  being  finished,  when  judgment  would  be 
pronounced  and  carried  into  effect.  For  his  friends 
to  see  Dr.  Achilli,  was  a  thing  quite  out  of  the  ques- 
tion. M.  de  Corcelles,  the  former  French  Ambassa- 
dor, had  interested  himself  in  his  favour ;  but,  on 
being  shown  the  complesso,  or  abstract  of  accusations, 
he  had  declined  doing  anything  further. 

Mr.  Tonna  took  his  leave,  after  some  observa- 
tions on  the  cruelty  and  iniquity  of  the  whole  case, 
to  which  Mr,  Petre  made  no  reply. 

On  this  interview,  it  is  impossible  not  to  make 
this  remark.  If  M.  de  Corcelles  was  shown,  as  the 
Abbe  Guidi  states,  the  complesso,  in  which  Dr. 
Achilli  was  accused  of  heresy,  and  not  of  murder, 
how  did  it  happen  that,  for  the  three  months  of 
August,  September,  and  October,  the  French  agents 
in  Rome  continued  sending  despatches  to  the  Foreign 


COMMUNICATIONS  WITU  MR.  PBTRB.  105 

Office  in  PariSt  in  which  Dr.  Achilli  was  accused 
of  murder,  and  not  of  heresy  ? 

The  same  afternoon,  our  friends  called  on  M. 
de  la  Tour  d*Auvergne,  Secretary  of  the  French 
Embassy,  to  whom  they  had  letters  from  Greneral 
Oudinot,  and  found  him  at  his  private  house 
in  the  Piazza  de  Spagna.  They  represented 
to  him  the  anxiety  felt  by  Achilli's  friends  lest 
he  should  be  carried  off*  to  the  Castle  of  Ergas- 
toli,  or  to  some  place  garrisoned  by  Austrians. 
They  requested  M.  de  la  Tour  d'Auvergne  to 
protect  him  from  this,  reminding  liim  of  the  orders 
sent  by  the  Odillon  Barrot  Cabinet,  to  forbid 
Acliilli  being  removed  from  the  Castle  of  St. 
Angelo.  He  replied  that  no  such  order  had  been 
received. 

If  this  gentleman  was  ignorant,  as  we  are  bound 
to  believe,  of  the  order  referred  to,  it  follows  that 
M.  de  Corcelles,  the  French  Ambassador,  had  not 
allowed  the  Secretary  of  his  own  Embassy  to 
know  the  instructions  of  their  common  Govern- 
ment. Greneral  Rulhieres  distinctly  stated  to  the 
Deputation,  when  in  Paris,  that  such  orders  had 
been  sent  from  the  War  Office ;  and  it  is,  moreover, 
a  fact,  that  the  copy  of  the  despatch  of  M.  de 
Tocqueville,  then  Foreign  Minister,  containing  the 
same  orders,    is  at   this  moment    in   the    Foreign 


106  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

Office,  at  Paris,  where  it  has  recently  been  seen  and 
examined. 

The  same  day,  Saturday,  December  1,  our  friends 
made  a  communication  to  General  Baraguey  d'Hil- 
liers,  at  Portici.  To  explain  it,  it  will  be  necessary 
to  state  what  had  previously  occurred.  For  several 
days  past  they  had  been  busy  in  ascertaining  the 
particulars  of  the  arrest,  and  it  has  been  thought  that 
a  clearer  view  of  the  steps  taken  by  them  would 
be  given  by  relating  them  all  together,  than  by 
stating  them  each  day  as  they  occurred. 

About  a  week  before,  the  following  memorandum 
was  put  into  their  hands,  written  by  a  person  who 
lodged  in  the  Palazzetto  Borghese  : — 

Near  midnight  of  the  29th  July,  Signer  Giacinto 
Achilli  was  arrested,  and  carried  off  by  six  Chasseurs 
d'Orleans,  and  a  Corporal.  M.  de  Sant,  an  officer  of  the 
4th  Company  of  the  25th  Eegiment,  and  Grondon,  Adju- 
tant of  the  same  regiment,  were  witnesses  of  this  event, 
which  took  place  in  the  Palazzo  della  Famiglia  Borghese. 
These  gentlemen  will  be  able  to  give  the  name  of  the 
Corporal,  as  they  conversed  with  him  while  the  sbirri  went 
up  to  Achilli's  apartments. 

M.  Meyrueis  immediately  set  out,  late  at  night,  in 
search  of  these  officers,  and  found  in  the  Piazza 
Borghese  some  soldiers  of  the  25th  Regiment ;  by 
whom  he  was  told  that  the  correct  names  of  these 
officers  must  be  Adjutant  Gandon  (not  Grondon), 


FRRNOU  (XM)P8RATI0N  IN  ABOEST  SUOOSSTBD.  107 

and  Sergeant-major  Desaint  (not  do  Sant).  M. 
(randon  being  at  the  theatre,  M.  Meynieis  was 
unable  to  find  him  that  night. 

The  next  day,  M.  Meynieis  went  to  the  street 
wliere  the  Voltigeurs,  or  light  company,  of  the  25th 
Light  Infantry  are  quartered,  and  there  he  found 
Sergeant-major  Desaint.  He  explained  to  him 
the  object  of  liis  visit,  but  he  replied  that  he  had  no 
recollection  of  such  an  occurrence  on  the  29th  July. 
Adjutant  Gandon  being  then  engaged  with  the  whole 
of  the  ofiicers  and  non-commissioned  officers,  our 
friend  did  not  wish  to  speak  to  him  before  them,  and 
therefore  begged  him  to  fix  a  time  to  see  him,  which 
he  did.  At  the  hour  appointed,  the  Adjutant  met  him. 
He  told  him  that  a  friend  of  his  had  been  arrested 
under  such  and  such  circumstances,  and  that,  having 
heard  he  had  \)een  on  the  spot,  he  begged  him  to 
tell  him  all  the  particulars.  "Your  company,"  he 
added,  "  was  quartered  in  the  Palazzetto  Borghese, 
and  you  were  supping  in  the  porter's  lodge  with 
Sergeant-major  Desaint." 

•  ^  - "  he  said,  "not  Desaint;  but  Sub- 
lieutLiiaiii  Deschamps.  1  remember  the  circum- 
stance very  well.  It  was  a  young  man  who  was 
arrested  while  in  be&lt;l  witlj  his  wife.  He  is  married, 
is  he  not  ?" 

"  He  is." 


108  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

The  Adjutant  then  proceeded  to  relate  particulars 
of  the  arrest,  as  they  are  detailed  in  Mr.  Tonna's 
report  of  December  17.  He  said  that  when  the 
Commanding  Officer  stopped  the  Voltigeurs  of  the 
25th  from  interfering,  the  latter  were  beginning  to 
be  much  excited.  "  Ah,"  he  added,  "  the  Volti- 
geurs would  soon  have  strangled  them  !" 

Adjutant  Gandon  said  that  he  should  know  the 
Corporal  of  the  Chasseurs  de  Vincennes  if  he  saw 
him  again,  and  that  they  should  be  able  to  find 
him  out  by  the  day-book,  the  registre  de  service,  of 
his  regiment. 

The  same  afternoon,  the  Adjutant,  with  great 
kindness  and  cordiality,  met  M.  Meyrueis  again,  by 
appointment,  and  took  him  to  the  Adjutant  of  the 
2nd  Battalion  of  the  Chasseurs  de  Vincennes,  on  the 
Corso,  opposite  the  Palazzo  Simonetti.  The  Adju- 
tant of  the  Chasseurs  remarked  that  the  date  about 
which  they  inquired  was  an  old  one,  July  29 ;  but 
he  would  examine  the  cahiers  de  service.  He 
took  out  the  oldest  (they  are  not  necessarily  pre- 
served), and  found  that  it  began  on  August  1  ! 

M.  Meyrueis  and  M.  Gandon  then  went  to  the 
quarters  of  the  1st  Battalion  of  the  same  regiment 
(Chasseurs  de  Vincennes).  There,  however,  they 
ascertained  from  some  of  the  non-commissioned 
officers,  that   on  the   29th  of  July  their  battalion

had  not  coinmenrtMl  mounting  g:»ard  at  the  PoUcp.

room  ot"  tin-  Police-office  itself,  where  the  cahiers 
de  service  only  hegaii  on  Octol)er  1.  They  then 
went  to  La  Place  (the  head-quarters  of  the  town), 
where  they  vainly  endeavoured  to  get  information. 

M.  Meyi  11.  i-  then  returned  to  the  Adjutant  of  the 
•Jnd  Battalion,  who  had  succeeded  in  discovering  an- 
other ciih'icr  of  tlie  month  of  July.  As  he  turned  over 
the  leaves,  M.  Mejnnieis  eagerly  followed  him  with 
his  eyes;  July  12— 18— 20— 22— and  then— all 
the  papfcs  were  hlank !  The  book  previously  ex- 
aniiued  did  not  go  back  before  August  1 ;  this 
did  not  continue  beyond  July  22.  July  29  was  not 
to  he  traced  !     This  was  a  great  trial  of  faith. 

Ih.  n.  xt  day,  M.  Meyrueis  called  again  on  the 
same  Adjutant.  From  inquiry  among  the  non- 
commissioned officers,  it  had  resulted  that  Roger 
was  the  sergeant  on  duty  on  the  night  of  July  29. 
Roger  was  called  in,  and  perfectly  remembered  that 
lie  was  on  duty  on  the  first  Sunday  night  after  his 
return  from  duty  in  tiie  country  in  July.  It  ap- 
peared that  Ik  !•(  turned  to  Rome  on  Monday, 
July  2.*i ;  (  &gt;u-«  (|ut  iiily,  he  was  on  duty  at  the 
Frf'nrli  l'oHc«-oHic. ,  in  Rome,  on  Sunday  night,

rtcullccttd    that    on    that  nujht    many  arrests   had

taken  place ;  so  much  so,  that  his  post  had  been 
almost  empty,  so  many  parties  had  been  called  out. 

Our  friends  gratefully  recognised  the  hand  of 
Providence  in  helping  them  to  find  the  Sergeant  on 
duty,  on  July  29.  By  his  statements  their  case 
was  virtually  proved,  even  if  they  could  learn  no 
more  about  the  identical  Corporal. 

At  one  time,  the  non-commissioned  officers,  who 
took  great  pains  on  the  subject,  thought  they  had 
found  the  Corporal.  The  man  in  question  remem- 
bered making  an  arrest  that  night,  near  the  Piazza 
Borghese,  but  did  not  recollect  that  it  was  in  a  palace 
where  the  Voltigeurs  of  the  25th  were  quartered.  M. 
Meyrueis  requested  him  to  accompany  him  to  Adju- 
tant Gandon,  of  the  25th ;  but  they  did  not  recognise 
each  other.  He  then  took  him  to  the  Palazetto 
Borghese,  but  the  Corporal  at  once  said  that  he  was 
sure  that  he  had  aiTested  no  one  there.  On  their  way 
back,  he  stopped  at  a  comer  of  the  Piazza  Borghese, 
and,  pointing  to  a  tall  house  down  a  street,  said  that 
that  was  the  house,  at  the  third  floor,  &amp;c.,  &amp;c., 
where  he  had  arrested  the  man.  So  that  it  was 
clear  that  he  was  not  the  Corporal  who  arrested 
Achilli.  M.  Meyrueis  saw  other  Corporals  who  had 
been  on  duty  the  same  night ;  but  they  had  arrested 
so  many  people,  and  it  was  now  so  many  months  ago, 
that  they  could  not  recollect  particulars.

Enougli,  however,  had  been  learnt.  Two  officers 
bearin":  the  commission  of  the  Republic  had  been 
1 'uud,  who  deposed  to  the  co-o|)erdtion  of  a 
detachment  of  Chasseurs  de  \  incinnes  in  our 
friend's  arrest.  The  Sergeant  of  the  night  had 
been  found,  who  deposed  to  his  men  being  en- 
gaged all  that  night  in  making  arrests.  Some 
of  them  effected  an  arrest  within  gunshot  of  the 
spot  where  Dr.  Achilli  was  seized.  Probably  the 
French  authorities  in  Rome  now  know  the  names 
of  the  actual  Corporal  and  soldiers  who  escorted 
Dr.  Achilli.  But  whether  they  do  so  or  not, 
they  have  received  evidence  to  prove  the  French 
rc&gt;[)onsibility. 

On  Saturday,  December  1,  as  has  been  stated,* 
Mr.  Tonna  and  M.  Meyrueis  wrote  a  letter  to  General 
Baragney  d'Hilliers  at  Portici,  which  is  subjoined. 
They  posted  it  themselves  at  the  General  Post- 
office,  under  cover  to  Mr.  Temple,  British  Ambas- 
sador at  the  Court  of  Naples.

QI5BRAL, 

Daring  the  visit,  which  we  had  the  honour  to  make 
to  you  the  day  before  our  departure  from  Rome,  we 
gave  yoa  the  French  translation  of  a  declaration,  writ- 
ten by  Dr.  Acbilli's  brother  and  sister-in-law,  in  which 

*  ViMr  page  100. 


112  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

the  principal  circumstances  of  our  friend's  arrest  were 
related,  and  which,  in  particular,  affirmed  that  that  arrest 
had  been  made  in  the  name  of  the  French  Prefect  of 
Police.  Your  Excellency  answered  us  that  you  were  cer- 
tain of  the  contrary,  from  the  testimony  of  the  agents  of 
the  police  themselves,  which  testimony,  in  your  eyes,  was 
preferable  to  that  which  we  brought  forward. 

We  also  said  that  we  had  strong  reasons  for  thinking 
that  some  Chasseurs  de  Vincennes  had  assisted  in  the 
arrest.  Your  Excellency  told  us  that  the  inquiries  that 
you  had  made  allowed  you  formally  to  deny  this  fact. 

Nevertheless,  General,  we  are  able  now  to  bring  forward 
the  testimony  of  two  French  officers,  who  were  present  at 
the  arrest,  being  then  quartered  with  part  of  their  battalion 
in  the  Palazzetto  Borghese  itself,  and  happening  to  come 
in  at  the  moment  when  the  agents  of  Police  amved,  sup- 
ported by  a  detachment  of  the  "  Chasseurs  de  Vincennes," 
having  at  their  head  a  corporal,  with  whom  these  two 
officers  entered  into  conversation.  They  were  MM. 
Gaudon,  Adjutant,  and  Deschamps,  Sub-lieutenant,  of  the 
2nd  Battalion  of  the  25th  Light  Infantry.  M.  Meyrueis 
has  just  returned  from  seeing  them,  and  has  received 
details  from  them  which  are  too  long  to  be  here  told. 
Tliis  French  troop,  which  was,  and  still  is,  on  duty  at  the 
Prefecture  of  Police,  has  thus  been  made  use  of  to  arrest 
our  friend,  in  a  palace  which  had  for  the  time  become  a 
French  barrack,  and  to  conduct  him,  where  ?  This  we  shall, 
no  doubt,  know. 

In  the  meantime,  is  it  possible  to  separate  the 
action  of  a  French  troop  from  that  of  the  French  Prefect 
of  Police,  at  whose  office  this  troop  is  on  duty,  especially 
when  it  only  acts,  as  we  know,  upon  orders  given 
in  the  French  language,  and  proceeding  from  the 
Prefecture?  What  will  any  honest  man  think  on  this 
point;  what  will  all  Europe  think  of  it;  above  all,  what 
will  your  Excellency  think  of  it  ?    This  question,  General, 


I 


UmiR  TO  OINIRAL  SARAGUBY  D'lIILLIBRS.  113 

it  ig  not  for  lu  to  answer.  Our  two  first  witnesses  were 
n^^pcctable  ;  we  will  not  speak  of  the  declaration  made  by 
the  prisoner  himself.  Those  which  we  bring  forward  now 
wear  the  epaulettes  of  your  army,  and  have  even  received 
them  isince  the  period  of  which  we  now  speak. 

We  mu?t  leave  your  Excellency  to  judge  as  to  what 
initiative  such  facts  will  allow  you  to  take  in  a  question  of 
humanity,  for  which  you  have  manifested,  from  the  first, 
such  generous  and  sincere  sympathy. 

Your  good  faith  has  been  shamefully  deceived  by 
unprincipled  men ;  our  task  was  to  undeceive  you,  and 
we  have  done  so. 

Allow  us,  General,  to  express  to  you  again  our  reliance 
on  your  good  wishes,  and  on  your  authority,  as  well  as 
our  feelings  of  high  consideration.

LEWIS  H.  J.  TONNA. 

Sunday,  Dec.  2. — This  day  a  good  deal  of  liglit 
was  thrown  on  the  participation  of  French  troops  in 
the  arrest.  Tlie  following  extracts  from  our  friends' 
journal  contain  facts  derived  from  an  undoubted 
source: — 

The  French  Prefect  of  Police,  a  chef  de  hataiUon,  an 
amiable  and  respectable  man,  is  tired  and  disgusted  with  the 
part  he  is  made  to  play.  We  learned  from  our  informant 
tiiut  he  declares  he  has  not  signed  a  single  warrant  for  an 
arrest,  but  does  not  interfere  with  his  subordinates.  One 
of  these,  a  Frenchman,  M.  Mangnin,  is  the  son,  if  we 
remember  right,  of  the  Prefet  de  Police  in  Paris,  at 
the  downfall  of  Charles.  The  other  subordinate  of  the 
rr&gt;  feet  is  an  old  employ i  in  the  Gregorian  police.  His 
otiicial  title  we  do  not  know,  but  he  is  the  real  Perfect  of 

u 


114  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;C.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

Police,  and  is,  in  fact,  Governor  of  Eome,  to  use  the 
expression  of  our  informant.  His  name  is  Benvenuti,  a 
hard,  inflexible  man,  who  has  abused  the  Prefect's  name 
and  signature.  The  Prefect,  it  is  said,  has  had  some 
altercations  with  him,  and  even  threatened  to  arrest  him  ; 
to  which  he  is  said  to  have  replied,  "  If  you  put  me 
in  the  Castle  of  St.  Angelo,  the  Cardinals  themselves  will 
come  and  take  me  out."  It  is  difficult  to  understand  how 
M.  Eouxeau  can  put  up  with  such  a  position,  as  he  shares 
the  indignation  which  is  felt  by  the  City  and  the  Army  at 
the  daily  proceedings. 

You  will  remember  we  have  been  told  that  the  French 
Prefect  had  nothing  to  do  with  Achilli's  arrest.  In 
answer  to  our  positive  assertion  to  the  contrary,  M. 
de  Corcelles  has  said  that  the  Prefect  had  told  him 
that  no  trace  of  Achilli's  arrest  appeared  in  his 
"Registres  matricules"*  (see  page  84).  From  what 
we  hear  to-day,  we  can  believe  this  statement,  since  the 
Prefect,  it  now  appears,  allows  an  anonymous,  arbitrary, 
and  inquisitorial  police,  the  police  of  the  priests,  to  act 
covered  with  his  responsibility,  and  supported  by  the 
gallant  bayonets  of  Vincennes.  Even  if  it  be  attempted 
to  deny  the  responsibility,  can  one  deny  that  his  office  is  the 
source  from  whence  these  odious  proceedings  emanate  ?" 

Monday,  Dec.  3. — Mr.  Tonna  being  compelled 
to-day  to  return  to  England,  our  friends  went  to- 
gether to  the  Castle  of  St.  Angelo,  to  receive  from 
Capt.  Gennari  Dr.  Achilli's  receipt  for  a  small  sum  of 
money  they  had  left  for  him.     They  ascended  the 


*  Registres  matricules  mean  forms  taken  out  of  a  book  (as  a  check 
is  taken  from  a  banker's  book),  leaving:  behind  what  either  is  the 
exact  duplicate  (matrix),  or  states  the  same  facts  brietiy.

long  staircase  previously  descrilHtl.  1  lie  j^mting  was 
o|&gt;ened  by  a  French  (inimdicr,  wlio  at  their  request 
rang  tlie  bell  for  the  lloniiui  gaoler.  Two  gentle- 
men were  walking  up  and  down  the  court  within 
the  grating. 

Tlie  gaoler  came  down,  and  they  asked  him  for 
news  of  Achilli.  Before  he  could  answer,  one  of 
the  two  gentlemen,  who  overheard,  exclaimed, 
"  Achilli,  oh,  he  is  very  well ;  I  have  been  his 
fellow-prisoner  for  twenty  days.  I  was  arrested  for 
a  public  occurrence  in  Rome,  on  a  day  when  I  was 
away  from  the  city  altogether." 

Tlie  gaoler  confirmed  the  statement  about 
Achilli*s  health.  He  offered  to  take  up  their  cards 
to  him,  and  to  bring  tliem  back  a  word  in  reply. 
Tliis  man  assured  them  that  he  was  most  kindly 
disposed  towards  our  friend ;  and  this  spontaneous 
offer,  as  well  as  the  tone  of  his  voice  and  the  ex- 
pression of  his  face,  gave  an  assurance  that  this 
was  really  the  case.  While  he  was  gone  to  the 
prisoners*  cells,  Acliilli*s  fellow- prisoner,  who  is 
kept,  not  in  tegreta^  but  alia  larga,  and  is  therefore 
allowed  to  walk  in  the  court,  told  us  that  Achilli 
was  perfectly  calm,  confident  that  no  crime  could  be 
laid  to  bis  charge ;  that  up  to  this  time  he  had  under- 
gone no  examination  (comjiare  this  fact  with  iMr. 
Ttt re's  statement,  |&gt;age  102),  and  that  his  coni|&gt;:inionfl

in  misfortune,  Colonel  Calandrelli  and  a  Republican 
priest,  and  others,  were  in  the  same  position.  "  Siamo 
rovinati,"  he  added,  speaking  of  his  country. 

Mr.  Tonna  had  intimated  in  the  card  he  had 
sent  to  Achilli  that  he  was  about  to  leave  Rome;  he 
sent  a  message  back,  asking  him  to  try  and  stay 
some  days  longer,  and  sent  his  love  to  them.  They 
then  left  the  Castle.  No  means  of  getting  the 
Pope's  permission  to  see  him,  and  no  means  of 
seeing  him  without  it !  During  the  day  a  note  was 
brought  to  our  friends  from  Achilli.  "  We  make," 
says  the  journal,  "  no  comment  upon  it ;  our  friends 
will  be  able  to  appreciate  its  spirit !"  It  is  sub- 
joined : — 

Dec.  3,  1849. 
My  dear  Friends, 

Your  coming  is  a  great  comfort  to  me.  I  have  heard 
how  much  our  good  brethren  have  exerted  themselves  on 
my  behalf.  For  which  cause  I  thank  the  Lord,  inasmuch 
as  my  faith  is  strengthened  by  their  and  your  kindness 
towards  me.  I  was  told  of  your  Adsit  directly  through 
the  kindness  of  that  good  old  man  to  whom  you  gave  your 
names.  Oh,  how  I  should  have  liked  to  embrace  you, 
and  all  three  to  bless  the  Lord  in  this  place,  wliere  He 
Himself  has  allowed  me  to  be  brought,  for  reasons  which 
are  known  to  Him  alone,  and  where  also  I  liave  had  so 
many  consolations,  which  I  will  tell  you  of  when  I  shall 
have  the  liappiness  of  seeing  you  again.  Oh,  how  good 
the  Lord  is !  My  tribulation  has,  thanks  to  Him,  so 
many  and  so  great  compensations,  that  my  enjoyment

tnrptsMt  Vkj  lofferings,  aiiJ  I  have  only  to  thank  him  for 
all  that  He  does. 

My  dear  Brethren,  you  are  come  into  a  country  wliich 
now,  through  the  Divine  mercy,  begins  to  open  iia  eyes 
to  the  light  of  the  Truth ;  but  you  will  still  find  the  souls 
here  in  doubt  and  uncertainty.  But,  oh,  what  a  future 
preparing,  in  the  Providence  of  God!  I  more  than 
others  have  had  opportunity  hitherto  to  admire  the 
seerei  plans  of  that  beneficent  Hand  which  humbles 
the  people  and  raises  them  up  again  ;  prostrates  the 
nations  down  to  the  ground,  and  soon  raises  them  up 
to  the  akiM.  Toa  are  in  that  country,  where  now 
a  prodigy  ia  being  wrought,  which  is  the  work  of  the 
Lord.  Praiae  Him  who  is  walking  tlirough  these  regions  I 
Adore  the  decrees  of  His  knowledge  and  of  His  love  I  If 
He  graciously  permits  me  to  walk  with  you  in  this  place, 
I  shall  myself  be  able  to  show  you  the  traces  of  His  bene- 
fioenee.  In  the  meantime,  let  us  unite  our  prayers  at  the 
Throne  of  Grace,  because  He  is  able  to  raise  up,  even  out 
of  these  stones,  children  to  Abraham. 

I  am  in  very  good  health,  and  in  excellent  spirits, 
waiting  always  for  the  events  of  God's  Providence.  Greet 
our  brethren  from  me.  May  the  Lord  be  your  counsel 
and  your  help  in  all  which  you  propose  to  do  for  His 
C^ory.  May  the  Lord  permit  us  again  to  embrace  each 
otherl   Adieu. 

To  my  dear  friends,  Mr.  Tonna  and  M.  Mbtbubis. 

The  fame  day,  Mr.  Tonna  and  M.  Meyrueid 
completed  their  united  jounial,  and  the  former  left 
Rome  for  Civita  Veccliia,  from  whence  he  proceeded, 
hy  Pari«  (where  he  saw  Lord  Normanhy  and  the 
brethren  of  the  Alliance),  to  England.  A  few  days 
after  hia  arrival  he  wrote  the  following  letter.     It 


118  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

gives  several  details  which  have,  for  that  reason,  not 
been  inserted  in  the  foregoing  narrative : — 

L.  H.  J.  TOXNA,  ESQ.,  TO  SIR  CULLING  EARDLEY. 

London,  December  17,  1849. 

My  dear  Sir  Culling, 

I  thiuk  I  cannot  do  better  than  throw  into  the  form  of 
a  letter  to  you,  the  substance  of  the  information  I  have 
obtained,  with  my  friend  Mons.  Meyrueis,  respecting  Dr. 
Achilli. 

The  Eoman  Correspondent  of  the  Times  unreason- 
ably argues,  that  because  I  did  not  communicate  to  him 
the  result  of  my  researches,  these  researches  must  neces- 
sarily be  of  an  unfavourable  character.  I  had  other 
motives  for  not  wishing  to  avail  myself  of  that  gentleman's 
pen,  of  which,  I  regret  to  say,  he  makes  so  able  and  so 
dangerous  a  use.  His  confidence  in  his  own  special  sources 
of  information  may  be  great,  but  this  confidence  will  not 
long  be  shared  by  the  reading  public  in  England,  when 
they  find  that  he  was  led  to  give  currency,  in  the  columns 
of  the  Times,  to  so  absurd  a  story  as  the  assassination  of 
the  nun  at  Viterbo.  When  a  public  writer  circulates  a 
story  which  attacks  a  man's  character,  we  have  a  right  to 
expect  that  lie  has  well  tested  the  evidence  on  which  it 
rests ;  and  how  much  more  so,  when  the  life  and  liberty 
of  the  accused  are  at  stake,  and  he  a  helpless  captive,  for- 
bidden all  defence,  all  reply  !  ! 

In  the  Correspondent's  last  letter,  dated  4th  December, 
■he  states  that  these  charges  have  been  abandoned: 
the  fact  is,  and  it  is  important,  the  Government  say  that 
they  never  for  a  moment  entertained  them.  Mr.  Petre, 
Attache  to  the  Legation  at  Florence,  and  resident  at 
Rome^^ — a  Roman  Catholic  gentleman,  who  naturally 
looks  with  no  favour  on  an  apostate  priest — informed  me 
that  when  the  first  stir  was  made  in  England  and  France, 
persons  very  hostile  to  Achilli  informed  him  that  rumours 


MS.  TOX.f  A*8  BBTURN-BBrOBT-TnB  "  TIMBJJ.'  1 19 

of  this  kind  were  oarrent  in  Rome,  bnt  leere  not  Mimed 
k%f  amy  one.  The  Abb^  Goidi,  at  the  head  of  the  Bareaa 
des  Aflkires  Etrangidree,  states  that  some  charges  of  deiitli 
t4»na,  slight  erimee,  had  been  brought  against  him,  but 
abandmied  as  untenable — (would  the  seduction  and  murder 
of  a  nun  be  called  a  delitto  tenuof), — and  that  he  was 
cxclasively  attached  as  a  priest  who  had  apostatised  and 
contracted  marriage,  which,  of  course,  is  "  immorality"  in 
the  eyes  of  Rome.  Finally,  M.  de  Corcelles  informed  me,  in 
the  presence  of  General  Baraguey  dllilliers,  that  although 
some  "soMpfofis"  had  been  entertained  against  him,  of 
these  he  was  ab$out.  That  these  suspicions  were  evidently 
gfoandleM,  M.  de  Corcelles  himself  remarked,  from  the 
efareomatuiee  of  his  having  held  responsible  positions  in 
the  Choreh  after  he  quitted  Viterbo.  I  trust  the  Corres- 
pi&gt;ndeiit  of  the  Times  at  Rome  will  be  on  his  guard,  and 
not  henceforth  trust  any  "  inspiration  " — an  expression 
often  employed  by  him— of  the  nature  that  dictated  the 
Viterbo  story. 

With  rc^^ard  to  Viterbo,  I  may  here  mention,  that  no 
trace  or  shadow  of  such  a  story  is  to.  be  found  there.  It 
is  not  even  a  romance  founded  on  fact,  but  as  pure  a  fiction 
as  Orlando  Furioso.  To  use  the  expression  of  a  Roman 
lawyer,  the  whole  story  is  falsa  di  pianta — a  root  and 
branch  lie. 

Padre  Achilli  is  well  rcii  '  v&lt;lin  his  native  town,  and 
the  anger  which  some  of  th'  i  tints  feel  at  his  apostacy, 

has  not  efiMsed  from  their  minds  the  recollection  of  his 
unblemiahed  character,  his  sweet  and  engaging  manners, 
his  oommaading  talents,  his  open-handed  chanty.  They 
also  remember  hia  nnoompromising  firmness  in  resisting, 
as  soon  as  he  himself  came  to  a  position  of  intluence,  the 
abases  which  etisted  in  the  Dominican  convents.  The 
(^hurch  of  San  ICatteo  was  repaired  and  renovated  out  of 
the  Amds  which  he  rescued  from  being  squandered  in  the 
indulgence  and  ease  of  his  cloistered  brethren.    For  this 


120  IMPRISONMENT,  kc.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

he  was  extolled  by  all  Viterbo,  and  hated  by  the  friars ; 
and  thence  arose  the  "soupgons"  the  "delitti  tenui"  which 
were  endeavoured  to  be  raked  up  against  him.  A  story 
was  got  up  against  him  of  an  indiscretion.  It  was 
sent  up  to  Rome ;  treated  with  utter  contempt,  no  judicial 
proceedings  ever  took  place,  as  all  bore  witness  to  its 
being  a  calumny.  On  the  contrary,  he  was  promoted  at 
Viterbo  in  the  room  of  one  of  his  accusers ;  and  afterwards 
received  further  advancement  at  Rome  itself.  The  young 
woman  whom  they  endeavoured  to  slander  is  now  living 
at  Viterbo,  married,  the  mother  of  a  large  family,  and 
highly  respected;  she  speaks  of  Padre  Achilli  with  the 
utmost  gratitude  and  respect,  as  one  whose  Christian 
charity  had  helped  her  at  a  period  of  great  distress  and  trial. 

The  real  cause  which  led  him  at  an  early  age  to  enter 
the  Dominican  convent  is  not  indeed  without  a  touch  of 
romance,  but  of  a  sad  and  affecting  nature.  His  father 
died  young,  leaving  two  children,  Giacinto,  and  a  sister  a 
year  younger  than  himself — a  beautiful  girl,  who  had 
grown  up  with  him  in  the  tenderest  affection.  At  the  age 
of  fifteen,  she  died,  and  her  brother  was  for  some  time  in 
a  state  bordering  on  distraction.  The  poor  mother  never 
recovered  the  affliction,  but  followed  her  daughter  to  the 
grave  a  year  after ;  and  Giacinto  Achilli,  feeling  his  home 
desolate,  and  being  naturally  fond  of  study,  hastened  to 
fleek  for  comfort  in  the  recesses  of  the  cloister.  He 
found  it  for  a  time ;  for,  until  his  conscience  became  dis- 
turbed with  scruples  as  to  his  faith,  he  was  very  happy 
in  the  full  indulgence  of  literary  tastes.  It  is  interesting 
to  remark,  that  he  succeeded  in  founding  a  Professorship 
of  Sacred  Scripture  at  Viterbo,  and  was  himself  the  first 
to  fill  that  chair,  which  still  exists. 

His  subsequent  residence  at  Capua,  his  election  to  be 
Prior  of  his  convent,  his  gradual  discovery  that  the 
theology  he  was  teaching  was  false,  his  evangelical  preach- 
ing and  consequent  persecution  by  the  Inquisition,  his  flight

to  Corfu,  and  hia  spirited  and  able  I'ope  Gregory 

X\  I.  as  soon  as  ho  was  safe  umlcr  tiu;  l&gt;ritish  flag, — all 
these  are  well  known,  and  I  will  briedy  relate  the  circuui- 
stance  of  his  going  to  Rome,  and  of  his  snbsequcnt 
arrest. 

In  the  month  of  December,  1848,  he  met  me  in 
I»ndon,  with  a  countenance  full  of  joy,  saying, — "  Tho 
I'ope  has  quitted  Rome,  I  must  instantly  return  there 
bearing  the  Gospel  of  Jesus  Christ."  He  accordingly 
made  preparations  for  departure,  and  arrived  in  Rome 
early  in  February.  You  have  seen  all  the  letters  he  wrote 
during  his  sojourn  in  Rome.  The  information  I  have 
obtained  in  Rome  itself  confirms  minutely  all  that  he  related 
to  us.  He  distributed  the  Scriptures  widely,  and  invited 
iho^Q  to  whom  he  gave  them,  to  meet  him  again  ur  visit 
liini ;  and  his  house  was,  consequently,  so  constantly  filled 
with  inquirers,  that  he  often  found  little  time  for  his  meals, 
i^it  he  never  preached  in  public  (as  the  Roman  uiuhorities 
stated),  because,  acting  with  great  prudence,  he  determined 
to  follow  strictly  all  existing  laws,  and  he,  therefore, 
waited  for  the  actual  promulgation,  by  the  Constituent 
Assembly,  of  the  decree  granting  full  protection  to  all 
religions  opinions.  He  did  not  found  schools,  of  which 
t))oy  accuse  him,  simply  because  he  had  not  time  to  do  so. 
He  has  not  even  been  accused  of  meddling  with  politics ; 
I  need  not,  therefore,  allude  to  the  subject,  further  than  to 
say,  that  a  seat  in  the  Assembly  and  high  office  were  open 
to  him,  but  he  declined  it  all,  saying  he  had  another 
niiad&lt;m  to  aooomplish. 

On  the  24th  June,  he  was  marrit.Ml  to  the  daughter  of  a 
u  the  presence  of  the  little  Church  or 
company  of  t&gt;6lievers,  with  a  litnr}?ical  service,  and  agree- 
ably to  th«  laws  of  the  existing  Roman  Republic.  Tho 
ceremony  was  performed  by  a  converted  Roman  Catholic 
priest,  and  the  atto,  or  eertifioate  of  marriage,  bearing 
the  seal  of  the  oongr^gataon,  and  signed  by  the  contracting

parties,  the  minister,  and  the  witnesses,  has  been  deposited 
in  safe  hands.     I  have  seen  and  copied  the  document. 

On  the  15th  July,  the  French  entered  Eome,  and  it 
would  have  been  well  had  he  then  fled ;  but,  to  all  entreaties 
he  replied,  that  he  was  perfectly  guiltless,  and  that  where 
French  rule  existed,  it  was  impossible  for  him  to  be 
touched  merely  for  religion.  Other  parties  who  were 
daily  arrested  were  political  offenders,  but  he  considered 
liimself  quite  safe  until  the  arrival  of  the  Pope,  when,  of 
course,  he  must  quit  Eome. 

Now  for  the  circumstances  of  his  arrest;  but,  first,  let  me 
recall  to  your  mind  the  statements  which  have  been  made 
from  Eome  to  the  French  Government,  and  by  the  French 
Foreign  Office  have  been  frankly  communicated  to  yourself. 
"  Ni  la  force  militaire  Francaise,"  you  have  been  told,  "  ni 
les  deux  agens  Francais,  qui  participaient  sous  les  ordres  du 
Ministre  de  I'lnterieur  Komain  a  la  police  Romaine,  n'ont 
concouru  en  rien  a  Varrestation  du  Dr.  Achilli." 

This  statement  is  very  distinct  and  explicit.  Compare 
it  with  the  real  facts  of  the  case,  which  I  will  now  lay 
before  you.  Let  me  first  observe  that  the  use  of  the 
name  of  the  French  Prefect  is  attested  by  Madame 
Achilli,  whom  I  saw  at  Leghorn,  and  two  other  witnesses, 
as  well  as  by  the  prisoner  himself,  although  he  has  had 
no  communication  with  the  others.  The  fact  of  the 
military  escort  coming  from  the  Prefecture  is  witnessed 
by  two  French  officers  ;  and  ere  this,  I  doubt  not,  that  my 
friend  M.  Meyrueis  has  found  out  and  seen  the  very  Cor- 
poral who  headed  the  party,  and  from  him  some  valuable 
details  will  be  obtained. 

Immediately  opposite  to  the  splendid  Palace  of  the 
Borghesi,  in  the  Piazza  of  the  same  name,  stands  the 
Palazzctto  or  Palazzo  delta  famiglia  Borghese,  which,  in 
the  palmy  days  of  that  princely  house,  was  used  as  a  resi- 
dence for  their  numerous  retainers  and  domestics. '  A 
•gateway,  with  a  long  vaulted  passage,  leads  to  an  oblong

court  of  confliderablo  dimensions,  round  which  run  three 
tiers  of  wide  galleries,  supported  by  arches,  and  in  theso 
galleries  doors  and  windows  are  placed  alternately — one, 
two,  or  more  of  these  chambers  being  let  as  residences  to 
tenants  of  respectability. 

On  the  second  floor  of  this  building  resided  Dr.  Achilli, 
in  the  month  of  July,  in  the  chambers  numbered  8,  9,  and 
10,  but  of  which  No.  9  was  the  entrance  in  use.  On  the 
evening  of  Sunday,  the  29th  of  July,  his  little  family 
party,  consisting  of  himself,  his  wife,  his  brother-in-law, 
Mr.  Uely,  and  his  widowed  sister-in-law,  Signora  Dolci, 
formerly  Miss  Hely,  assembled,  after  the  evening  meal, 
round  the  bed-side  of  Mrs.  Hely,  for  family  worship. 
She  had  long  been  confined  to  her  bed  by  the  illness  whose 
fatal  termination,  in  August,  was  accelerated  by  the 
agitating  events  which  I  am  about  to  relate.  In  the 
course  of  his  prayer.  Dr.  Achilli  prayed  much  for  his  poor 
country,  alluded  to  the  trying  times  in  which  they  were 
placed,  and  asked  for  a  special  blessing  and  direction  for 
each,  according  to  their  respective  need. 

All  then  retired  to  rest,  except. Mr.  Hely,  who  re- 
mained for  some  time  tending  his  sick  wife,  and  had  not 
begun  to  undress  himself,  when,  between  the  hours  of 
eleven  and  twelve,  he  heard  footsteps  and  voices ;  and  soon 
he  was  startled  by  a  loud  tap  at  the  window,  which  opened 
on  the  gallery.  "  Ixt  polizia  !  "  answered  a  gruff  voice  to 
the  alarmed  inquiry  of  the  invalid.  "  The  police  I  admit 
us  instantly  I"  and  the  demand  was  followed  by  a  loud 
ringing  at  the  door  No.  9.  Mr.  Hely  opened  the  door, 
when  three  men  immediately  entered,  whom  he  at  once 
reeognieed  as  the  »birri  of  the  notorious  band  commanded 
by  one  Galanti. 

"  Who  lives  Here  ?  "  asked  the  foremost  of  the  sbirri. 

"  I,  Mr.  Hely,  a  British  subject,  with  my  family ;"  and 
he  plteed  in  their  hands  a  protection,  signed  by  Mr. 
Freeborn,  and  bearing  the  eoofolar  seal  in  wax. 


124  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

"  But  we  want  one  AcMlli,  wlio  lives  here — Domenico 
Antonio  Achilli." 

"  A  Signer  Achilli  lives  here,  but  his  name  is  Gia- 
cinto." 

"  Not  a  bit  of  it :  his  name  is  Domenico  Antonio.  We 
are  agents  of  the  Police ;  we  come  from  the  French  Pre- 
fect, and  he  must  come  with  us  instantly." 

Dr.  Achilli,  roused  by  the  noise,  had  hastily  put  on 
some  clothes  and  made  his  appearance,  and  assured  them 
that  they  were  mistaken ;  that  his  name  was  Giacinto  and 
not  Domenico  Antonio. 

"You  are  a  liar!"  exclaimed  the  ruffian;  "you'll 
deny  your  own  name,  will  you?  Come  along  to  the 
Prefect,  and  come  instantly,  or  we'll  find  means  to 
make  you." 

"  Since  it  is  only  a  question  of  the  identity  of  my 
name,  I  will  put  on  a  coat  and  follow  you  to  the  Prefect." 

At  these  words,  a  cry  of  terror  escaped  from  Madame 
Achilli,  who  was  anxiously  listening  at  the  door,  but  who 
was  not  seen  by  the  sbirri,  as  they  did  not  attempt  to  enter 
the  bed-room.  "  Who  is  that  woman  ?"  cried  the  three 
together :  "  a  woman  in  his  bed-room  !"  and  a  coarse  allu- 
sion to  his  being  a  priest  and  a  friar  rudely  followed. 

Dr.  Achilli  made  all  speed  to  end  this  distressing  scene. 
A  hasty  adieu  to  his  wife,  a  whisper  to  his  brother-in-law 
to  destroy  a  manuscript  tract  which  was  on  his  desk  un- 
finished, and  he  told  the  sbirri  that  he  was  ready  to  follow 
them. 

But  another  scene  was  going  on  below.  In  the  lower 
and  first  story  of  the  Palazzetto  were  quartered  the  Volti- 
geurs,  or  Light  Companies  of  the  25th  Regiment;  and 
Adjutant  Gandon  had  just  returned  to  his  quarters,  with 
Sub-lieutenant  Deschamps,  and  stepped  into  the  loge  du 
Concierge,  or  porter's  room,  to  the  left  of  the  vaulted 
entrance.  Hearing  some  stir,  they  came  out,  and 
were  startled  by  seeing  drawn  up  under  the  archway  a 


RBPOBT—FRBNCB  INDIGNATION— PKBNCB  ARRBST.        125 

Corporal's  party,  whom  they  at  once  recogniaed,  by  their 
g^en  epaulettes,  as  Chasseurs  de  Vincennes — a  fine  corps 
of  riflemen,  raised  by  Louis  Philippe,  and  before  the  last 
Revolution  called  Chasseurs  d'Orleans.  Skulking  under 
the  wall,  Qandon  saw  a  brigand-looking  figure,  armed  up 
to  the  teeth,  whom  he  recognised  at  once  as  a  Roman 
sbirro,  and  loudly  exclaimed,  "Qu  cst-ce que c  est  done?  eat- 
ce  quon  arrite  comme  ca  d  tninuit  dans  une  caserne  Fran- 
caise  ?"  **  Are  French  soldiers  to  act  as  gendarmes  to  this 
police  V  and,  with  loud  exclamations  of  indignation,  ho 
proceeded  upstairs. 

The  other  sbirri,  who  had  not  yet  effected  their  entrance, 
ran  to  meet  him,  and  endeavoured  to  calm  him,  saying, 
"  La  Polizia !  Giustizia !"  At  this  moment,  a  superior 
officer  made  his  appearance  in  the  gallery,  and  ordered  the 
men  of  the  25th  not  to  interfere. 

It  was  time  he  did  so.  Roused  by  Gandon's  voice,  they 
were  already  ascending  the  stairs,  and  their  words  and 
looks  boded  no  good  to  the  wretched  sbirri.  But  the  power 
of  discipline  prevailed ;  and  at  the  officer's  command,  they 
all  sullenly  returned,  and  Gandon  joined  his  friend.  The 
latter  was  in  conversation  with  the  Corporal  of  the  Chas- 
seurs, an  intelligent  young  man,  who  replied  to  the 
remonstrances  with  which  he  was  assailed,  that  he  obeyed 
his  orders,  that  he  came  from  the  Prefecture  of  Police, 
where  he  was  on  guard. 

In  a  short  time,  steps  were  heard  on  the  staircase,  and 
Achilli  came  down  with  the  sbirri.  The  Chasseurs  de 
Vineeimes  ntrroimded  him,  and  carried  him  off.  As  he 
walked  away,  perfectly  calm  and  imreaisting,  the  porter 
of  the  Palazzetto,  who  had  witnessed  the  proceedings, 
exclaimed — *•  They  have  carried  off  the  best  man  in  the 
house."  Where'  he  was  first  taken  to  I  do  not  know,  but 
in  a  few  days  his  friends  found  out  that  he  was  in  the 
Inquisition. 

Up  was  placed  in  a  damp  dungeon ;  from  whence  ho 


12C  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

was  removed,  on  the  remonstrance  of  Mr.  Freeborn,  tlie 
British  Consul,  to  the  Castle  of  St,  Angelo. 

There  he  was  at  first  placed  in  a  room  under  the  roof, 
where  the  heat,  always  insupportable,  was  likely  to  be 
soon  fatal  from  the  sudden  change  of  temperature.  On 
another  remonstrance  from  Mr.  Freeborn — whose  ever- 
active  and  judicious  exertions  have  been  unceasingly 
employed  in  our  friend's  behalf — he  was  removed  to  more 
healthful  quarters. 

You  are  aware  that  all  our  attempts  at  seeing  the 
prisoner  were  in  vain.  The  Cardinal  Vicar  referred  the 
question  to  the  Pope,  and  the  Pope  has  positively  and 
personally  refused. 

I  shall  take  no  notice  of  what  is  said  by  the  Koman 
Correspondent  of  the  Times,  of  the  prospect  of  Dr.  Achilli's 
liberation — as  that  is  an  affair  to  be  settled  with  the 
French  Government,  and  respect  to  that  Government  re- 
quires that  the  duty  of  France  should  not  be  made  matter 
of  argument  by  Dr.  Achilli's  friends,  before  the  subject  has 
been  formally  laid,  with  all  the  evidence,  before  the 
President  of  the  French  Republic.  •  •  • 
Ever,  my  dear  Sir, 

Yours  very  faithfully, 

LEWIS  n.  J.  TONNA. 

To  Sir  Culling  Eardley. 


To  resume  the  Roman  proceedings.  On  the 
8th  December,  M.  Meyrueis  waited  on  M.  de  la 
Tour  d'Auvergne,  Secretary  of  Embassy,  to  hear 
tidings  of  the  General,  who,  he  found,  was  not  yet 
returned  from  the  Pope,  at  Portici.  He  had  a  long 
conversation  with  the  Secretary,  in  the  course  of 
which  a  fact  transpired,  which  M.  Meyrueis  con- 


OtRBBiU:.  OUDDIOrS  RBrUBAL  TO  ARRBOT.  127 

sitlcrs  it  important  that  tiic  friends  of  Dr.  AchilH 
should  know.  M.  de  la  Tour  d'Auvergne  stated, 
that  General  Oudinot  was  ask&lt;  •!  to  lend  his  con- 
currence to  the  arrest  of  Dr.  Achilli,  and  that  he 
refused  it.  There  cannot  be  a  stronger  proof  that 
Frencli  participation  in  the  apprcliension  was  utterly 
unwarrantable.  If,  during  the  French  occupation, 
tlie  Pontifical  Court  has  had  a  strong  friend — most 
peraons  tliink  too  strong— it  is  General  Oudinot.  If 
he,  then,  condemns  the  step,  who  can  defend  it? 
The  Papal  authorities  took  good  care  that  neither 
Genend  Oudinot,  nor  his  military  successors,  should 
know  that  tlie  soldiers  had  been  thus  unworthily 
employed.  Had  he  known  it,  no  one  can  doubt — 
least  of  all,  those  members  of  the  Deputation  who 
conversed  with  him  in  Paris — that  the  same  man 
who  refused  the  open  use  of  a  French  force,  would 
have  vindicated  French  honour,  when  that  force 
was  fraudulently  obtained. 

Dec.  IJ  General  Baraguey  d'Hilliers  returned 
from  Portici,  and  M.  Meyrueis  hastened  to  see  him. 
The  following  is  an  extract  from  his  report : — 

The  Oeoeral  has  obtained  nothing  from  the  Pope  in 
ftvoar  of  oor  friend,  and  to  tho  simple  and  plain  expres- 
sion of  this  rcflttlt  he  only  added,  that  they  were  very  ill 
disposed  to  him  at  Portici.  I  am  ignorant  on  what 
point  he  insisted  for  the  deliverance  of  Achilli,  and  in 
what  point  of  view  ho  has  put  it.     I  fear  much,  that, 


128  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

not  having  obtained  the  political  success  he  so  much 
desired  of  the  Pope's  return,  he  has  not  judged  it  oppor- 
tune to  say  much  for  us.  But  here  is  something  that  will 
surprise  you,  at  least  at  the  first  moment.  When  I  asked 
the  General  if  he  had  received  our  letter  of  the  1st,  at 
Naples,  he  replied  that  he  had.  When  I  said  to  him, 
somewhat  quickly,  that  our  letter  established  with  cer- 
tainty what  he  absolutely  contested  before  his  departure 
for  Portici,  he  replied  to  me,  that  he  did  not  deny  it ;  but 
that  my  presence  here  and  my  proceedings  were  known,  and 
that  this  was  more  unfavourable  than  useful  to  the  cause  of 
our  friend,  hindering  what  he  could  have  done  himself.  I 
said  to  him  that  our  proceedings  were  entirely  justified  by 
the  falseness  of  the  information  that  had  been  transmitted 
from  hence  to  the  Government  before  our  arrival.  We 
had  been  able, — 1st,  to  throw  light  on  the  perfect  morality 
of  Dr.  Achilli,  recognised  by  his  enemies  themselves ; 
2nd,  to  prove  that  he  is  only  the  victim  of  religious  perse- 
cution, which  our  Government  has  publicly  declared 
should  not  be  exercised  here  under  our  flag — (it  is  the 
tricolour  flag  which  floats  at  the  gate  of  the  Palazzo 
Madama,  where  is  the  Roman  Police,  as  well  as  the 
French  Prefect,  and  also  at  the  entrance  of  the  Castle  of 
St.  Angelo) ;  3rd,  the  participation  of  the  authorities  and 
of  the  troop  of  French  Chasseurs  at  the  arrest  of  the  Doctor. 
I  added,  that  I  believed  that  we  had  held,  in  our  proceed- 
ings, all  that  reserve  which  we  had  promised  to  observe, 
and,  without  doubt,  no  one  could  accuse  us  in  that  respect. 
"  Not  the  least  in  the  world,"  said  the  General  with  great 
kindness ;  "  but  I  tell  you  very  frankly,  that  if  you  retire, 
I  can  do  more  than  if  you  remain."  "  But  what  liope 
can  I  place  upon  these  words  ?"  "  Oh,  I  promise  nothing 
— but,  perhaps,  I  may  be  able  to  do  more  than  I  say,  if 
you  leave  me  tlie  field  free.  I  would  not  use  an  expression 
that  would  wound  you ;  but  .  .  .  you  embarass  me.  .  .  . 
Reflect  upon  it ;   my  good  services,  you  understand  me,

are  always  ready  for  you ;  but  fur  the  good  of  your  friend 
it  IB  better  that  yoa  should  leave  this  place.  Think  of  it, 
and  come  when  you  like  to  give  me  an  answer." 

Such  was  nearly  our  conversation.  From  the  first 
moment,  I  felt  I  could  not  resist  the  tdtimatum  of  the 
General,  and  my  reflections  since  that  moment,  as  well  as 
the  advice  of  some  friends  (one  above  all),  have  confirmed 
me  in  that  impression,  and  have  changed  it  into  a  resolu- 
tion, except  in  case  of  the  General's  giving  way  to  the 
obgectians  which  I  intend  to  present  to  him  to-morrow, 
with  a  plan  of  capitulation.  The  following  are  nearly  my 
refleetions.  If  the  General,  more  diplomatic  than  he 
ocmfeflaee  to  be,  is,  cm  fond,  indifferent  to  our  cause,  and 
wiahes  to  get  rid  of  it  (not  of  me,  who  serve  it,  but  of  the 
cause  itselO&gt;  he  will  find  in  my  resistance  to  his  demands 
a  pretext  for  declaring  himself  neuter,  perhaps  hostile, 
and  also  to  throw  upon  what  he  would  call  my  stupid 
obstinacy  the  responsibility  of  the  evil  that  might  arise. 
If  he  is  really  disposed,  at  the  bottom  of  his  heart,  to  do 
all  the  good  actions  for  which  we  have  furnished  lum  with 
the  justification  by  our  information, — if,  above  all,  he 
desires  to  gain  so  much  more  honour,  as  he  would,  if  he 
were  more  independent  in  his  actions,  my  resistance  in 
throwingan  obstacle  in  the  way  of  this  last  satisfaction  might 
stifle  in  him  all  good  will.  ...  As  for  me,  my  presence 
here  is  not  of  much  importance.  It  is  a  pleasing  consola- 
tion to  oar  friend  to  know  it,  and  that  is  much ;  but  I 
cannot  be  of  any  positive  use  to  him, — above  all,  in  case  of 
a  mptare  with  the  General.  As  to  gaining  information,  we 
have  gone  as  far  as  possible  (I  could  not  discover  anything 
more  about  the  Chasseors  de  Vincennes),  and  what  we  have 
is  sufficient  to  establish  the  facts  of  which  the  certainty  was 
necessary  to  us*.  Finally,  in  acquiescing  in  the  desires  of 
the  General,  I  continue  the  mode  of  dealing  with  this 
affair  that  has  been  pursued  throughout — that  is,  one  of 
respectfol  oo-operation  with  our  Government;  and  by  thia 

I 


130  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLL 

new  act  of  submission,  I  throw  upon  him  a  moral  respon- 
sibility, from  which  (though  he  has  promised  nothing, 
he  cannot  withdraw  entirely,  inasmuch  as  he  gives  me  to 
understand  that  he  will  take  the  initiative,  as  soon  as,  by 
my  withdrawing,  I  shall  have  given  this  character  to  his 
proceedings.  .  .  .  My  idea  is,  however,  only  to  beat  a 
retreat  as  far  as  Florence,  and  there  to  wait  for  news  from 
England  and  Kome. 

Dec.  13. — M.  Meyrueis  reports  a  new  incident 
in  the  imprisonment  as  follows  : — 

Yesterday,  Mr.  Freeborn  had  heard  that  Achilli  had 
been  denounced  to  the  Cardinal  Vicar,  by  a  prisoner 
(accused  of  the  theft  of  the  medals  in  the  Vatican,  where 
he  had  been  employed),  as  preaching  the  Gospel  to  his 
companions  in  prison,  and  that  orders  had  been  given 
that  he  should  be  confined  separately  (au  secret).  I  heard, 
myself,  to-day,  from  a  sure  source,  that  this  is  done,  and 
that  the  state  to  which  our  brother  is  reduced,  is  the  most 
rigorous.  But  I  have  full  confidence  that  God  will  not 
permit  his  faith  to  be  shaken.  Mr.  Freeborn  has  seen 
the  General  this  morning,  and  spoke  to  him  of  this 
sorrowful  circumstance,  and  entreated  him,  even  in  the 
name  of  his  own  Government,  not  to  allow  our  friend 
to  be  treated  in  this  way.  I  was  not  sufficiently  sure 
of  the  fact  when  I  saw  him  yesterday,  to  insist  upon 
it  much.  I  contented  myself  with  announcing  it  to 
him. 

Saturday,  Dec.  15. — M.  Meyrueis  thus  reports 
his  second  interview  with  the  General : — 

You  know  that  I  had  to  give  him  an  answer.  I  went 
yesterday  to  his  liouso  for  this  purpose,  but,  being  occupied 
with  his  despatches,  he  was  not  able  to  receive  me.     I  have 


AXOBR  0»  PIUS  IX.  WITH  ACHILLI.  131 

just  now  left  him,  and  I  must  tell  you  that  I  am  more 
satisfietl   than   I  was    the   day  before  yesterday.      The 
Genoral's  manner  towards  mo  really  does  not  allow  me  to 
douht   the  sincerity   of  his  good   dispositions,   unless   I 
suppose  him  the  most  false  of  men,  which  I  cannot  in  my 
conscience  do.     His  position  is  false — that  is  the  evU. 
I  announced  to  him  my  intention  of  submitting  to  his 
wishes — following  in  that  the  plan  which  was  adopted  at 
Paris,   from  the  very   first,  by   Achilli's  friends.     lie 
expressed  his  approbation,  and  renewed  his  assurance  that 
it  was  the  most  useful  step  for  me  to  take  in  our  poor 
friend's  favour.     I  asked  him  what  had  been  the  Pope's 
answer.     His  Iloliness  said,  "  that  Achilli  was  a  cattivo 
toggetto  who  had  done  a  great  deal  of  harm  to  religion,  and 
woald  do  more  if  he  were  free."  The  General  added :  *'  I  can- 
not, I  ought  not  toteU  you  more."  I  said  to  the  General  that 
wo  had  expressed  to  him,  since  our  very  first  interview,  our 
little  confidence  in  the  clemency  of  the  Pope,  of  which  he 
spoke  to  us,  and  that  our  hope  was  in  him  and  in  our  own 
Government.     I  asked  whether  the  result  of  the  informa- 
tion we  had  obtained  at  all  modified  his  views,  and  the 
instructions  he  had  received.  To  that  he  answered,  that  he 
would  not  change  his  ground  ;  that  he  did  not  accept  the 
responsibility  of    France  ;    that  his  information,   which 
differed  from  mine,  allowed  him  to  keep  his  position.     I 
pressed  him  a  little  on  that  point,  saying  that  it  was  a 
question  of  facts ;  that  he  could  not,  whatever  were  his 
instructions,  maintain  himself  in  any  position  when  the 
evidence  of  facts  was  against  it.     He  stopped  me  by 
sajring,  that  he  was  not  obliged  to  give  me  the  motives  for 
his  resolution ;  that  he  should  adhere  to  it ;  that  he  had 
promised  sympathy  and  good  offices ;  that  he  would  not 
vary  from  thi^ ;  that  my  departure  would  facilitate  his 
acting ;  uid  be  added  in   so  many  words,   "  Tell  your 
friends  that  I  promise  you  my  sympathy  and  my  good  offices 
for  Dr.  Achilli — that  General  Baraguey  d'Hilliers  is  a 

i3 


132  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

man  who,  when  he  promises  a  grain,  gives  a  pound  .  .  . 
that  I  will  defend  their  friend's  interest  as  they  would 
themselves."  He  also  said,  "  that  the  French  Government 
could  only  substitute  itself  for  that  of  the  Pope  in  this 
matter,  if  things  changed — if  he  received  fresh  orders  from 
Paris.  Then  he  would  see  what  he  had  to  do."  His  tone 
in  saying  that  seemed  to  say,  **  and  that  is  not  at  all 
impossible." 

I  told  him  that  I  was  going  to  Florence ;  that  if  there 
was  anything  new  he  would  see  me  again.  To  which  he 
answered,  that  I  should  be  welcome.  And  thanking  him 
for  the  kind  reception  he  had  always  given  us,  I  took  my 
leave. 

Wednesday,  Dec.  19. — M.  Meyrueis  thus  writes 
on  the  eve  of  quitting  Rome  : — 

*  *  *  I  have  hardly  time  to  finish  this  letter, 
and  I  cannot  tell  you  so  much  as  I  should  wish.  I  am 
very  sad  at  leaving  this  city.  I  yesterday  saw  Admiral 
Baudin  (who  commanded  the  French  fleet  off  Civita 
Vecchia).  He  leaves  to-morrow  for  France,  and  can 
therefore  only  recommend  our  friend  to  the  General.  He 
was  very  much  interested  and  astonished  at  hearing  the 
fact,  for  M.  de  Corcelles  had  told  him  that  no  one  had  been 
put  in  prison  with  the  assistance  of  France.  As  I  was 
talking  to  him,  his  son  entered,  and  hearing  of  what  we 
were  speaking,  he  said  that  he  had  just  left  M.  de  la  Tour 
d'Auvergnc,  who  was  going  to  the  Cardinal  Vicar  about 
Dr.  Achilli,  to  obtain  from  him  the  assurance  that  he  should 
not  be  placed  in  an  unwholesome  room.  Though  it  was  a 
small  thing,  it  pleased  me  to  see  that  the  General  took 
some  steps  in  the  matter. 

This  morning  I  have  seen  the  Charge  d'Affaires  of  the 
United  States  here,  to  whom  I  related  the  whole  affair, 
which  he  already  knew  in  part,  and  in  which   he  had 


WITHDRAWAL  OP  M.  MBYRUBI8  PROM  ROMB.  133 

already  interested  hiinficlf ;  so  much  so,  that  he  has  spoken 
of  it  to  the  General,  whom  he  knew  in  Paris  and  in 
Alters.  He  is  the  son  of  the  former  Ambassador  at  Paris, 
Mr.  Cass.  He  told  me  that  the  affair  was  a  serious  one, 
and  that  the  Government  of  the  Pope  had  absolutely 
dedared  that  they  would  not  liberate  Achilli. 

From  another  person,  whom  I  cannot  name  to  you,  I 
heard  these  words  :  "  This  man  will  bear  the  weight  of  all 
the  Revolution."  You  may  easily  judge  under  what 
anxiety  I  am  leaving  Rome.  No  remedy  can  be  found 
but  at  Paris.  A  precise  order  must  be  sent  to  the 
General. 

The  next  day  M.  Meymeis  left  the  city  for 
Civita  Veccliia,  from  whence  he  addressed  to  Gene- 
ral Baraguey  d'Hilliers,  onthe21st,  a  letter  couched 
in  the  strongest  but  most  respectful  language.  A 
more  irresistible  appeal  to  the  hearts  and  honour  of 
Frenchmen,  could  not  be  made,  than  by  the  pub- 
lication of  M.  Meyrueis's  letter  to  the  General.* 
"  General,'*  says  M.  Meyrueis,  "  it  is  evident  to  me, 
that  the  occult  power  which  used  our  soldiers  as  its 
secular  arm,  had  no  other  effective  force  but  their 
agency.  And  who  placed  them  at  its  service,  and 
that  not  in  tliis  instance  alone?  (for  those  brave 
fellows  often  shuddered  with  indignation  at  tlieir 
work,  as  you,  G^eral,  are  perfectly  aware) — who

134  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI, 

but  the  French  authorities  ?  Now,  it  is  impossible  in 
good  faith  to  admit  the  irresponsibility  of  the  person 
who  contents  himself  with  washing  his  hands,  even 
though  he  may  say,  *  I  am  innocent  of  the  blood  of 
that  just  man.' 

"  And  does  the  responsibility  stop  with  the 
agents  ?  No,  it  ascends  logically  to  the  Government 
which  had  promised  at  the  Tribune  that  such  scenes 
should  never  be  witnessed."  The  writer  then  calls 
upon  the  General  to  claim  from  Paris  liberty  to  put  an 
end  to  this  abominable  iniquity.  "  The  liberation 
of  Dr.  Achilli,"  he  adds,  "will  do  you  a  great 
honour,  General ;  and  whether  on  the  part  of  en- 
lightened Christians  of  all  communities,  and  of  all 
nations,  or  on  the  part  of  all  men  of  right  feeling, 
or  on  the  part  of  all  good  Frenchmen,  it  cannot  but 
be  hailed  with  acclamations  of  applause." 

In  the  meantime,  the  General  had  been  as  good 
as  his  word ;  for  on  Thursday,  Dec.  20,  while  M. 
Meyrueis  was  quitting  Rome,  the  French  Govern- 
ment had  received,  in  Paris,  a  telegraphic  despatch, 
via  Toulon,  from  that  city.  The  General  announced 
to  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs,  that  the  Roman 
Government  had,  at  length,  determined  to  set  Dr. 
Achilli  at  liberty,  conducting  him  to  the  frontiers, 
provided  the  British  Government,  and  his  friends  in 
England,  would  engage  that  he  should  leave  Italy. 


THl  0ABDI5AL8  AOREB  TO  UDERATB  ACHILLI.  135 

Thauks,too,  to  modem  facilitiesof  communication, 
on  the  morning  of  Saturday,  December  22,  while  M. 
Meyrueis  was  composing  his  report,  in  much  anxiety 
of  mind,  on  board  the  St.  George  steamer,  in  the 
Mediterranean,  the  gratifying  intelligence  above 
referred  to  had  reached  Devonshire  from  Paris. 
Lord  Normanby,  the  British  Ambassador  at  Paris, 
had,  it  appeared,  without  a  moment's  hesitation, 
written  to  Dr.  Achilli  with  his  own  hand,  informing 
him  of  the  consent  of  the  Roman  Government  to  his 
liberation,  and  urging  him  to  come  to  Paris  the 
moment  he  should  be  at  liberty.  The  French  Govern- 
ment had  expressed  themselves  satisfied  with  this  step 
of  Lord  Normanby's,  as  the  fulfilment  of  the  condition 
required  by  the  Pope  from  the  British  Government. 

Dr.  AchilH's  friends  in  England,  in  compliance 
with  Lord  Normanby's  wish,  immediately  wrote  to 
him,  begging  him  to  come  immediately,  vici  Paris, 
to  Ent^land.  This  letter  was  sent  to  the  British 
Embassy  in  Paris,  and  from  thence,  through  Sir 
George  Hamilton,  our  Minister  at  Florence,  to  Mr. 
Petre,  the  British  Diplomatic  Agent  at  Rome,  to  be 
delivered  to  the  prisoner. 

Within  three  or  four  days,  however,  by  regular 
poet,  the  news  arrived  in  England  of  the  strong  lan- 
guage, already  mentioned,  of  the  Pope  to  General 
Baraguey  d'Hilliers,  about  the  danger  which  would 


136  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

result  to  religion  from  setting  Dr.  Achilli  at  liberty ; 
together  with  the  intelligence  of  his  subsequent  soli- 
tary confinement.  The  apprehension  could  not  but 
force  itself  on  the  mind,  that  the  proposed  intention 
to  liberate  him  was  only  a  ruse  to  gain  time,  as 
dishonourable  to  those  who  employed  it,  as  it  would 
be  insulting  to  the  statesmen  deceived.  This 
anxiety  was  communicated  to  the  Foreign  Minister 
in  Paris ;  but  the  reply  was  most  decided,  that  the 
Government  knew  of  no  hitch  in  the  arrangement 
made  between  the  French  and  Roman  Governments ; 
that  it  was  not  likely  that  any  obstacles  should  be 
known  in  England,  when  they  had  not  been  reported 
to  Paris  by  the  French  agents  at  Rome ;  and  that 
the  Government  had  no  reason  to  doubt  that  the 
prisoner  was  already  on  his  way  to  join  his  French 
and  English  friends. 

Dr.  Achilli's  friends  could  only  say  that  they 
hoped  the  Government  might  be  right ;  but  that, 
from  what  they  knew  of  the  character  of  the  parties 
to  be  dealt  with,  they  retained  their  apprehen- 
sions. They  would,  however,  respectfully  await 
the  result. 

That  result  was  known  in  Paris  about  January 
10,  1850,  and  was  quite  in  accordance  with  the 
expectations  of  Dr.  Achilli's  friends,  who  knew  that 
the  Court  of  Rome  shrinks  from  no  deception  which

will  answer  its  purpose.  Tlie  letter  of  Lord  Normanby 
to  Dr.  Achilli,  and  the  concurrence  of  the  French 
Govemraent  in  the  conditions  of  the  Cardinals,  had 
arrived  in  Rome  towards  the  end  of  December. 
General  Baraguey  d'Hilliers,  believing  that  he  had  to 
deal  with  men  as  upright  as  himself,  instead  of  open- 
ing the  prison  doors  at  once,  and  reporting  to  the  Pope 
that  he  had  done  so,  thought  it  more  courteous,  and 
therefore  preferable,  to  write  first  to  the  Pope  at 
Portici,  telling  him  that  the  conditions  were  accepted, 
and  requesting  Inm  to  authorise  the  immediate 
lilx^ration.  The  Pope  refused  to  do  so,  saying  that 
he  would  take  the  subject  into  consideration  upon 
his  own  arrival  at  Rome  ! ! 

This  circumstance  was  known  to  the  French 
Government,  as  has  been  stated,  on  or  before  the 
10th  January,  and  thereupon  very  decided  instruc- 
tions were  instantly  sent  off  to  Rome,  which 
appear  to  have  arrived  there  on  the  16th.  "  Letters 
from  Rome  of  the  17th  instant,"  says  the  Corres- 
pondent of  the  TimeSj  "  state  that  on  the  preceding 
evening  General  Baraguey  d'Hilliers  suddenly  left 
for  Portici,  on  the  receipt  of  despatches  brought  to 
him  by  express  from  Paris.  His  journey  was 
believed  to  be  connected  with  the  return  of  the 
Pope  to  Rome,  which  was  an.xiously  desired  by  the 
French  Government."     What  was  the  purpose  of 


138  IMPRISONMENT,  (fee.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

this  journey  must  be  left  to  the  reader's  conjecture  ; 
but,  after  an  interval  of  two  days,  the  General 
returned,  and  on  the  20th  despatched  from  Rome  a 
telegraphic  message  to  Paris,  announcing, — but  the 
liberated  prisoner  shall  tell  his  own  story. 

DR.  ACHILLI  TO  SIR  CULLING  EARDLEY. 

Pakis,  February  3,  1850. 

My  dear  Sir  Culling, 

As  you  are  anxious  to  know  the  particulars  of  my 
leaving  prison,  and  of  the  manner  in  which  I  escaped  from 
Eome  (I  mean  the  Rome  of  the  priests,  not  my  dearly- 
loved  country),  1  will  tell  you  frankly  the  whole  circum- 
stances. 

I  shall  make  my  story  more  connected,  by  relating 
some  of  the  events  of  the  last  days  of  my  imprisonment, 
to  enable  you  to  know  the  state  of  things  in  general,  and 
also  my  personal  condition  at  that  time. 

My  kind  friend,  M.  Meyrueis,  on  quitting  Rome,  left 
me  a  few  lines  of  encouragement,  telling  me  how  much 
cause  I  had  for  hope  both  from  God  and  man.  He  assured 
me  of  the  good  dispositions  of  General  Baraguey  d'llil- 
liers,  who  had  made  Mm  repeated  promises  of  using  every 
intercession  with  the  Pope,  beyond  which  point,  at  that 
time,  the  instructions  of  his  Government  did  not  extend. 
The  affair  was  to  be  treated  with  "  des  bons  ojices."  This 
may  be  quite  right,  I  said  to  myself, — but  with  nothing 
but  good  offices,  I  shall  remain  in  prison  to  the  end  of  the 
chapter.  And  this  1  said  with  good  reason,  for  none  knew 
better  than  myself  the  evil  dispositions  of  the  priests,  who 
would  far  rather  pardon  Mazzini  and  Garibaldi  than  me ; 
and  let  any  one  rather  than  me  escape  from  Rome.  Con- 
sequently, my  hope  in  men  was  almost  at  an  end,  but  my 
confidence  in  God  daily  augmented ;  so  much  so,  that  from 


MSASURB8  m  PARIS— VI8IT0IIS  ANNOUNCED  IN  PRISON.    139 

my  increasing  faith  in  the  protection  of  Him  who  can  do 
everything  independently  of  men,  I  began  to  reckon  on 
my  lil&gt;eration  as  an  approaching  event,  and  I  remember 
writing  a  letter  to  my  dear  wife,  in  which  I  spoke  of  it  as 
certain. 

On  the  morning  of  December  24  —  a  day  usually 
consecrated  in  Rome  to  the  congratulations  and  good 
wishes  of  friends — my  good  gaoler  came  to  me  to  say  that 
an  order  had  come  from  the  French  General,  to  allow  me 
to  have  free  conmiunication  with  a  certain  Dr.  Bambozzi 
and  another  person  with  him,  whenever  they  might  come 
to  see  me.  The  good  gaoler,  not  knowing,  as  I  did,  who 
the  parties  were  who  had  such  ample  permission,  denied 
in  every  other  case,  to  converse  with  me,  endeavoured  to 
persuade  me  that  they  were  really  two  of  my  friends,  who 
had  by  great  exertions  succeeded  in  obtaining  what  had 
been  granted  to  no  one  else.  But  I  was  not  deceived.  The 
more  so,  when  I  knew-  the  next  day  that  the  Adjutant  of 
the  Fort,  a  devoted  friend  of  the  priests,  had  asked  and 
obtained  from  the  Cardinals  a  confirmation  of  the  order.  I 
said  to  myself,  Either  this  is  an  agreement  and  under- 
standing between  the  Cardinals  and  the  French  General, 
or  the  Cardinals  have  performed  one  of  their  common 
manoeuvres  to  engage  and  compromise  the  French  authori- 
ties in  a  matter  altogether  in  their  interest.  My  fellow- 
prisoners,  to  whom  I  communicated  my  doubts,  fully 
agreed  with  me.  Eight  days  elapsed,  and  Dr.  Bambozzi, 
annoanced  with  so  great  interest,  had  not  yet  appeared. 
This  made  my  fellow-prisoners  and  myself  constantly 
laugh  at  the  name  of  my  visitor  and  at  his  expected  visit. 
On  December  SJ ,  I  was  asked  for  by  two  persons,  who  an- 
noanced themselves  as  "  visitors."  The  door  opened,  and 
in  came  a  priest,  in  fact  a  Motuignore,  whom  I  recognised 
from  his  purple  tippet,  and  another  person,  both  strangers 
to  me.  They  received  me  with  great  gravity,  and,  after 
having  looked  at  me  from  head  to  foot,  made  me  a  signal 


140  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OP  DR.  ACHILLI. 

to  sit  down.  I  then  discovered  that  they  were  two  judges, 
and  knew  the  quarter  that  they  came  from.  (I  afterwards 
ascertained  that  the  priest  was  Monsignor  Bambozzi,  the 
Fiscal  of  the  Inquisition,  and  the  other  the  Advocate  De 
Dominicis,  Chancellor  of  the  Inquisition.)  After  we  were 
seated  all  three  round  a  table,  the  priest  made  a  sign  to 
the  other  to  write,  and  began  to  dictate  to  him  in  Latin. 
"  A  certain  man  {homo  quidam)  appeared  before  me,  who 
declares  his  name  to  be  Giacinto  Achilli,  son  of  .  .  .  born 
at  .  .  .  aged  about  .  .  .  dressed  (here  follows  the  descrip- 
tion of  my  dress  from  head  to  foot),  committed  to  this 
prison,  &amp;c.,  who,  being  interrogated  whether  he  knew  why 
he  was  imprisoned,  replied,  *  I  have  been  here  for  six 
months,  and  I  do  not  yet  know  why  I  was  arrested.'  In- 
terrogated if  he  knew  by  what  tribunal  he  was  now 
arraigned  and  examined,  he  replied,  '  I  wish  to  be  in- 
formed.' And  being  told  that  he  was  arraigned  and 
examined  by  the  Magistrates  of  the  Holy  Inquisition,  he 
replied,  '  I  am  very  glad  of  it.'  Admonished  to  tell  the 
truth  and  to  recognise  in  this  fact  the  justice  of  God  and 
not  the  vengeance  of  man,  he  replied  to  the  first  part,  *  I 
promise  to  tell  the  truth ;'  on  the  second  he  was  silent." 

At  this  point,  he  produced  a  quire  of  paper,  covered 
with  writing,  and  began  to  read  the  first  page,  from  which 
I  perceived  that  it  was  the  minute  taken  down  the  second 
day  of  my  imprisonment,  by  a  judge  of  the  Cardinal  Vicar, 
consisting  of  a  general  interrogatory  on  the  whole  of  my 
life — that  is  to  say,  my  education,  my  studies,  my  public 
functions,  my  occupations,  my  joumies,  and  especially 
that  to  the  Ionian  Islands,  Malta,  England,  &amp;c.,  till  my 
return  to  Rome  ;  what  I  had  done  during  the  Roman  Re- 
public ;  and  finishing  with  my  imprisonment.  All  this, 
confronted  anew  with  numerous  questions,  formed  the 
subject  of  my  first  interview  with  Monsignor  Bambozzi 
and  his  companion.  In  a  moment,  the  whole  Castle  of 
St.  Angelo  was  full  of  the  news,  that  the  Judges  of  the 


riBCAL  AND  0HA5CBLL0R  OF  THB  INQUISITION.  141 

Inqaisition,  with  special  permission  of  the  French  au- 
thorities, had  come  to  take  possession  of  me.  You  can 
imagine  the  indignation  felt,  and  the  severe  expressions 
employed  against  the  priests  and  the  French.  I  alone 
smiled  in  the  midst  of  the  universal  excitement.  Four 
days  afterwards,  the  two  Magistrates  of  the  Inquisition 
were  again  announced.  Thereupon,  a  new  and  very  long 
interrogatory  (still  in  Latin),  why  I  had  abandoned  the 
Order  of  Dominicans,  from  which,  up  to  the  last  day,  I  had 
received  so  many  testimonies  of  esteem  and  goodwill,  so  as 
even  to  be  promoted  in  my  youth  to  the  highest  and  most 
important  posts  with  difficulty  granted  to  the  aged  ?  Why 
I  had  afterwards  abandoned  the  ministry  of  the  Roman 
Church,  my  theological  functions,  the  mass  and  other 
religious  duties,  showing  myself  thankless  and  ungrateful 
for  my  education,  and  for  the  interest  taken  in  me  at 
Rome?  What  complaint  I  had  to  make  of  the  trifling 
correction  received  on  my  appearance  before  the  Inqui- 
sition in  1842,  the  sole  object  of  which  was  to  recall  me  to 
the  right  path  ?  Lastly,  why  I  had  left  Rome  and  gone 
out  of  Italy  to  take  refuge  in  Protestant  countries,  and 
made  myself  the  subject  of  so  much  conversation,  to  the 
scandal  of  my  best  friends  and  to  the  fearful  injury  of  my 
soul?  This  is  the  substance  of  the  second  examination,  to 
which  I  calmly  replied,  with  a  few  words  to  each  question, 
— that  motives  of  conscience  had  induced  me  to  leave  the 
Dominicans,  to  whom  I  still  felt  grateful  for  their  kind- 
ness,— that  I  had  done  so  with  full  licence  from  Pope 
Gregory  XVI., — that  motives  of  conscience  had  also  led 
me  to  leave  the  ministry  of  the  Roman  Church,  and,  far 
from  being  displeased  with  the  Inquisition,  I  had  tran- 
quilly resigned  to  it  all  the  charges  of  the  ministry,  and 
thereby  declared,  sufficiently  for  whoever  chose  to  under- 
stand me,  that  thenceforward  I  did  not  intend  to  belong  to 
that  Church,  any  longer  or  in  any  manner,  not  regarding 
myself,  in  matters  of  faith,  bound  io  any  one  but  to  Qod, 


142  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACniLLI. 

— ^lastly,  my  leaving  Rome  and  going  out  of  Italy  had 
been  a  consequence  of  the  foregoing  antecedents  ;  it  did 
not  signify  whether  I  went  to  the  English  or  Spanish 
dominions  ;  wherever  I  was,  I  had  led  an  upright  life  ;  in 
other  respects,  I  did  not  consider  it  my  duty  to  render  an 
account  to  any  man.  This  was  the  purport  of  my  replies, 
intending  to  speak  at  greater  length  whenever  Monsignor 
Bambozzi  entered  upon  questions  of  faith.  But  no  ques- 
tions of  that  sort  were  put  to  me ;  indeed,  when  I  tried  to 
turn  the  conversation  that  way,  he  diverted  it  by  some 
new  question.  The  second  interrogatory  closed  with 
personal  civilities.  He  ordered  the  gaoler  to  let  me  take 
the  air  a  little  every  day  for  about  a  quarter  of  an  hour, 
on  the  terrace  of  the  Castle,  saying  that  he  was  perfectly 
satisfied  with  me,  and  that  we  were  perfectly  agreed  ! !  I 
do  not  know  with  what  truth  he  could  say  so,  for  my 
whole  answers  were  nothing  whatever  but  a  rebuff  to  his 
questions,  and  my  spirit  showed  itself  throughout  diame- 
trically opposed  to  his.  But  the  Inquisition  has  always 
been  about  as  anxious  for  truth  as  Pontius  Pilate  before 
our  Lord.  At  taking  leave  this  second  time,  both  my 
Judges  shook  hands  with  me,  saying  that  they  would 
return  shortly.  Eight  days  elapsed,  when  I  was  again 
asked  for.  "Here  is  Bambozzi!"  cried  my  fellow- 
prisoners  ;  and  I  went  down  stairs  laughing,  when,  in  his 
place,  I  beheld  a  Priest  of  the  Oratory  alone,  who  was 
full  of  civility  in  receiving  me.  I  perceived  at  once  by 
his  accent  that  he  was  not  an  Italian.  I  inquired  his  name 
and  the  object  of  his  coming.  He  replied,  that  he  was 
come  to  pay  me  a  visit,  and  showed  me  his  name  on  the 
title-page  of  a  book :  "  Dr.  Augustine  Theiner,  of  Prussian 
Silesia,  Professor  of  Ecclesiastical  History  in  the  College 
of  the  Propaganda  in  Rome."  He  said  that  he  was 
grieved  at  my  present  situation,  but  that  all  would  bo  for 
the  best  if  I  would  only  be  teachable  towards  God,  and 
towards  the  Holy  Mother  the  Roman  Catholic  Church. 


PROriSSOR  OF  COLLEGE  DB  PROPAGANDA  FIDE.    143 

This  at  once  brought  us  to  the  question,  whether  the 
Roman  Church  alone  had  a  right  to  be  called  Catholic.  I 
maintained  that  the  Roman  was  a  Church,  but  not  the 
Church,  and  by  logical  consequence  could  not  be  called 
imiversal,  for  the  simple  reason  that  Rome  is  not  the 
whole  world, — that  the  Pope  was  Bishop  of  the  Roman 
Church  alone,  and  not  of  the  Catholic  Church  ;  the 
proof  being,  that  many  hundreds  of  bishops  exist  in 
the  Church,  some  dependent  and  others  independent  of 
Rome,  without  reckoning  all  those  Christian  Churches 
which  pride  themselves  on  having  no  other  bishop  than 
the  one  mentioned  by  Peter,  1st  Epistle,  ii.  23.  He  asked 
me,  smiling,  what  my  Church  was  ?  I  told  him  it  was 
that  of  which  St.  Paul  speaks,  Hebrews  xii.  23,  "  the 
General  Assembly  and  Church,"  Ac.  To  a  few  other 
questions  I  replied  to  the  same  purport.  He  exhorted  me 
to  read  that  book  of  his,  printed  by  the  Propaganda,  on 
which  he  had  shown  me  his  name,  and  thereupon  we  took 
leave.  The  book  is  a  "  History  of  the  Reformation  in 
Sweden,"  written,  it  would  appear,  on  purpose  to  blacken 
the  fame  of  those  Reformers,  the  good  King  Gustavus  and 
the  excellent  Oloff  Peterson,  and  to  have  the  opportunity 
of  using  every  description  of  epithets  the  most  offensive 
against  Luther.  This  work,  as  the  puthor  told  me,  has  had 
the  honour  of  being  translated  into  French  by  M.  Monta- 
lembert,  and  into  English  by  Dr.  Newman,  who  is  also 
become  a  Priest  of  the  Oratory.  A  second  and  third  visit 
from  Dr.  Theiner,  who  came  to  me  with  other  books  of  his 
own  writing,  which  he  eagerly  requested  me  to  read,  were 
occupied  with  continual  questions  on  the  Roman  Church, 
resting  upon  certain  passages  of  the  Holy  Fathers  to  prove 
that  it  ia  the  Catholic  Church ;  and  with  my  observations 
from  the  Fathers  themselves,  asserting  that  what  they 
called  Catholic  was  the  Roman  Church  together  with  all 
others,  those  only  excepted  which  deviated  from  the  teach- 
ing of  the  Holy  Scriptures  and  from  the  faith  of  Christ, — 


144  IMPRISONMENT,  &amp;c.  OF  DR.  ACHILLI. 

the  Roman  Oliurch  being  very  diflferent  in  the  time  of  the 
Fathers  from  what  it  is  in  our  days,  especially  since  the 
Council  of  Trent;  that  the  holy  Fathers,  if  they  were 
now  living,  would  be  the  first  to  protest  against  the  Eoman 
Church  and  to  separate  from  it ;  that  a  reformation  was 
needed,  before  the  present  Roman  Church  could  be  called 
Christian,  the  Jewish  and  the  Pagan  elements  having  so  pre- 
vailed in  the  doctrine  and  worship,  that  there  hardly  remains 
a  shade  of  primitive  Christianity ;  that  let  but  the  Pope  un- 
dertake this  reformation,  we  would  be  with  him,  otherwise 
we  must  remain  separated ;  nor  should  his  threats  ter- 
rify us,  nor  his  Inquisition  rob  the  Christians  of  Italy  of 
their  faith  or  their  union  ;  that  I  had  shown  an  example  to 
the  brethren  how  to  propagate  in  this  country  the  pure 
and  simple  doctrine  of  Christ ;  that  the  Bible,  and  the 
Bible  alone,  was  sufficient  to  destroy  the  whole  edifice  of 
the  Pope ;  and  that  the  day  when  I  saw  reprinted  in  Rome 
the  New  Testament  in  Italian,  and  moreover  beheld  the 
avidity  with  which  the  Romans  received  it,  I  exclaimed, 
"  It  is  all  over  with  the  Papacy  T^ 

These  and  similar  things  I  said  to  the  good  Padre 
Theiner  with  even  greater  frankness  than  I  tell  yourself. 
My  heart  almost  leaped  out  of  my  breast  with  joy  at  having 
been  able,  in  the  prisons  of  the  Roman  Inquisition,  to 
render  this  testimony  to  the  truth  and  to  the  religion  of 
Jesus  Christ.  "  I  am  as  happy  as  possible  now,"  I  said  to 
several  of  those  good  friends  who  were  with  me  in  prison, 
and  who  asked  me  every  time  how  I  had  got  on  with  the 
Papal  theologian.  "I  am  only  afraid  that,  perhaps,  feeling 
how  firm  I  am,  he  may  discontinue  his  visits,  and  tell  the 
Cardinals  and  the  Pope  that  every  attempt  to  bring  me 
back  to  the  Roman  Church  is  useless."  He  had  in  fact, 
at  his  second  visit,  shown  me  a  letter  of  the  Cardinal  Vicar, 
in  which  he  appointed  him,  by  the  Pope's  desire,  to  come  to 
me  tinder  the  guise  of  a  visitor,  to  hold  conferences  with  me, 
and  to  discover  some  way  of  recovering  me  to  their  faith. 


COXTROVBRST— KNTRANCB  OP  FRENCH  80LPreR5&gt;.  I  }w 

At  the  end  of  each  visit,  however,  I  requeotod  Liiii  to 
report  all  that  I  had  said  to  him,  adding  that  I  was  more 
and  more  firm  in  my  purpose,  and  that  if  it  pleased  God 
that  I  shoiild  quit  my  prison,  I  should,  with  the  grace  of 
God,  continue  my  mission  with  all  the  more  vigour,  from 
perceiving  that  it  was  acceptable  to  Him  who  had  conferred 
on  me  the  grace  to  suffer  six  months  of  very  severe  im- 
prisonment for  Ilis  name's  sake.  This,  however,  I  said, 
let  the  Pope  and  Cardinals  remember,  that  a  scandalous 
persecution  of  this  sort  cannot  and  will  not  be  excused, 
even  in  the  eyes  of  Roman  Catholics  who,  like  ourselves, 
abhor  religious  persecution.  My  imprisonment,  I  said, 
must,  if  it  does  nothing  more,  at  least  bear  the  fruit  of 
the  perpetual  abolition  of  the  Roman  Inquisition. 

I  was  in  the  middle  of  the  third  visit  of  the  Padre 
Theiner,  in  the  full  fervour  of  our  controversies,  when 
the  Captain  of  the  Castle  came  to  inform  me  that  two 
Cfuuseurs  de  Vincennes  were  arrived,  to  take  me  to  the 
French  Council  of  War,  to  give  evidence  in  the  cause  of 
&gt;  "lor  Cemuschi,  Deputy  of  the  People  under  the  Rc- 
i  u -iic.  I  was  not  more  surprised  than  my  theologian, 
who  was  even  more  unable  than  myself  to  comprehend 
how  I,  separated  from  the  rest  of  the  world  by  virtue  of 
the  laws  of  the  Inquisition,  could  be  summoned  before  a 
military  tribunal  by  a  foreign  authority.  The  Captain 
added,  that  there  was  the  permission  of  the  Cardinal  Vicar. 
"  Ijct  us  go  in  the  name  of  the  Lord,"  was  my  thought. 
The  Padre  Theiner  accompanied  me  to  the  carriage,  in 
which  two  soldiers  armed  with  carbines  sat  by  my  side.

alone.     He  put  a  few  questions  to  me  about  the  person  of 

Cernuschi,  and  said  some  other  things  to  me 

He  then  remanded  me  to  the  Castle. 

The  next  day,  the  19th  January,  my  theologian  visited 
me  again,  and  plied  me  with  vehement  arguments, 
which  I  answered  with  arguments  still  more  vehement. 
Our  subject  was  the  bishopric  of  St.  Peter  at  Rome,  and 
the  privilege  of  succession  bequeathed  to  the  Popes  ;  Dr. 
Theiner  all  intent  on  demonstrating,  and  I  on  confuting, 
it.  In  the  midst  of  the  discussion,  which  had  lasted 
some  time  (it  now  being  nearly  dark),  my  gaoler  came  to 
tell  me  that  the  two  Chasseurs  were  come  back  again  to 
take  me  to  the  Military  Commission.  "  Farewell !  Padre 
Theiner.  Offer  my  respects  to  the  Cardinal  Vicar,  and  thank 
him  in  my  name  for  your  visits,  which  have  given  me  real 
pleasure  ;  I  hope  that  both  of  us  may  derive  profit  from 
them,  to  confirm  us  more  and  more  in  the  Word  of  God  !" 
Having  said  this,  I  pressed  his  hand  and  got  into  the  car- 
riage between  the  two  soldiers.  This  time  the  carriage 
was  an  open  one,  and,  traversing  the  long  street  from  the 
Castle  to  the  Minerva,  I  saw  and  was  seen  by  many  per- 
sons. A  novel  sight  indeed  !  A  prisoner  of  the  Inquisition 
held  in  custody  by  the  arms  of  the  French  Kepublic  !  The 
Capitaine  Rapporteur  was  very  obliging,  and  I  am  sure 
felt  personal  sympathy  with  me.  I  will  not  repeat  the  con- 
versations which  I  had  with  him I  will  only  say  that 

I  was  greatly  cheered,  and  I  could  not  help  feeling  as  if  I 
were  free  and  my  own  master.  I  determined  to  try  if  it  were 

80 In  an  anti-chamber  were  several  sets  of  military 

accoutrements.  In  a  moment  I  had  dressed  myself  cap-d- 
pie  as  a  French  soldier.  The  doors  on  to  the  landing  were 
open,  and  the  egress  not  guarded  by  a  single  individual.  It 
was  half-past  five  in  the  evening.  I  did  what  any  one  else 
would  have  done,  and  I  did  it  with  a  smile.  I  descended  into 
the  Piazza  di  Minerva,  passed  through  the  Strada  Pik 


MILITARY  TRIBUHAL-DB.  ACHILLI  AT  LIBERTY.  147 

di  MarmOf  the  Piazza  del  CoUegio  Romano,  and  walked 
through  the  Corso,  disguised  as  I  ^as.    I  changed  my  dress 

at ,  where  money  was  prepared  for  me.     A  carriage 

with  poet-horses  was  speedily  ready,  and  a  passport.  At 
seven,  p.m.,  I  passed  the  walls  of  Rome,  blessing  the  Lord, 
and  committing  to  Him  my  country,  my  brethren,  and 
that  infant  Church  which  will  on  ^  ^^ay  be  an  example  to 
all  the  Churches,  so  that  it  may  again  be  said  of  the 
Romans,  that  "  their  faith  is  spoken  of  throughout  the 
whole  world."  In  six  hours,  I  arrived  at  Civita  Vecchia, 
rested  till  daylight,  presented  several  letters,  and  em- 
barked on  board  a  steamer  of  war.  The  whole  of  that  day 
(20th)  I  passed  in  the  port,  engaged  in  tlianking  my  God, 
and  in  praying  to  Him  to  provide  for  me  in  all  respects. 
I  wrote  a  farewell  letter  to  the  brethren  in  Rome,  which  I 
g^t  a  person  to  post.  The  next  day  we  sailed  for  Toulon, 
and  from  thence  I  went  to  Marseilles,  where  I  was  unable 
to  remain.  I  stopped,  however,  a  day  at  Lyons,  to  em- 
brace our  excellent  friend  M.  Fisch,  and  the  other 
brethren,  who  felt  as  if  they  could  not  bless  and  thank  the 
Lord  enough  for  my  unexpected  liberation.  Oh,  what 
enjoyments  has  the  Christian  life,  even  on  this  earth  !  In 
my  case,  what  I  have  suffered  is  now  sweet  and  delightful 
to  me.  It  is  to  my  body  like  a  dream,  but  a  reality  to 
my  spirit.  What  a  true  interest  we  have  in  serving  the 
Lord !  I  need  not  tell  you  the  exultation  of  our  beloved 
brethren  in  Paris.  Already  we  have  held  many  prayer- 
meetings  to  thank  my  first  and  true  Deliverer.  But  I 
hope  never  to  forget  the  gratitude  which,  under  God,  I 
owe  to  the  dear  brethren  of  the  Evangelical  Alliance,  who 
have  indeed  set  an  example  the  most  edifying  of  Christian 
charity.  The  Lord  bless  you  all,  my  beloved  friends,  and 
recompense  you  through  His  grace  in  the  great  day  of 
account  I  I  had  no  claim  whatever  upon  you ;  it  was  the 
eharity  of  religion,  the  love  of  the  brethren,  which  led  you 
to  exert  younelvea  in  my  behalf.      Of  such  kindness,

faith  was  the  motive  principle, — that  faith  which  justifies 
lis  before  God,  unto  whom  alone  be  glory  and  honour  and 
blessing,  through  Jesus  Christ  our  Lord. 

I  am,  my  dear  Sir  Culling, 

Yours  affectionately, 

GIACINTO  ACHILLI. 

Will  not  every  Christian  say  Amen  to  our 
brother's  giving  of  thanks  ? 

I  will  add  no  more,  as  Dr.  Achilli  will  speedily 
be  in  England  to  answer  for  himself.  In  closing,  I 
will  only  express  the  hope,  first,  that  in  speaking  as 
I  have  done  of  the  Court  of  Rome,  I  shall  be 
understood  as  not  for  an  instant  believing  that 
Roman  Catholics  in  general  have  a  fellow-feeling 
with  its  tyranny ;  and,  secondly,  that  in  avoiding, 
as  far  as  consistent  with  my  object,  the  publication 
of  the  acts  and  words  of  public  men,  my  motives 
will  be  appreciated. 

This  work  I  commit  in  faith  to  God,  in  the 
name  of  my  Lord  and  Saviour,  who  can,  if  he 
think  fit,  employ  even  such  a  simple  narrative  as  the 
present  for  the  promotion  of  His  gracious  purposes.

LEHERI. 

TO  GREGORY  XVI., 

Bishop  a5d  Sotxhbiox  of  Roxb, 

GIACI5T0  ACHILLI,  Mixistxr  of  thx  Itauan  Cathouc 

Church. 

However  my  sentiments  may  be  already  known  to  you  from 
several  letters,  written  by  me  recently  to  your  two  Caniinals, 
Pt^ori  and  Lambni9chini,  still  I  regard  it  as  desirable  to 
make  a  more  ample  declaration  of  them  to  yourself,  so  as  to 
throw  greater  light  on  my  faitli,  and  to  leave  no  longer  in  doubt 
the  form  of  religion  which  I  follow  and  profess. 

Beliere  not,  Holy  Father,  that  I  am  urged  to  this  step  by 
any  feding  of  resentment  in  consequence  of  the  injuries  done 
roe  in  Rome  by  certain  of  your  ministers,  as  if  I  wished  to 
avengv  mysdf  tbns  for  the  hundred  days  during  wliich,  in  the 
k»t  jetr,  I  was  shut  up  in  the  Inquisition  without  any  just 
canse.  May  God  pardon  you  your  offences  as  entirely  as  I 
pardoo  yoo  thtt  atJt,  though  it  brought  upon  me  heavy  sufferings ! 
I  have  ben  enabled  to  doive  benefit  from  it;  and  that  which 
by  you  wis  deeigned  for  my  injury,  the  all-wise  God  has  turned 
to  my  advantage.    So  that  now,  reckoning  up  my  account,  I 


150  APPENDIX. 

find  that  far  greater  than  my  loss  has  been  my  g-ain ;  that  my 
sorrow  has  been  turned  into  joy;  that  the  plot  has  turned 
ag^ainst  the  plotters,  to  whom  nothing  has  remained  but  the 
remorse  of  the  attempt  and  the  shame  of  a  miserable  result. 

Holy  Father,  if  you  really  fear  God,  you  know  suflSciently 
that  He  is  not  to  be  trifled  with — in  other  words,  one  cannot  lie 
to  Him,  nor  purpose  one  thing;  and  say  another.  Allow  me, 
then,  now  to  summon  you  into  His  presence  to  discuss  your  faith 
and  my  own ;  for  we  are  both  equal  before  Him ;  the  DecalogTie 
and  the  Gospel  are  equally  imposed  upon  us  both.  Excepting- 
these,  I  know  no  other  law  to  direct  me  in  my  belief  and  in  my 
actions ;  and  my  persuasion  is,  that  there  should  be  no  other  for 
any  one  who  would  call  himself  a  Christian. 

Tell  me,  I  pray  you,  whence  you  derive  those  of  your  dogmas 
which  exist  not  in  the  Gospel,  and  those  numerous  doctrines 
which  are  not  to  be  found  in  any  book  of  the  Scripture  ?  I  am 
entitled  to  ask  you;  for,  after  examining-  yom*  lauded  foim- 
tains  of  tradition,  your  theologians,  and  the  Fathers,  so  dis- 
honestly edited, — I  have  found  superabundant  fraud,  both  in 
interpretation,  assertion,  supposition,  and  inference ;  ibr  all 
seems  to  be  concentrated  in  the  object  of  making-  the  Pope 
universal  Sovereign,  establishing  him  as  head  and  lord  of  the 
entire  Church,  with  full  and  absolute  power  of  loosing  and 
binding — that  is,  of  destroying  and  building  up, — declaring-  his 
Church,  as  a  spiritual  kingdom,  superior  to  every  State,  to  every 
people,  to  every  dynasty ;  so  that,  according  to  this  theory,  the 
power  of  the  Pope  is  made  to  absorb  every  other  power, 
from  that  of  God  Himself,  who  alone  in  other  times  judged 
men  to  Hfe  or  to  perdition,  down  to  that  of  the  lowest  baron, 
who  can  only  have  from  the  Pope  the  legitimate  power  over  his 
vassals. 

Such  fables  might  be  told  in  the  happy  times  of  Gregory  VII.; 
and  then  it  was  that  they  were  coined,  with  the  design  of  ex- 
tending the  Papal  mantle  over  the  whole  world,  subjecting  to 
him,  as  far  as  possible,  the  kingdoms  of  Europe  and  Asia. 
Such  was  the  design  of  the  Crusades.  Such  was  the 
object  of  the  foundation  of  the  numerous  Orders,  —  a  race 
enrolled,    under    various    devices,    for    the    purposes    of    the 


FIRST  LETTBR  TO  ORBOORY  XVI.  151 

Poptti,  and  sent  to  the  most  remote  countries  to  preach, 
together  with  the  Gospel,  the  primacy,  the  sovereigfnty,  the 
infalhble,  irresistible,  fearful  omni{)otence  of  the  Most  Holy 
Bishop  of  Rome;  under  pain,  if  they  did  not,  of  being* 
aeverelj  paniahed,  and  with  the  certainty,  if  they  did,  of 
being  rewarded,  after  death,  with  the  honours  of  the  altar. 
Hi«torj,  Holy  Father,  teaches  us  this  whenever  we  read  it  with 
the  necessary  discernment.  These  Orders,  however,  increased, 
spread,  and  were  laden  by  Rome  with  privileges,  exemptions,  and 
even  riches;  for  the  monks,  even  more  than  the  priests,  played  the 
Papal  game,  related  to  the  nations  the  holiness  of  the  Popes, 
how  the  Holy  Spirit  chose  them,  and  how  Christ  and  the  Virgin 
oonveraed  with  them  famiharly.  Happy  whoever  could  obtain 
an  Agnus  Dei  or  other  favour ;  for  an  Indulgence,  silver  and  gold 
were  spent  without  restraint.  Hence  the  immense  riche&lt;) 
which,  from  every  quarter,  showered  upon  Rome,  and  rendered 
the  Popes  proud,  their  cotuis  insolent,  their  city  the  most  beau- 
tiful in  the  world. 

l&gt;iit  times  changed;  that  is  to  say,  many  well-informed 
persons  amongst  the  faithful,  perceived  the  imposture  of  these 
■diers  of  Christ;  and  first  with  words,  afterwards  by  acts, 
revoIt«Hl  against  the  disorder  which  not  only  bUnded  them  with 
error,  but  spoiled  and  oppressed  them.  And  now  came  the 
epoch  of  the  Reformation^-of  that  religious  rising  which,  excited 
by  God,  and  guided  by  the  Spirit  of  the  Lord,  succeeded  in 
oiligfatening  and  persuading  half  Europe  to  separate  from  the 
theories  of  Popery,  without  fear  of  otTending  religion, — nay, 
doing  justice  to  that  Gospel  which  the  Popes  had  adulterated, 
which  Rome  had  profaned,  which  had  been  made  an  instrument 
of  extortion  and  of  falsehood  by  the  aid  of  priests  and  monks. 
Bnt  this  lesson,  honestly  given  to  them  by  the  nations,  was  not 
enough  to  omrect  the  Popes :  the  half  of  their  proselytes  who 
fwiurfned  to  them  were  sufficient  to  maintaiu  their  courts  in  all 
fhetr  hixury  ;  and  one  hope  comforted  them,  that  by  the  use  of 
good  artifices,  the)r  might  destroy  the  work  of  Luther  and  of 
Henry  VHL,  as  they  bad  done  so  many  others. 

Holy  Father,  how  has  this  hope  for  three  centuries  failed 
you !    Nay,  yon  yourself  have  had  the  grief  of  losing  several 


152  APPENDIX. 

districts  which  called  themselves  yours,  in  the  north  and  in  the 
south,  without  any  hope  that  they  will  ever  return  to  you  ag-ain. 
And  the  reason,  if  you  wish  to  know  it,  I  can  tell  you, 
without  leaving  it  to  others.  It  is  because  these  our  times  are 
no  longer  in  accordance  with  the  impostures  that  you  sell  by 
means  of  your  monks,  who,  full  of  ignorance  and  superstition, 
still  hawk  about  the  fables  of  Rome.  The  world  will  no  longer 
listen  to  your  universal  primac}'-,  because  every  one  knows  that 
this  does  not  extend  beyond  the  two  millions  and  a  half  of 
people,  which,  by  the  deference  of  the  sovereigns  of  Em'ope,  it 
is  still  permitted  you  to  govern  by  force  of  arms.  Your  indul- 
gences, your  reKcs  are  specifics  for  the  soul  which  are  gone  out 
of  use.  The  excise  upon  sins,  which  you  enforce  once  a-year  to 
be  paid  through  your  privileged  exactors,  be  assured  that  the 
generality  pay  you  in  false  money  j  inasmuch  as  now  nearly 
every  one  comprehends  that,  however  great  may  be  the  authority 
you  possess,  that  power  assuredly  is  wanting  to  you  which  is 
proper  to  God  alone.  Still,  it  is  to  be  bitterly  lamented,  that  a 
great  part  of  Europe  still  tolerates  that  trickery  of  yours — a 
spectacle  revolting  to  the  good  sense,  not  to  say  to  the  religion, 
of  mankind — that  a  juggler  should  boast  of  being  able  to  trans- 
form, by  virtue  of  certain  words,  a  portion  of  bread  and  wine 
into  Deity.  Too  great,  0  Holy  Father,  too  great  is  the  abuse 
attempted  to  be  practised  on  your  adherents,  placing  them  in  the 
very  condition  of  those  who  were  once  taught  that  gods  might 
be  born  in  a  garden.  Why  so  far  outrage  your  friends  as  to 
make  them  afterwards  ashamed  of  themselves  when  they  come 
to  reflect  upon  the  fraud  ?  It  makes  them  hate  and  curse  you 
when  this  happens.  In  these  our  days,  when  not  even  children 
love  to  be  deceived,  men  have  sufficient  self-love  sooner  to  bear 
blows  than  to  be  treated  with  fraud  and  delusion. 

And  do  you  know  what  follows  ?  The  gravest  of  all  evils — 
the  total  loss  of  religion.  Roman  Catholics,  if  they  are  not  quick 
in  taking  refiige  in  some  reform  or  other,  become  Atheists,  at 
the  firet  moment  that  having  their  eyes  open  they  perceive  that 
tliey  have  been  drawn  into  such  gross  errors.  They  feel  an 
indignation  wliich  makes  them  discredit  everj'thing,  believing 
that  there  can  be  nothing  good  where  so  many  evil  things  are 


flBST  LBTTBR  TO  ORBGORY  XVI.  153 

presented  to  them  to  swallow.  Jnst  as,  when  in  a  most  ex- 
quisite dish  we  find  foreign  sabstanoes  which  offend  our 
senses,  we  do  not  set  ourselves  to  separate  them,  but  rather 
reject  the  whole ;  so  it  happens  to  Papi^its  when  they  perceive 
the  fidsity  and  fmnd  which  lies  hidden  under  the  Roman  faith. 
To  whoever  bids  them  to  beUeve,  tliey  reply  with  that  very 
phrase  which  we  ourselves  should  use,  to  any  who  presenting  us 
with  an  exquisite  dish  mixed  with  garbage  should  bid  us  to  eat. 

What  now  will  you  say,  Holy  Father,  if  I  prove  to  you  that 
by  means  of  Popery  men  become  more  wicked,  and  are  so 
speculatively?  The  power  that  you  confer  of  absolving,  to 
whom  does  it  not  secure  pardon  ?  Who  is  there  that,  having 
fulfilled  that  rite  of  yours,  does  not  become  persuaded  that  he 
has  settled  his  accounts,  to  open  them  again  witli  equal  extra- 
\-aganoe  ?  Let  the  fact  convince  you.  Where  are  the  greatest 
numbers  of  robbers,  traitors,  adiUterers,  if  not  in  the  midst  of 
your  Catholics  ?  For  it  costs  them  nothing  to  cast  themselves 
at  the  feet  of  one  of  your  plenipotentiaries  to  cancel  every 
iniquity.  If  you  have  been  at  Naples,  you  know  of  whom  it  is 
tliat  the  churches  are  full,  who  it  is  that  beat  their  breasts 
before  the  altar,  who  are  those  that  weep  all  day  at  the  con- 
fessionals !  And  such  as  Naples  is,  such  are  all  the  other 
conntries  more  or  less  Papist. 

But  there  is  more  still  to  observe.  Who  are  generally  the 
most  wicked  persons  in  every  locaUty  ?  (I  am  speaking  only  of 
Italy,  indeed  only  of  Southern  Italy — a  country  emphatically 
Roman  Catholic.)  Forgive  me.  Holy  Father ;  but  it  is  a  matter 
of  fact, — ^priests  and  monks ;  whatever  iniquity,  wickedness, 
and  abomination  has  ever  existed  upon  the  earth,  you  will  find 
it  among  them.  Haughtiness,  luxury,  ambition,  pride, — where 
do  thej  most  aboond  7  In  your  temples.  Tliere  the  excessive 
love  of  money,  fiEdsehood,  fraud,  duplicity  cover  themselves  with 
a  sacred  veil,  and  are  almost  in  security  from  profane  censures. 
And,  oh !  how  g^reat  are  the  horrors  of  the  cloisters  (sepulckra 
dealbata)f  where  ignorance  and  superstition,  laziness,  indolence, 
calnmny,  qnarrels,  immorality  of  every  description,  not  only 
liv.-,  bat  reign.  The  moet  abominable  vicex,  long  banished  from 
nil  sxaety,  have  taken  refuge  there,  and  there  will  continue 


154  APPENDIX. 

miserably  to  dwell,  until  God,  outraged  by  tbem,  shall  rain 
down  upon  them  the  curse  of  Sodom  and  Gomorrah. 

Am  I  exaggerating  ?  or  do  not  you  yourself,  while  reading 
this  paragraph,  utter  the  sigh  of  sorrowing  conviction  ?  Well, 
but  who  are  to  be  blamed  for  such  evils  ?  Mankind,  you  will 
tell  me, 'evasively.  But  I  reply:  And  are  not  the  immense 
mass  of  Protestants  also  a  part  of  mankind,  who  live  quite 
differently,  and  who  are  honest  and  respectable?  Worshipping 
the  same  Deity,  followers  of  the  same  Gospel,  their  temples  are 
truly  the  house  of  prayer,  their  Sundays  the  Lord's-day,  their 
ministers  patterns  of  probity  and  morality.  Can  this  be  denied 
concerning  the  universal  Protestant  clergy  ?*  But  thousands  of 
accusations  can  be  most  justly  made  against  the  Roman  Catholic 
clergy.  Will  you  venture  to  deny  it  ?  You  must  first  hide  the 
episcopal  prisons  of  your  State,  and  numerous  other  places  of 
punishment  for  ecclesiastics ; — you  must  prevent  the  world  fiom 
knowing  of  the  Ergastoto  of  Corneto,  full  to  overflowing  with 
priests  and  monks,  whom  you  send  there  yotirself  when  they 
become  intolerable  to  you.  Find  me  anything  like  this  in 
Germany  or  in  England — countries  eminently  Protestant.  I 
have,  I  think,  proved  to  you,  that  your  Popery  renders  men 
more  wicked. 

It  follows,  from  what  has  been  said,  that  such  a  religion  is 
the  pest  of  society.  And  so  indeed  it  is,  as  that  which  conceals 
the  truth,  which  disfigures  the  Gospel,  which  promotes  error, 
which  favours  ignorance  and  bigotry.  Hence  comes  the  ruin  of 
poor  Italy,  which,  owing  to  this  religious  evil,  is  in  many  parts 
desert,  the  country  uncultivated,  the  commerce  pitiable.  Italy, 
once  the  queen  of  the  world,  is  now  the  servant  and  slave  of  the 
nations.  Kings  consulting  with  their  Confessors  how  best 
to  oppress  their  people !  Jesuits  restored  to  the  ascendant  ! 
Monks  continually  enriching  themselves !  And,  while  all  the 
rest  of  the  world  is  progressing,  Italy  alone  is  going  back  by 


•  When  Dr.  Achilli  wrote  this,  he  had  only  been  a  Protestant  a  year,  and  had 
not,  I  believe,  resided  in  a  Protestant  country.  The  contrast  between  Protestant

reawo  of  her  Popery,  which  degrades,  debases,  and  renders 
her  contemptible  in  the  sij^ht  of  God  and  man. 

Holy  Father,  are  you  grieved  by  wliat  I  say  ?  I  rejoice 
not  in  your  grief,  but  in  the  hope  that  your  grief  may  be 
tor  your  benefit.  It  rests  with  you,  if  you  will,  to  change  the 
syst»'m.  Be  not  ashamed  of  having  erred  till  now.  You  will 
l)f  the  lujin  of  the  age,  a  man  glorious  in  all  history,  you  will 
be  the  true  Apostle  of  Jesus  Christ,  if,  renouncing  the  vanity  of 
your  primacy  which  can  last  but  little  longer,  you  lay  down 
the  titles  and  the  dignities  which  do  not  belong  to  you.  You, 
better  than  any  other,  can  bring  back  in  ItiUy  the  religion 
of  Christ  to  its  purity,  taking  away  all  that  has  been  maliciously 
invented  to  despoil  the  faithful  for  the  profit  of  the  clergy. 
The  imposture  is  now  thoroughly  understood;  there  are  no 
longer  persons  who  believe  in  confession,  in  the  mass,  in  the 
suffrages  of  purgatory,  in  the  patronage  of  saints.  Your  indul- 
gences have  lost  all  their  credit;  your  excommunications  are 
totally  valuel^s;  your  bulls  and  canons  only  raise  a  smile. 

How  is  the  world  changed  in  regard  to  you !  Once  all 
Catholics,  even  the  least  earnest,  spoke  of  the  Pope  with  every 
respect.  Now  your  very  Court  speaks  ill  of  you.  Accusations 
against  yourself  personally,  which  circulate  through  the  world 
and  state  things  in  the  highest  degree  dishonourable,  originate 
with  Romans.  You  will  call  this  fact  the  work  of  Satan,  but 
I  must,  with  more  suitable  language,  call  it  the  hand  of  God, — 
that  terrible  hand  which  Is  preparing  your  punishment. 

It  has  happened  to  you  now  as  happened  three  centuries 
stnoe  to  Pope  Clement  VII.  Then  Germany  and  England 
divided  from  Rome  under  his  eyes.  Poland  and  Spain  are  about 
ilciing  the  same  thing  now  under  yours.  Hasten,  Holy  Father, 
to  accept  the  call  which  Heaven  makes  to  you.  Despise  not 
the  Toice  of  God,  as  your  ill-advised  predecessors  despised  it. 
Your  measure  is  now  full.  In  the  first  days  of  your  Pontificate 
you  mw  the  most  violent  revolution  which  ever  happened  in 
your  States, — a  sincere  expression  of  the  opinion  and  wishes  of 
every  ooe.  It  was  echoed  and  applauded  by  all  Italy.  Italy 
wishes  for  you  no  longer ;  Italy  no  longer  believes,  respects,  or 
loves  you.     It  was  requisite,  then,  for  the  Aastriaiis  to  interfere. 


156  APPENDIX. 

Will  they  interfere  ag-ain  another  time  ?     Or,  if  they  do,  will 
they  be  able  to  extinguish  the  flame  ? 

Hegard  not  who  it  is  who  gives  you  these  suggestions.  I 
am  less  hostile  to  you  than  you  think  me.  Nay,  I  protest  to 
you  that  I  have  no  hostility  in  my  heart  except  for  your  doctrine 
and  for  your  poHcy;  I  have  none  for  yourself,  whom  I  regard 
with  religious  affection,  and  for  whom  I  desire  the  holy  light 
of  God  in  order  to  your  repentance  and  that  of  your  brethren.

LETTER  11. 

TO  GHEGORY  XVI,, 

BiSfiOP   AND   SOVEKEIGN   OF   ROMB, 

GIACINTO  ACHILLI,  Minister  of  the  Italian  Catholic 
Chuech. 
It  is  not  party-spirit— it  is  not  a  craving  to  contend  with  you,— 
but  the  love  of  truth,  the  interests  of  rehgion  and  of  the  charity 
of  the  Gospel,  which  induce  me  to  write  to  you  again.  In  the 
Church  of  Jesus  Christ  it  has  ever  been  the  custom  for  the  elders 
to  treat  with  the  bishops  upon  the  most  important  matters. 
Thus  Jerome  did  with  Damasus,  and  Bernard  with  Eugenius. 
I  do  not  set  myself  up  as  a  judge.  I  only  wish  to  be  a  truthful 
witness  in  a  cause  where  there  are  a  thousand  accusers.  The 
issue  lies  between  you  and  the  Church — that  is,  between  the 
Christian  people  and  one  Bishop  of  Christendom.  No  question 
could  be  more  important,  from  the  subject  to  which  it  relates, 
the  parties  who  compose  it,  the  period  at  which  it  is  raised. 
The  subject  is  the  faith  of  the  Gospel,  the  only  law  given  to 
Christians.  The  parties  are  a  multitude  against  a  few,  a  people 
against  individuals,  the  Christian  Church  against  its  pretended 
lords.  The  period  is  the  nineteenth  century.  The  terms  of  the 
question  :  whether  a  whole  world  should  continue  to  believe  in 
you,  to  obey  you,  to  follow  you  wherever  you  are  pleased  to 
lead  it.  You  support  the  affirmative,  which  others  deny.  I 
will  openly  render  my  solemn  testimony. 


81C0ND  LETTER  TO  ORBOORY  XVI.  157 

The  Christian  world  will  no  longer  believe  in  you  becaxtse  you 
have  deceived  it,  and  becau.se  you  continue  in  your  intention  of  de- 
c»»iving'  it.  It  believed  you  as  lonjj  as  you  announced  the  truths 
ot  ivligion  as  they  are  written  in  the  book  of  the  common  faith. 
To  you,  more  instructed  than  others,  it  gave  the  faculty  of 
exphiining  to  it  tlie  mysteries  of  charity,  the  symbols  of  the 
Divine  Word.  Your  speech  should  have  been  simple  and  pure, 
bat  you  adulterated  it  with  false  doctrines,  with  fallacious 
argfument^,  with  senses  extorted  from  the  philosophy  of  the 
Pagans, — ^you  explained  the  Gospel  by  the  theories  of  Plato  and 
the  sophistries  of  Aristotle.  The  world  no  longer  knows  what  to 
believe.  Your  Doctors  have  exalted  themselves  above  the  Apos- 
tles; they  perverted  in  theur  language  the  holy  expressions  of  those 
Epistles  which  men  of  God  left  for  tlie  instruction  of  the  faithful. 
A  new  Word  prevailed  over  the  old — an  earthly  and  human  over 
the  heavenly  and  Divine.  The  faith,  the  patrimony  of  a  free 
people,  was  made  over  to  a  caste  which  domineered  over  the 
people.  The  property  of  the  simple  was  usurped  by  the  cunning ; 
the  inheritance  of  the  poor  of  Jesus  Christ,  was  extorted  from 
them  by  the  rich,  who  clad  in  purple  and  gold  disdained  the 
title  of  brethren  and  friends — the  only  appellation  of  Christians — 
and  chose  instead  to  be  called  fathers  and  lords.  And  the 
people  was  deceived  by  them.  Yes,  the  people,  which  is 
the  Chiurch,  deceived  by  the  ministers  of  a  reUgion  which  knows 
nothing  but  the  |)eople,  which  is  only  given  to  the  people — by 
which,  whosoever  aspires  to  be  the  first,  is  condemned  to  be  the  last, 
— the  people  who,  as  St.  Peter  says,  "  lajong  aside  all  malice, 
and  all  guile,  and  evil  speaking,  as  newborn  babes,  desire  the 
sincere  milk  of  the  Word,  in  order  to  grow  thereby,  after 
having  tasted  that  the  Lord  is  gracious :  to  whom  coming,  as  to 
a  living  stone,  disallowed  indeed  of  men,  but  chosen  of  God  and 
predons,  they  are  built  up  as  living  stones,  a  spiritual  bouse, 
an  holy  priesthood,  to  offer  up  spiritual  sacrifices  acceptable 
unto  God  bj  Jesns  Christ.  ...  a  chosen  generation,  a  royal 
priesthood,  an  holy  nation,  a  pecnhar  people,  which  in  time  past 
was  not  a  people,  but  now  are  the  people  of  God;  which  had  not 
obtained  mercy,  bat  now  have  obtained  mercy ;" — yes,  the  people, 
deceived  by  ypo,  has  good  reason  no  longer  to  believe  in  you.  You 


158  APPENDIX. 

have  deceived  it  with  your  doctrines — yours,  and  not  those  of  the 
Gospel ;  invented  for  your  profit  alone,  not  for  the  benefit  of  men's 
souls,  to  which  you  have  even  denied  consolation  when  they  could 
not  give  you  silver  and  gold.  You  have  deceived  it,  too,  with  your 
practices,  when 3^ou,  so  avaricious, preached  disinterestedness ;  you, 
so  impure,  chastity ;  you,  so  vindictive,  pardon ;  you,  so  insubordi- 
nate, submission ;  you,  so  turbulent,  peace  j  you,  so  self-indulgent, 
temperance ;  you,  so  indolent,  industry;  you,  so  immoral,  holiness. 
Thus  to  this  day  you  have  deceived  the  people ;  and  the  people 
has  ceased  to  believe  in  you,  perceiving  that  God  did  not 
dwell  in  you,  that  God  no  longer  spoke  through  your 
untnitbful  lips.  How,  indeed,  could  they  longer  believe  in  you, 
when  the  Word  of  God  was  in  open  contradiction  with  your 
words — its  principles  with  your  institutions  ?  God,  who  pardons 
him  that  believes — you,  who  declare  none  absolved  but  those 
who  work  !  God,  who  will  be  worshipped,  by  believers,  in  spirit 
and  in  truth,  who  prohibits  sculptures  and  images,  so  that  no 
one  may  ever  perform  worship  and  homage  to  another— and 
you?  Oh,  how  many  things  have  you  taught,  how  many 
divers  practices  have  you  adopted !  How  have  you  changed 
the  temple  of  praj^er,  the  mystic  tahle  of  the  Lord's  Supper, 
the  simple  hymn  of  the  faithful,  the  pure  preaching  of  the 
Word  ?  Who  ever  saw  in  the  ancient  churches — who  could  have 
anticipated  in  the  new  ones,  the  golden  ornaments  of  yoiir  sacer- 
dotal crowns  and  vestments  ?  so  that  there  is  no  part  of  the 
person  which  on  solemn  days  does  not  shine  in  the  temple 
like  a  sim,  to  which  the  almost  dazzled  eyes  of  a  deluded 
multitude  of  disciples  are  turned,  substituting,  alas!  the 
senses  for  spirit,  earth  for  heaven,  man  for  Deity?  Fatal 
illusion,  which  has  caused  such  great  evils  throughout 
Christendom!  these  appearances  being  supposed  to  be  faith, 
and  in  these  rehgion  being  made  to  consist.  Deny  it  if 
you  can.  What  is,  in  fact,  the  faith  of  the  people,  and 
what  must  it  be  from  your  practical  instruction?  That,  of 
course,  which  it  sees  and  hears  with  you.  And  what  else 
does  it  see  and  hear  but  superstitions  and  eiTors?  To  wliom 
are  the  solemn  days  dedicated?  To  the  saints.  Concerning 
whom  are  the   most  glowing  orations  made   oflenest   in   the 


BIOOND  LBTTBR  TO  ORBGORT  XVL  159 

Churches  ?  Th«  saints.  Who  is  over  the  altars  ?  A  saint  at  full 
length,  with,  or  perhaps  without,  a  small  crucifix  scarcely  vii^ible. 
Which  waj  does  the  people  turn  on  entering  the  temple  /  There 
where  it  tees  in  image  exciting  to  its  feelings.  And  what 
foUovs?  The  people  worship  it.  And  you,  spectators  of  this 
supentition  ?  You  are  silent.  And  you  are  consistent  in  being 
silent,  for  noue  but  yourselves  deserve  to  be  blamed  for  this 
ftboM, — you,  who  place  the  image  there — you,  who  relate  its 
miracles  so  as  to  enamour  witli  it  the  simple  who  trust  you !  You 
are  silent  also  because  it  is  yoiur  interest.  Oblations,  g^fts; 
offimngs  fbUow  the  adoration.  It  may  be  asked, — Is  not  the 
people  deluded?  What  luattt^rs  it,  if  only  the  priesthood  be 
profited ! 

The  people  will  not  believe  itself  deluded,  doing  what  it  sees 
you  do.  Who  of  you  does  not  adore  the  saints,  does  not  adore 
and  kiss  their  reUcs?  It  is  no  use  to  ui^e  the  distinction 
about  sorts  of  worship  which  is  made  by  you  in  the  schools. 
The  people  know  not  it,  because  they  have  never  been  taught 
it.  It  is  shut  up  in  your  books,  from  whence  it  never  comes 
out,  except  to  be  learnt  by  those  who  have  to  support 
and  defend  it  against  every  attack.  In  short,  it  is  the  doctrine 
of  controversy,  not  of  practice.  If  you  ordered  the  practice, 
you  would  prohibit  kneeling  before  images  and  relics ;  but  you 
are  the  first  to  kneel.  You  would  not  permit  the  use  of 
incense,  practi««Hi  from  antiquity  in  honour  of  God  alone ;  but 
it  b  you  who  offer  inoenae  to  relics  and  images.  You  would  not 
tolerate  even  the  candles  on  the  altar,  which  inspire  the  people 
with  a  high  idea  of  the  majesty  of  God ;  but  you  light  them 
yourselvea.  You  come  upon  us  with  the  distinction  of  the  school, 
between  the  worship  and  adoration  of  images.  Who  are  you 
who  dara  to  dutinguish  where  the  law  precludes  all  distinction  ? 
It  »  Ood  who  says  in  the  second  commandment,  ^*  Thou  shalt 
not  make  unto  thee  any  graTen  image,  or  any  Ukeness  of  any 
thing  that  is  in  bearen  above,  or  that  is  in  the  earth  beneath : 
Thoo  shalt  not  bow  down  thyself  to  them,  nor  serv^  them." 
(Exodus  XX.,  Deut.  v.)  But  yon  hare  purposely  taken  this 
commaadmaot  out  of  your  decalogue,  dividing  the  last  into  two 
to  oonpleto  the  number  ten. 


160  APPENDIX. 

Need  I  remind  you  of  all  the  other  inventions  by  which  you 
have  deceived  the  people,  making'  them  believe  that  you  have 
found  them  in  the  Scriptures,  and  that  they  have,  moreover,  the 
suffrage  of  a  constant  tradition  within  the  Church  ?  The  people, 
having  now  learnt  to  read,  take  the  Bible  in  their  hands,  and 
look  for  your  doctrines  in  it.  Where,  they  ask,  is  the  precept 
for  auricular  confession,  of  which  the  Church  of  Rome  makes  an 
express  command,  and  has  declared  it  a  Sacrament?  Not  a 
word  of  it  can  be  found  in  the  Gospel,  nor  the  slightest  allusion 
in  the  letters  of  the  Apostles.  '  But  perhaps  some  Christians  of 
the  early  times  practised  it  ?  For  four  centuries  they  did  not 
even  know  it  by  name,  and  when  it  began  to  spring  up,  it  found 
more  opponents  than  followers,  no  one  even  venturing  to  reduce 
it  into  a  precept.  The  people  seek  in  the  Bible  the  famous 
doctrine  of  purgatory,  and  how  groat  their  sui-prise  to  find  that 
Jesus  Christ,  who  brought  life  and  immortahty  to  light,  with 
the  double  eternity  of  rewards  and  punishments,  neither  himself 
nor  his  Apostles  has  ever  mentioned  purgatory. 

You  send  them  to  read  a  sentence  of  the  Book  of  the 
Maccabees,  and  wish  Judas  IMaccabeus  to  teach  the  Christian 
people  what  Jesus  Christ  did  not  teach.  But  the  people,  who 
are  not  wanting  in  sense,  ask  their  priests  what  is  the  value  of 
that  Book  of  Maccabees  ?  The  conscientious  priest  is  obliged  to 
reply  that  it  is  one  of  the  Apocryphal  books,  having  never  been 
received  by  the  Hebrews,  from  whom  we  are  bound  to  receive 
faithfully  the  books  of  the  Old  Testament ;  not  written  origin- 
ally in  their  language ;  never  quoted,  either  by  Christ,  or  by 
His  Apostles,  consequently,  not  received  in  the  ancient  Catholic 
Church,  and  only  inserted  among'  the  sacred  books  by  the 
Council  of  Trent,  to  whom  it  was  an  object  to  authenticate  the 
doctrine  of  purgatory.  So  much  for  the  Scripture  proof  Now, 
let  us  go  to  the  tradition  of  the  ancient  Catholic  Church.  You 
will  admit  that,  for  two  centuries,  prayers  for  the  dead,  and  still 
more  the  doctrine  of  purgatory,  never  entered  men's  heads. 
TertuUian,  that  imaginative  mind,  which  saw  so  many  other 
things  upside  down,  was  the  first  to  recommend  prayers  for  the 
dead,  without,  however,  mentioning  purgntory.  Towards  the 
end  of  the  fourth  century,  Augustine,  another  African  mind, 


81C0MD  LBTPBR  TO  QRBOORT  XVI.  1  H  1 

xpt^e  mon  deddedlj  both  of  prayers,  and  of  a  sort  of  snfTmges 
fur  the  daad.  Howevw  others  choose  to  do  so,  shall  we  rely 
on  the  anthority  of  his  discoveries?  Even  the  purgatory  of 
Augustine  was  not  an  existing  fire,  but  one  which  is  to  be 
lighted  up  at  the  final  destruction,  through  which  then,  and 
not  prerioualy,  Mmb  shall  pais.  This  theory  is  of  perhaps  equal 
nJne  with  his  theory  about  the  Antipodes,  whose  existence  that 
leaned  man  denied! 

And  as  with  this,  so  with  all  the  other  dogmas  wliich, 
since  the  time  of  Orrery  YIL,  have  originated  in  the  Church 
of  Rome.  Is  the  Christian  Church  bound  to  receive  the  wicked 
inventioos  of  Uooorius  III.,  proposed  and  sanctioned  by  him 
in  the  Leteran  Council  (1215)?  Shall  she  adhere  to  his 
famous  dogma  of  tnutsubetantiation,  invented  by  the  heretic 
Eutychus,  unknown  in  the  first  ages,  and  powerfully  contra- 
dicted by  Pope  Galatius?  (Be  Zhtab.  Christ.  Natur.)  Can 
she  abide  by  that  impious  doctrine  that  the  sacrifice  of  Christ, 
oflered  once  for  all  as  a  full  satisfaction  even  to  the  end  of  the 
worid,  should  be  renewed  every  day  by  hundreds,  by  thousands, 
by  hundreds  of  thousands  of  priests,  who  say  that  they  are  author- 
ised to  oAer  it,  both  for  the  Uving  and  the  dead  ?  Most  enor- 
moiis  saeri^e,  to  which  the  whole  Bible  is  opposed,  and  which 
the  Apoetle  Paul  loudly  condemns  in  his  epistles !  Which  of 
the  elders,  or  bishojts,  in  the  first  centuries,  ever  allowed  himself 
to  edebrate  your  mass,  or  the  sacrifice  which  you  call  imbloody, 
or  to  make  use  of  anything  but  the  simple  commemoi-ation  of  the 
8upper  of  the  Lord,  a  thousand  miles  off  from  tliat  idea  with  which 
you  have  clothed  it  in  the  ages  of  error  and  ignorance  ?  Is  that 
which  you  celebrate  now  the  original  august  mystery  of  the  Divine 
food,  instituted  indeed  in  substances  of  bread  and  wine,  but  con- 
taining spiritually  the  body  and  blood  of  Christ;  which  are  com- 
mnniettted  to  His  Church,  that  is,  to  the  multitude  of  behevers,  not 
materially  and  physically,  as  you  say,  but  in  virtue  of  faith  ?  Yes ! 
if  you  will  but  celebrate  it  witli  that  simplicity  with  which  it  was 
celebrated  by  the  fiM  bishops  and  elders  of  the  catholic  Church,  we 
wiU  come  willingly  to  receive  it  at  your  haiuh.  Celebrate  it  in  all 
its  extent,  and  the  people  will  approach  the  eucharistic  table,  to 
feed  on  the  Dirine  bread,  and  to  drink  the  Divme  cup.     liut  the 

K 


162  APPENDIX. 

people  desire  both  the  one  and  the  other,  and  cannot  yet  under- 
stand the  reason  for  which  you  have  taken  half  from  them.  Is 
it  not  the  precept  of  Christ  that  every  believer  should  drink 
of  that  cup  as  well  as  eat  of  that  bread  ?  Was  not  this  the 
practice  of  the  primitive  times  of  Christianity?  Look  to  the  Greek 
Churcb;  how  it  has  always  retained  that  practice,  and  how  the 
Reformation  immediately  resumed  it.  The  people  have  a  right 
to  the  cup  as  have  you  priests ; — even  better  than  you,  since 
you  cannot  avail  yourselves  of  it  without  that  which  is  properly 
the  Church.  When  you  take  it  alone,  you  perform  an  act  con- 
trary to  His  institution,  which  is  to  "communicate" — that  is,  to 
take  it  together,  as  the  word  itself  teaches  you.  Yes  !  Only  on 
this  condition  will  the  people  remain  united  to  you,  that  you  ai-e 
faithful  in  the  exercise  of  the  ministry,  not  altering  the  faith,  not 
changing  the  practice,  not  deceiving  them  in  anything. 

They  are  willing  to  confide  in  you  as  the  appointed  ser- 
vants of  the  Church  in  the  offices  of  religion.  But  instead 
of  this  you  think  of  nothing  but  to  command.  The  yoke 
of  Christ  which  He  made  easy,  and  His  burden  which  He 
made  light,  you  have  rendered  so  heavy  and  insupportable  that 
the  people  refuse  to  bear  it.  Something  very  different  from 
indulgences  and  benedictions  is  needed  to  attract  the  people. 
In  the  present  day  fables  please  none  but  children,  and  lies  are 
no  longer  tolerated  by  any.  The  Christian  people  desire  from 
us,  ministers  of  its  Church,  the  Word  of  Life  such  as  it  was 
announced  by  Jesus  Christ,  such  as  the  Apostles  preached, 
such  as  is  written  in  the  sacred  books  of  our  faith.  If,  instead 
of  chaplets  and  Agnus  Dei's,  which  are  deceptions,  you, 
Bishop  of  Rome,  were  to  give  the  Bible  to  the  people,  you 
would  then  see  how  they  would  follow  you !  But  it  must  be 
the  Bible  translated  into  their  own  language,  so  that  they  may 
comprehend  it.  Give  them  the  Bible  !  Bestow  on  them  those 
sacred  books  which  Moses  and  the  Prophets,  the  Evangelists 
and  the  Apostles  wrote  for  the  people  and  not  only  for  the  priests ! 
Give  the  people  that  which  is  their  own ;  they  have  a  right  to 
it  which  you  cannot  take  from  them.  It  is  the  testament  of  a 
God  who  left  His  people  tlie  heirs  of  His  holy  Word,  in  tlie 
reading  of  which  faith  will  be  granted,  and  to  the  belief  of  which 


I

ooea,  and  i*^"«""y  a  corse  to  fall  upon  you.  You  venture 
to  etoonuiiiiBkato  the  people,  if  they  read  the  Bibles  vrhich 
a  beneficent  Christian  society  has  taken  pains  to  print  in  all 
fangvagea  on  purpose  that  all  nations  may  enjoy  the  benefit 
of  reading  it.  Yoa  condemn  the  charity  and  the  reUgion  of 
tfaoee  good  men,  who,  in  their  seal  for  souls,  undertake  this 
work  with  much  expense  to  themsdves!  0  Po|)e  Gregory, 
what  manner  of  spirit  are  you  of?  As  one  of  the  bishops  of 
Chriatendom  jou  should  have  a  care  to  feed  your  flock ;  and  on 
what  will  joa  feed  them,  if  not  on  the  pure  and  holy  Word  of 
God  ?  YoQ  ought,  therefore,  to  be  well  disposed  towards  who- 
ever takee  this  Word  from  the  holy  originals  in  Hebrew  and 
Gre^,  and  fiuthfully  tnmslates  it  into  the  vulgar  tongue,  so  as 
to  enable  yqu  and  other  bishops  to  administer  it  to  your  flocks. 
Yoa  ought  yoarself  to  accept  these  sacred  volumes  from  their 
hands,  and,  aooompanying  them  with  the  warmest  expressions  of 
paternal  solicitude,  recommend  them  to  the  reading  and  the 
•todj  of  joar  children.  What  do  I  say  ?  You  ought  on  your 
own  aoooont  to  print  them,  and  not  wait  for  others  to  supply 
yoa  with  them.  You  would  then  see  the  faithful  in  your 
Church  throw  themadTca  eagerly  upon  that  Divine  book,  and 
draw  fiom  it  food  and  noorishment.  But,  alas !  you  do  just 
the  oppoaite.  You  do  not  print  it,  and  you  do  not  choose  that 
others  ahoold  print  it.  You  never  give  it  to  the  people,  and 
yon  do  not  wish  that  others  should  give  it.  I  will  odd  what 
I  bear  «nd^— you  do  not  read,  and  you  do  not  wish  that 
otben  ahoald  rand  il.  And  for  this  you  allege,  as  your  sole 
reason,  the  pntezt  that  the  peo|)le  are  not  capable  of  under- 
standing it  Truly,  they  do  not  understand  it  in  Latin ;  but 
tbej  would  understand  it  in  their  own  language.  The  Germans 
and  the  RngHsh,  to  whom  their  own  Churches  impart  it,  do 
understand  it ;  why  should  it  not  be  understood  by  the  French, 
tlip  Ttalums,  and  the  Spaniards  f 

ly,  in  yoar  Encyclical  of  Ust  March,  that  the  Council 
id  order  to  expUun  the  Bible  to  the  people,  provides 
k2 


164  ArrENDix. 

that  in  each  cathedral  church  there  should  be  a  canon  charged 
to  deliver,  during  each  year,  certain  lectures  on  the  Scri[)tures. 
And  think  you  that  this  is  enough  ?  I  know  of  this  provision, 
and  I  know,  too,  how  it  is  practised.  Would  that  this  were 
done  in  all  the  cathedrals,  and  that  the  number  of  lectures 
amounted  to  twenty  in  a  year!  But,  let  me  ask  you,  has  every 
village  its  cathedral  and  its  theologians  charged  with  lectures 
on  the  Scripture?  Away  with  such  excuses!  why  abuse  the  inex- 
j)erienced  with  illusive  words,  wliich  only  mock  the  people.  The 
iact  is,  you  do  not  wish  that  the  Scriptures  should  be  read,  still 
less  read  aloud,  by  any  one  who  having  no  interest  in  flattering 
you  woidd  go  to  them  in  order  to  investigate  your  doctrines.  Those 
humble  souls,  to  whom  the  Lord  would  reveal  the  knowledge  which 
He  denies  to  your  theologians,  would  find  in  them  the  falsity  of 
your  system ;  instead  of  beheving  in  you,  they  would  begin  to 
believe  in  Jesus  Christ,  who  announces  to  his  people  salvation 
by  faith,  and  not  by  works ;  remission  of  sins  to.  sinners  by 
grace,  and  not  by  penance;  satisfaction  by  the  merits  of  Jesus 
Ciirist,  and  not  by  those  of  good  men  ;  Jesus  Christ  the  sole 
Mediator  with  God,  not  the  Virgin  and  the  saints ;  Christ  the 
Head  and  Chief  of  the  Church,  not  Peter  and  not  you ;  Christ 
alone  perfectly  holy,  Christ  alone  infallible.  These,  and  other 
such  things,  the  people  would  find  in  the  Bible,  if  they  read  it. 
And  the  consequence  would  be,  that  the  people  being  the 
many,  finding  themselves  deceived  by  you  who  are  the  few, 
would  summon  you  to  judgment  for  having  too  long  kept  them 
in  error,  to  the  serious  injury  of  religion  as  well  as  to  the 
danger  of  their  own  souls.  Think  you  that,  then,  the  antiquity 
of  dates,  the  traditions  of  canons,  or  the  authority  of  the  Fathers 
woidd  serve  to  defend  your  cause?  The  people  with  the 
Bible  in  their  hands,  after  having  confuted  your  errora  and 
tliose  of  your  Councils  and  of  your  Fathers,  who  all  being  unin- 
spired men  were  but  too  liable  to  err,  as  in  fact  they  did  en- — 
the  people  would  pronounce  such  a  sentence  as  would  oblige 
you  and  your  theologians  to  return  to  the  Bible,  that  is,  to  the 
true  catholic  Church  of  the  three  first  centuries,  reforming,  by 
this  means,  what  has  been  added  since,  whether  by  the  desire  of 
novelty,  or  by  the  sj)irit  of  ambition  and  interest.   "

Do  Yoa  know  what  the  people  is  ?  It  is  the  Ghnrch  of  Jesus 
Clirist.  We  are  the  ministers,  that  Is  to  say,  the  servants  of 
this  Church ;  and  we  therefore  depend  upon  the  people.  This 
truth,  announced  by  Jesus  Christ,  and  openly  taught  by  His 
Apoetlea,  but  which  men  have  wilfully  denied,  begins  now  to 
reviTe.  The  people,  whom  it  has  been  attempted  to  deprive  of 
thflir  prirfleges,  now  begin  to  reclaim  them.  The  man  who  now 
reads  in  his  own  language  the  Epistles  of  St.  Peter  and  St. 
Paul,  discovers  there  his  own  privileges,  reflects  on  the  usurpation 
which  hasbeen  practised  upon  him,  and  claims' what  he  is  entitled 
to.  The  people  as  constituting  the  Church,  to  which  the  ministers 
are  servants  in  the  dispensation  of  mysteries  and  in  the  office 
of  pmching,  will  then  have  the  help  of  Christ,  even  to  the 
end  of  the  world.  On  this  People-Church  descended  the  pro- 
mises of  the  Redeemer,  and  we  only  participate  in  them  as  part 
of  the  people,  as  ministers  of  the  people. 

Bishop  of  Rome!  continue,  if  you  will,  to  sit  as  long  as 
men  will  let  you  on  the  throne  of  the  Csesars,  who  are  dead ; 
but  invade  not  that  of  Jesus  Christ,  who  lives  and  reigns.  He  is 
the  only  Sovereign  of  the  People-Church,  nor  does  He  allow 
Himself  to  be  represented  by  others.  He  governs  it  at  all  times 
with  His  own  laws,  nor  does  He  suffer  others  to  usurp  His  rights 
by  subetituting  their  own  laws  for  His. 

And  does  it  follow  that  He  must  be  longer  silent,  be- 
cause he  has  borne  with  you  in  silence  until  now  ?  It  is  now 
nearly  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  century.  Do  you  not  see 
the  providence  of  God  in  operation  over  all  material  and  earthly 
things  ?  When  was  there  ever  such  progress  in  enlightenment, 
such  knowledge  of  the  arts  of  industry  ?  Remote  nations 
approach  each  other  by  the  easiest  means,  connect  themselves 
in  the  meet  rapid  manner,  and  form  plans  for  a  degree  of  union, 
of  peace,  and  of  proeperi^,  snch  as  has  never  before  existed. 
Nations  which  slept  for  ages,  have  woken  up  full  of  vigour  and 
enei^  ;  their  stepe  are  those  of  a  giant ;  their  look  is  that  of 
the  eagle ;  they  measure  the  earth  in  its  vastness,  and  overrun 
it  in  all  its  extent.  The  people  of  our  day  differ  widely  from 
tlios,.  of  bygone  times,  their  wants  are  more  strongly  felt,  their 
laoguage  is  more  decided.    la  former  timeS|  no  Roman  could

have  been  found  to  speak  to  his  Pope  with  frankness.  You 
have  now  found  one  who  spares  you  not,  who  dai-es  to 
present  himself  before  you,  not  on  his  knees  to  adore  you, 
but  upright,  to  speak  to  you  with  freedom  and  to  tell  you 
what  he  thinks.  And  along-  with  him  are  thousands,  nay 
millions,  who  partake  his  views.  And  who  is  this  man? 
An  Italian,  a  minister  of  an  Italian  Church  ; — a  Church  which 
assembles  to  pray  to  God  in  the  Italian  language,  and  to 
Hsten  to  the  reading  of  His  holy  Word.  And  in  whose  name 
does  he  minister?  In  that  of  God.  By  whom  chosen  and 
received  ?  By  the  people,  who  are  the  Church ;  and  previously  by 
yourself,  and  by  the  Church  of  the  priests.  If,  indeed,  that  Church 
of  yours  be  indeed  a  Church,  consisting,  as  it  does,  of  priests  only 
without  people.  You  are  called  the  Latin  Church,  but  where  is  the 
Latin  people  ?  From  the  time  that  the  language  of  the  priests  has 
ceased  to  be  that  of  the  people,  priests  and  people  no  longer 
form  one  Church ;  unless  by  the  word  Church  you  mean 
a  theatre,  with  a  stage  for  the  actors  and  a  space  for  the  spec- 
tators. The  country  from  the  Alps  to  the  sea  is  Italy ;  its  in- 
habitants are  called  by  all  the  world,  Italians;  its  language  is 
Italian,  and  has  been  so  for  four  centuries.  Where  is  there 
room  for  a  Latin  Church  ?  Such  did  exist  before  God  extin- 
guished it ;  but  God  has  extinguished  it,  and  man  cannot  main- 
tain it  in  existence. 

Yes,  Pope  Gregory,  Italians  we  are,  and  Christians  we  are 
resolved  to  be.  What  shall  be  the  name  of  our  Church? 
Answer,  or  the  people  will  answer  for  you,  "  the  Italian."  The 
Italian  Church  we  are,  by  the  will  of  God  and  in  the  name  of 
Jesus  Christ  who  presides  over  us.  Will  you  join  us?  You, 
too,  are  an  Italian.  You,  too,  are  a  Christian.  Nay,  you  are  a 
minister  and  an  elder,  as  St.  Peter  designated  himself;  and  among 
the  elders  we  will  recognise  you  as  a  bishop,  whenever  you 
will  return  with  us  to  the  Christianity  of  primitive  times ;  other- 
wise we  must  part.  Understand  that  in  religion  there  is  no 
compromise,  and  we  are  persuaded  that  the  religion  of  the 
first  three  centuries  is  alone  the  pure  and  true  Christianity. 
Can  you  deny  this?  You  are  a  conscientious  raun  ;  do  justice, 
then,  to  your  country,  since   the  providence  of  God  has  made

and  earth  will  contradict  jou ;  posterity  will  condemn  you ;  and  an 
Omnipotoit  God  will  pass  your  sentence,  dooming  you  to  be  the

LEHER  III. 

TO  PIUS  IJ., 
Bishop  ixd  Sovbrsiox  or  Romb, 

GIACINTO  ACHILLI,  a  Misistbb  or  tub  Italian  Cathouc 
Church. 

It  is  not  unknown  to  you  that  I  addressed  two  letters  to 
jour  exalted  predecessor,  Gregory  XYL,  making  a  full  retracta- 
ticm  of  the  Roman  doctrines  which  I  had  professed,  more  or  less, 
up  to  1841,  and  declaring  to  him  my  entire  belief  in  Divine 
Scripture  alone,  to  the  exclusion  of  everything  else.  In  this 
£uth  I  intend  to  live  and  die,  so  help  me  God  and  His  holy 
Word! 

Being  designated,  however,  by  the  will  of  the  Lord,  as  a 
minister  and  elder  in  His  Church,  I  could  not  abstain  fi-om  the 
exerdse  of  that  employment  without  entailing  upon  myself 
God's  vagit,  and  committing  a  culpable  desertion  of  duty.  My 
ministrj  is  oooseerated  to  the  Church  of  Jesus  Christ,  and  I  am 
deeply  impressed  with  the  obligation  of  fulfilling  my  vocation. 
^Hie  Pastor  and  Bishop  of  Souls"  gives  me  t)oth  the  command 
and  the  strength  to  discharge  my  duties.  The  Church,  which 
is  the  pec^ile,  calls  me  to  serve  it  I  must  be  faithful  to 
my  minislry,  rendering  good  account  of  the  charge  which  has 
been  entm^ed  to  me. 

I  have  been  bidden  to  keep  in  remembrance  "  that  true 
faith  which  is  in  me,**  and  "  to  keep  alive  that  gift  of  God  which 
is  in  me  by  the  imposition  of  hands,**  seeing  that  God  "  has  not 


168  APPENDIX. 

given  us  a  spii'it  of  fear,"  but  of  strength,  and  of  love,  and  of  a 
sound  mind.  Therefore,  "  I  must  not  be  ashamed  of  the  testimony 
of  our  Lord."  "  I  know  in  whom  I  have  beheved,  and  I  am 
persuaded  that  He  is  able  to  keep  that  which  I  have  committed 
unto  Him  against  that  day."  I  therefore  "  keep  the  form  of 
sound  words  which  I  have  heard,  in  faith  and  love  which 
is  in  Christ  Jesus."  "  I  keep  that  good  thing,  which  was  com- 
mitted unto  me  by  the  Holy  Ghost,  which  dwelleth  in  me."  I 
profess  before  God  and  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  "  to  preach  the 
Word,  to  be  instant  in  season  and  out  of  season,  to  reprove, 
rebuke,  exhort  with  all  long-suffering  and  doctrine."  I  purpose 
to  be  vigilant  in  everything,  "  to  endure  afflictions,  to  do  the 
work  of  an  evangelist,  to  make  full  proof  of  my  ministry." 

Such  being  my  office,  such  my  obligations,  here  I  stand 
before  you.  Holy  Father,  "  studying  to  show  myself  approved 
of  God,  a  workman  not  needing  to  be  ashamed,  dividing  rightly 
the  Word  of  Truth."  I  know  that  the  elders  who  have  per- 
formed well  the  duty  of  ruling  should  be  "reputed  worthy  of 
double  honour ;  especially  those  who  labour  in  the  Word  and  in 
doctrine."  You  are  the  elder  to  whom  was  recently  committed 
the  chai'ge  of  ruling  over  the  Church  of  our  country,  and  this 
charge  was  committed  to  you  by  other  elders,  who  divide 
amongst  them  the  various  offices  of  that  Church,  or  who  are 
called  to  preside  over  other  Churches.  You,  the  overseer,  or 
bishop,  of  the  Church  of  Rome,  took  upon  you  the  heavy 
responsibility  of  feeding  that  portion  of  the  flock  of  Christ, 
and  of  strengthening  your  brethren  with  good  example  and 
holy  doctrine.  Your  brethren,  who  look  to  you  for  counsel  and 
direction,  depend  in  a  certain  degree  on  you,  regarding  you  as 
an  elder  brother,  whose  judgment  and  prudence  may  aid  their 
timidity  and  weakness.  On  you,  therefore,  it  devolves  to  pro- 
pose to  them  that  which  is  of  God  and  of  the  Lord  Jesus 
Christ,  and  which  tends  to  the  welfare  of  His  Church.  You  it 
behoves  to  recall  to  their  primitive  purity  the  tmths  of  religion  ;  to 
take  away  out  of  it  every  admixture  of  that  which  is  extraneous, 
separating  thus  the  good  wheat  from  the  tares,  in  order  to  give 
to  the  Christian  people  the  nourishment  of  faith  and  of  salvation. 
Yoiu-  brethren  look  up  to  you  in  tliis  affair,  which  ought  to  be 


LinSR  TO  PIUS  IX.  169 

conducted  with  harmony,  in  order  to  preserve  the  union  of  the 
Chruttian  Churches ;  and  although  each  poflseises  over  his  own 
Church  an  equal  authority,  nevertheless  they  hesitate  to  act 
without  you,  and  they  expect  you  to  set  this  work  in  motion 
and  to  be  their  model  in  the  reformation  of  doctrines. 

Ye«,  Holy  Father,  the  reformation  of  doctrine  is  the  serious 
baJBeas  to  which  you  and  your  brethren  are  called  by  the 
people  to  turn  your  earnest  attention,  for  it  is  well  known  to  all 
Christians,  that  upon  the  purity  and  holiness  of  the  doctrines  of 
the  Church  depend  the  purity  and  hohness  of  the  actions 
of  believers.  Now,  neither  pure  nor  holy  are  the  doctrines 
which  proceed  from  man,  "  seeing  that  God  hath  shut  up  all 
men  in  disobedience,  that  is  in  sin,  in  order  that  he  might  have 
mercy  upon  all."  Therefore,  none  but  the  doctrines  of  God  are 
the  truth  in  religion;  all  else  are  lies. 

Think  you,  then,  that  those  are  doctrines  of  God,  which  are 
not  contained  in  His  Book,  and  which  are  opposed  to  the  sacred 
precepts  of  His  holy  Word  ?  Have  you  ever  compared  the 
doctrines  taught  in  primitive  times  with  those  of  later  ages? 
Have  you  ever  examined  together  the  dogmas  of  the  Decretals 
and  those  of  the  Bible  ?  I  have  compared  them,  and  I  have  shud- 
dered at  the  result  j  in  amazement  that  so  many  strange  novelties 
should  ever  have  been  introduced  into  Christianity,  amounting 
to  an  actual  renunciation  of  the  ancient  faith,  the  pure  creed  of 
our  fathers. 

Strip  yourself,  then,  of  that  fatal  prepossession  that  your 
predecessors  were  holy  and  infalhble.  Examine  carefully  the 
Bouroes  of  the  existing  belief.  Observe  what  is  from  God,  and 
what  proceeds  from  man.  Man  has  erred  in  presuming  to  legis- 
late in  the  things  of  God.  Not  only  singly  but  in  the  aggregate, 
men  have  erred.  The  Divine  assistance  was  no  doubt  promised, 
bat  it  was  for  {reserving  the  ancient  doctrines,  not  for  framing 
new  ones;  the  Holy  Spirit  is  with  those  who  beUeve  in  t^e 
ancient  Scriptures,  but  not  with  those  who  tamper  with  the  Divine 
Word.  In  the  middle  ages  the  ministers  of  the  Catholic  Church 
rereDed  in  innovation,  and  from  that  time  the  desire  for  change 
has  grown  upon  them  to  such  a  degree,  that  primitive  Christianity 
is  DO  longer  to  be  raoognised. 


170  APPENDIX, 

Think  you  tliat  it  was  ever  permitted  to  men  to  add  their 
ideas  and  their  thoughts  to  the  ideas  and  thoughts  of  God,  or 
to  take  anything  away  from  the  Divine  Book  ?  Are  you  not 
rather  persuaded  with  me  that  whosoever  does  this,  on  him  are 
denounced  the  chastisements  of  God,  as  it  is  written  in  the  last 
verse  of  the  Divine  Revelation — "  God  will  take  away  his  part 
in  the  book  of  hfe,  and  in  the  holy  city,  and  in  the  things  which 
are  written  in  this  book?"  To  add  to  the  meaning,  or  to  change 
it !  to  overturn  on  certain  points  the  entire  system  and  spirit  of 
the  Divine  Legislator!  I  ask  you,  who  were  an  elder  before 
me,  and  a  ruler  among  the  elders,  are  such  things  to  be  endured  ? 
However  ancient  may  be  these  errors,  however  concealed  by  some 
or  acquiesced  in  by  others,  shall  prescription  prevail  to  this 
extent?  No!  no  antiquity  can  prescribe  in  regard  to  the  abuses 
of  religion ;  and  even  if  the  whole  world  were  combined  to 
maintain  error  (supposing  such  a  thing  were  possible),  even  that 
would  not  hinder  its  destruction  by  any  single  person  who  had  with 
him  the  Word  of  Truth.  This,  then,  is  the  pouat  at  issue ; — the 
abuses  of  Rome  have  existed  long,  and  obtained  for  a  long  time 
the  support  of  the  multitude  ;  do  they  for  that  reason  cease  to  be 
abuses  ?  Her  errors  have  been  adopted,  applauded,  followed ;  do 
they  on  that  account  cease  to  be  errors  ?  And  must  not  abuses 
and  errors  be  reformed,  wheresoever  they  may  be  found,  or 
however  long  they  may  have  existed  ? 

But  with  whom  does  it  rest  to  effect  a  reform  in  matters  of 
religion  ?  Who  is  to  promote  it,  and  by  what  means  ?  I  reply, 
the  bishops,  fii-st ;  then  the  elders ;  afterwards  all  who  have  a  zeal 
for  religion.  The  instrument  of  reformation  is  most  simple,  viz., 
the  Word  of  God  as  it  stands  written  in  the  Holy  Scriptures,  pure 
as  our  forefathers  received  it,  powerful  in  itself  to  change  the  face 
of  the  whole  universe.  The  truths  of  that  sacred  Book  constitute 
the  whole  of  Christianity ;  out  of  it  there  exists  no  truth  for  the 
Church.  Be  it  yours,  then.  Holy  Father,  with  the  sacred  Bible 
in  your  hand,  to  reform  the  doctrine  corrupted  by  your  prede- 
cessors !  No  one  so  well  as  you  can  do  this  work ;  no  one  so 
much  as  you  is  bound  to  do  it  by  conscience  and  by  special 
obligation. 

Let  this  consideration  sink  deep  into  your  mind,  how  sad  is 


LBTTBR  TO  PIUS  IX.  171 

the  iiresent  state  of  religion  in  lUiiy,  that  country  with  which 
vou  are  moet  doeelj  connected.  Where  is  now  to  be  found 
among  lu  that  holiness  of  faith,  whence  alone  proceeds  hoUness 
of  worka?  When  we  look  for  Christianity,  what  do  we  see 
around  ua  ?  lufidehty  or  superstition.  Infidelity  in  all  thoee 
damea  who  call  themselves  enUghtened ;  superstition  in  thoee 
who  follow  the  teaching  of  your  priests.  On  the  one  hand,  men 
who  hare  cast  off  all  belief,  have  made  one  bundle  of  Christ- 
tianity  and  of  Popery.  Seeing  that  both  Gospel  and  Canons  came 
to  them  from  the  same  hands,  they  have  concluded  that  both 
most  be  lies ;  that  both  being  preached  to  them  with  the  same 
fervour,  nay,  the  Canons  sometimes  exalted  above  the  Gospel, 
th)&gt;  one  and  the  other  have  been  contrived  only  to  shackle 
consciences,  to  degrade  the  spirit  of  man,  to  subjugate  the  people 
to  the  nde  of  one  individual  who  has  had,  in  all  times,  an  appe- 
tite for  power !  Thus,  not  distinguishing  the  work  of  man  from 
that  which  is  of  God,  viz.,  pure  Christianity,  they  have  rejected 
ever}' thing  alike,  and  live  the  Ufe  of  inBdels.  On  the  other  hand, 
men  who  receive  impUcitly  all  that  is  taught  them — to  whom  all 
is  gold  which  is  sold  by  the  priests — to  whom  all  is  sacred  which 
has  any  show  of  religion  or  piety — who,  not  caring  for  faith, 
seek  only  for  good  works;  and,  thinking  Httle  or  nothing  about 
God  and  Jesus  Christ,  run  after  saints  and  the  Virgin, — relics, 
images,  and  indulgences ! 

Within  these  two  classes  is  comprised,  generally  speaking, 
all  the  Christianity  of  Italy  ;  and  to  this  unsoundness  is  to  be 
referred  the  reigning  unmorality,  the  want  of  energy  of  mind,  the 
absence  of  virtue  and  of  union  among  our  citizens.  "  The  Church 
which  divides  the  races  within  our  countr)'"  was  the  great  sub- 
ject of  lamentation  to  tliat  immortal  genius,  who,  three  centuries 
ago,  on  the  banks  of  the  Amo,  revealed  to  the  world  the  wicked- 
ness of  prinoes.  **  The  Church  which  demoralizes  the  people" 
u.th  its  doetrines  even  more  than  with  its  practices,  is  the 
lamentotioii  which  I,  a  sod  of  Italy,  a  minister  of  the  Italian 
peof^,  raiae  aloud  to  heaTen,  and  which,  with  all  the  strength 
that  is  in  me,  I  would  echo  in  the  ears  of  all  good  men 
who  lore  our  country.  Yes !  from  the  Church,  or  rather  from 
Iboia  who  call  themsdrw  the  Church,  proceeds  all  that  series  of 


172  APPENDIX. 

evils  which  degrades  our  beautiful  land  and  lowers  our  people  in 
the  eyes  of  the  strang-er.  Nor  will  I  ever  cease  to  utter  my 
voice,  until,  in  this  respect  more  than  any  other,  our  beloved  Italy 
shall  be  seen  reforming  herself,  and  by  this  means  returning' 
gloriously  to  holiness  of  faith,  to  purity  of  morals,  to  mutual 
love  among  our  citizens. 

And  you,  Holy  Father !  are  you  not,  like  me,  an  Italian  ? 
do  not  you,  like  me,  feel  burning  within  you  the  sacred  love  of 
country — "  la  dolce  caritct  del  natio  loco  ?"  Oh !  I  will  not  so 
wrong  you  as  to  suppose  you  now  destitute  of  a  sentiment  which 
has  hitherto  distinguished  you ;  a  sentiment  which  ought  rather 
to  grow  stronger  in  your  mind,  now  that,  as  bishop  of  the  most 
ancient  of  cities,  you  occupy  the  most  glorious  of  thrones.  To 
you  the  applauding  people  ascribe  a  generous  liberality ;  from 
you  are  expected  good  laws,  and  ameliorations  in  the  difficult 
details  of  government.  From  you  they  hope  to  receive  that,  in 
receiving  which  they  would  receive  everything ;  that  which  by 
one  act  you  have  the  power  to  give  them — a  religious  reforma- 
tion. Whoever  thinks  correctly,  knows,  that  on  this  point  depend 
social  improvement,  public  prosperity,  and  in  a  word  every 
good  thing  which,  by  the  favour  of  Divine  Providence,  citizens 
are  capable  of  acquiring.  Without  this,  we  shall  always  return 
to  wretchedness,  unhappiness,  disunion.  Without  this,  there 
will  never  be  contentment,  never  tranquillity  among  the  people. 
The  spirit  of  restless  change  will  continue  to  agitate  them — to 
their  own  injury,  it  is  true,  but  also  to  the  destruction  of  you 
and  of  others  who  are  their  princes. 

Reform,  then,  let  us  have  in  the  Church ;  but  what  reform, 
and  in  what  particulars  ?  Must  I  repeat  it?  Remove  every- 
thing that  was  invented  by  Popes,  decreed  by  Popes,  designed  for 
the  interest  of  Popes.  All  this  is  Popery,  not  Christianity ;  and 
we  are  resolved  to  be  henceforth  Christians,  not  Piipists.  The 
reformation  is  complete,  when  once  the  sentence  is  uttered,  "  The 
Bible,  and  nothing  but  the  Bible." 

For  instance,  that  you,  Pius,  should  be  Bishop  of  Rome,  is 
not  contrary  to  the  Bible.  But  this  is  contrary  to  if,  that  you 
should  assume  a  bishopric  over  those  sees  which  huvo  already 
another  bishoi);  for  all  bi.shops  are  equal,  each  one  the  pii.-tor  c! 


LvrriR  TO  PIU8  IX.  173 

hifl  own  flock,  and  each  independent  of  the  other.  For  my  part, 
you  )«)iouId  have  my  vote  to  be  bishop  of  all  Italy  were  all  the 
other  bishops  removed  j  but  you  cannot  rightfully  co- exist.  That 
dders,  too,  should  exist,  is  in  accordance  with  the  Bible — and 
you  may  call  them  priests,  if  you  will ;  but  as  for  friars,  they 
are  contrary  to  the  Bible;  their  vows  are  repugnant  to  the 
Gospel,  whatever  your  theologians  may  say  of  them ;  and  their 
ministry  useless,  at  least,  if  not  hurtful,  to  the  Church. 

What,  again,  do  we  mean  by  the  Church  ?  You  know  well 
that  the  Word  of  God  means  the  Christian  people.  It  is  contrary 
then  to  the  Bible  for  the  Church  to  mean  the  priests  only.  Let 
it  please  you,  Holy  Father,  to  consider  well,  for  a  moment,  this 
point,  which  is  at  present  of  the  highest  importance.  Do  you 
beheve  that  what  has  been  usurped  should  be  restored  ?  Let 
it,  then,  be  by  your  means  that  the  people  resume  their  ancient 
rights,  and  repossess  the  Church  according  to  their  right.  But 
what  Church  will  you  restore  to  the  people  of  Italy  ?  The 
Latin?  But  where  is  now  the  Latin  people,  or  the  Latin 
language?  Do  you  not  perceive  what  a  scourge  God  sent 
you  when  the  priests  of  Rome  wished  to  appropriate  the 
Church  to  themselves  and  to  make  it  their  private  pro- 
perty, declaring  themselves  princes  and  governors,  and  the 
people  subjects  and  slaves  to  the  Church  of  the  priests?  It 
was  a  cha.&lt;!tisement  not  unlike  that  which  God  sent  in  the 
valley  of  Shinar,  when  daring  men  set  themselves  to  build  the 
fiunoas  tower  which  was  to  reach  to  heaven.  Audacious 
priests,  in  the  thirteenth  century,  succeeded  similarly  in  raising 
themselves  into  a  spiritiml  power,  intending  to  hold  the  people 
for  ever  in  subjection.  But  God  sent  among  them  by  degrees 
the  spirit  of  confusion,  rendering  their  language  unintelligible  to 
the  people,  so  that  people  and  priests  were  compelled  to  separate. 
With  the  priests  remained  the  ancient  language,  that  with  which 
they  had  dictated  laws  at  variance  with  the  Gospel,  and,  some- 
tioias  in  Christ's  name,  sometimes  in  the  name  of  Moses,  had 
opprsssed,  bum^,  tortured  the  people;  a  language  associated 
with  enmes  which  daily  mounted  up  to  the  throne  of  the 
OmnipoCait,  protddng  the  infliction  of  condign  punishment, 

iiich  crimes  as  prayers  addressed  in  the  temple  to  saints 


174  APPENDIX. 

instead  of  to  God;  the  Word  of  Truth  exchanged  for  fables;  and 
Christian  teaching  founded  no  longer  on  the  ancient  doctrine 
of  the  Bible,  but  on  the  new  doctrine  of  the  Canons.  The 
whole  language  of  Catholicism,  having  become  exclusively 
Roman,  had  adulterated  the  things  of  God,  the  dogmas  and 
maxims  of  the  rehgion  of  Jesus  Christ. 

So  grievous  a  scandal  drew  down  upon  Rome  the  anger  of 
the  Eternal,  who  seemed,  as  it  were,  to  repeat  the  ancient 
words,  "  Come,  let  us  go  down  and  confound  their  language." 
That  beautiful  idiom,  which  originating  in  Latium  among  the 
descendants  of  Romulus  grew  with  the  greatness  of  ancient 
Rome,  the  language  of  Virgil  and  Tully,  became  confused  and 
hfeless;  and  Rome,  the  new  Babel,  beheld  issuing  from  her 
bosom  and  growing  up  at  once,  a  generation  of  sons  who  under- 
stood not  the  language  of  their  fathers.  The  Church  of  the 
priests  felt  the  heavy  blow  which  came  upon  it  from  heaven  ; 
but,  instead  of  weeping  and  humbling  herself  before  God — instead 
of  repenting  and  correcting  her  faults,  she  persisted  in  her  error, 
and  launched  her  anathemas  against  the  people ;  declaring,  like 
the  haughty  synagogue  of  old,  that  it  was  enough  for  her  to 
comprehend  herself, — as  for  the  people,  so  much  the  worse  for 
them,  if  thev  did  not  understand  her  lan^uag-e  ! 

What  followed  ?  People  and  priests  became  divided.  The 
Church  and  the  nation  became  separate  for  ever.  Church  and 
priests  calling  themselves  Latin,  while  the  nation  and  the 
people  called  themselves  Italians.  This  is  a  great  fact  which 
has  not  hitherto  been  enough  regarded.  The  people,  ever 
under  subjection  to  the  tyranny  of  the  priesthood,  had  not 
the  spirit  to  resist  oppression,  and  hardly  even  to  open  its 
eyes  to  look  upon  its  chains.  In  the  meantime  the  priests 
laboured  to  impress  them  with  a  belief  that  such  was  their 
natural  condition.  Slaves  by  the  will  of  the  strong,  they  were 
taught  to  believe  themselves  so  by  fatality  of  nature  and  by 
the  will  of  God.  Such  was  the  consequence  which  naturally 
resulted. 

But  enough  !  The  people  have  opened  their  eyes.  They 
have  beheld  their  chains.  Like  a  lion  they  have  bui-st  through 
them.    They  threaten  their  former  oppressors  with  a  look  that 


LBTTRR  TO  PIU8  IX.  175 

may  well  make  them  tremble.  Their  roaring  was  like  the  \TakiQg 
up  of  mtture,  indicating  a  grand  change  in  the  face  of  the  world. 
The  people  have  declared  that  the  times  are  gone  by  when  they 
would  submit  to  be  badly  {j^vemetl  by  tlieir  pretended  masters  j 
and  that  they,  the  people,  are  arbiters  in  their  own  affairs.  Now, 
we  priests  are  specially  bound  to  do  justice  to  the  people ;  for  to 
us,  more  than  to  others,  has  been  confided  tlieir  cause.  Be  it 
ours,  then,  to  enlighten  them,  which  is  the  first  thing  they  need. 
Be  it  ours  to  assist  and  protect  them  with  that  holy  iegis 
which  themselves  have  confided  to  us.  Let  us  imite  with  them 
in  the  true  religion  of  our  forefathers.  When  God  extinguished 
our  Latin  language,  he  meant  thereby  to  punish  us  the  priests, 
and  not  the  people.  Let  us  submit  to  that  punishment.  The 
Latin  language  has  corrupted  the  truths  of  the  catholic  Church, 
and,  therefore,  God  hiis  extinguished  it.  Let  our  Church  arise 
again  in  the  Itahan  language,  and  let  this  be  the  ancient  Church 
of  apostolic  times.  Exile,  Anathema,  to  the  Church  of  the 
middle  ages  !  Thus,  alone,  can  we  priests  become  again  united 
to  the  people;  thus,  alone,  can  we  recover  the  Church.  For— once 
more  let  it  be  said — the  Church  means  the  people ;  bishops  and 
priests  being  only  ministers  of  the  people.  It  is  not  in  the 
natiu%  of  things  that  the  language  of  the  people  should  be  other 
than  the  language  of  the  Church.  Italian  is  our  language,  and 
Italian  most  necessarily  be  our  Church. 

This  Church  it  u  which  I  desire  to  serve  as  a  minister. 
Will  you  not,  Holy  Father,  serve  it  as  bishop  ?  Gladly  would 
I  then  return  to  you ;  and  along  with  me  gladly  would  return 
many  who  are  now  alienated  from  it  Thenceforth  they  will 
have  no  cause  to  separate  from  it,  for  Jesus  Christ  will  truly 
reig^  in  our  Church,  and  together  with  Jesus  Christ  there  will 
reign  onion,  peace,  concord,  charity.  Oh,  what  a  sight  were 
this !  "  How  good  and  how  pleasant  it  is  for  brethren  to  dwell 
together  in  unity!"  Thus  united  in  the  Italian  Church,  we 
aboald  remove  everything  which  separates  us  from  other  Christian 
Charehes.  Germany,  England,  Switzerland — all  other  countries 
which  are  at  present  divided  from  the  communion  of  Rome, 
would  be  again  united  with  us  in  one  faith.  Nations  would  be 
drawn  together  in  the  bonds  of  brotherhood.     And  you.  Holy 


176  APPENDIX. 

Father,  would  be  the  blessed  instrument  by  which  woidd  be 
realised  the  Divine  prophecy,  "  There  shall  be  one  fold  and  one 
shepherd." 

"  The  grace  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  the  love  of  God, 
and  the  fellowship  of  the  Holy  Ghost,  be  with  us  all.    Amen." 

Malta,  1846.
