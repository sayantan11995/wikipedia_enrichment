CHAPTER XXIIThe Captive QueenJOANNA was celebrated for her oratory ; wehave seen her pleading her own cause beforePope Clement VI. and his Cardinals in the Con-sistory-court at Avignon with consummate skill, andon other occasions we have heard her haranguingher councillors, but never perhaps was she moreeloquent than now, when the Count of Caserta andthe Provencal barons were admitted to her presence.Neither Charles nor any of his followers were presentonly Joanna and her court were in the room whenthe French deputies were introduced.Traces of the terrible privations and anxiety shehad gone through were visible on the Queen's beauti-ful face, on which both mental and physical sufferinghad left their marks ; but her customary majesticgrace and dignity had not deserted her, and withthem she greeted the Provencal subjects who hadcome too late to save her throne.If they expected315316The Beautiful Queenreproach for their fatal delay they were not dis-appointed, for they were received with it." Why, my friends, why have you so long delayedI have suffered what no womanto succour me ?and hardly any man can bear.

He took great delight in all these, but heparted with many of his treasures to raise moneyfor his expedition to Naples to secure his Sicilianthrone.Charles's wrath at finding Joanna had outwittedhim, and defeated the object he had had in viewwhen he granted her an interview with the Frenchdeputies, was very great ; and when he saw themasts of the French galleys disappear below thehorizon, as they were hastening to help his rival,he was furious, and determined to try the effect ofWith this endharsh treatment upon his victim.in view, he first of all had the Queen removed tothe Castel del Ovo under a strong guard, as aprisoner, but he allowed some of her ladies-in-waiting to go with her.Her niece Agnes, widow of the Prince of Verona,who with hersister, Joanna, Duchess ofDurazzo, were taken prisoners with the Queen,elderThe Captive Queen319was now married to the son of the Duke of Andriaby Charles, who, to promote his own interests,bestowed her upon one of the Queen's greatestenemies like a captive slave, without consultingher.Later on, when Charles had offended Urban,and it was rumoured that the Pope thought ofdeposing him in favour of this son of the Dukeof Andria, who by this marriage had a doubleclaimtothesuccessionto the throne, Charlescaused Agnes and her two innocent children, andJoanna of Durazzo, to be thrown into a dungeon,where they all died of starvation and misery, somesay of poison.The Queen had surrendered at the end of August,and on November nth, St. Martin's day, Charlesand his wife Margaret were solemnly crowned inallegianceto Urban as the true Pope.the Cathedral of Naples, after taking the oaths ofWhenCharles was led in procession round the city afterhis coronation, under a canopy of state, the Dukeof Andria, who had not yet deserted him, held hisbridle on one side, and the Count of ConversanoBefore six months had passed, bothon the other.these noblemen had gone back to Joanna's cause.Great efforts were made to restore cheerfulnessto Naples after the coronation by means of banquetsand pageants, and all the shows in which theNeapolitans were known to delight ; but so many320The Beautiful Queenfamilies were in mourning for their relatives whohad perished in the war, and so many houses wereempty, as their owners had fled the city, that all therejoicings did little to dispel the general gloom.Very soon Charles found that it was very difficultfor a usurper to satisfy the claims of his partisans,and impossible to content the ambition of his sup-porters, and the fickle Neapolitans soon began toreturn to their old allegiance.The Counts of Ariano, Fondi, and Aversa hadremained in arms for Joanna, and they were nowjoined by that rebel, the Duke of Andria, the San-severini family, and the Counts of Conversano,The Sanseverini and theLece, and Montenovo.Duke of Andria were deadly foes, neverthelessthey now acted in concert, Charles having estrangedAndria because he was unable to give back all hisformer possessions of which Joanna had deprivedhim, and the Sanseverini were jealous and disgustedwith Charles for giving Agnes of Verona as wifeto the son of the Duke of Andria.But where, it may well be asked, was Louis ofAnjou all this time ?For his delay in coming toJoanna's aid was partly the cause of thefinaltragedy.That delay was in the first instance un-avoidable, as his post of Regent, to which he wasappointed on the death of Charles V., renderedhis presence in Paris as necessary as it was un-doubtedly agreeable to him.In June, 1 3 8 1, Louis,The Captive Queen321who seems to have been enjoyinghimself verymuch at the time in his new position, received,through the Count of Caserta, Joanna's desperateappeal for help in her extremity, and, having calleda Council together, he decided to leave France im-mediately for Naples and claiminheritance.Then came the news of Charles's successes, andLouis realised that he had a kingdom to reconquer,hisas well as a frontier to defend, before he couldUndertake possession of his Sicilian inheritance.these difficulties his zeal to go to help Joanna seemsto have cooled considerably, and after vacillating agreat deal, as fresh news from Naples reached him,France decided to abandon Joanna to her fate.This was in October, and after a while Louis,tired of doing nothing, and regretting that he hadlet his Sicilian crown slip through his fingers, enteredinto correspondence with the Neapolitan ambassador,and went to Avignon to consult with the antipope,Clement VII., and to try to get the Provencals toacknowledge him as their prince, and help him towin the Sicilian throne.He stayed four months in Avignon, and receivedthe encouragement of Clement to proceed to Italy,and on March 1st Clement invested him with thetitle of Duke of Calabria, reserved for the heir-presumptive to the throne of Naples.He spent another three months collecting troopsin Provence, and having been joined by the Duke21322The Beautiful Queenof Savoy, at last, after all these maddening delays,he set sail for Naples at the head of a large army,amid the shouts of the Provencals of " Vive PapeClement VII., Vive Madame la Reine Jeanne I.,"Vive le due de Calabrie !While he is leaving Marseilles with his splendidtroops we must return to Naples to see what wasgoing on there, and in so doing we must not forgetthat the Neapolitan revolution was a double re-volutionâ€”it was religious as well as political.Inacknowledging the usurper Charles III., so wronglynamed "of Peace," the Neapolitans acknowledgedthe authority of the true Pope, Urban VI., and indeposing and deserting Joanna they condemnedClement VII. as antipope, and threw off their allegi-ance to both their temporal and spiritual sovereign,though the latter was a usurper.There had entered into Naples with Charles, thePapallegate,Gentile de Sangro, who,iftheUrbanists in Naples had suffered under Joanna,now immediately began torule the Clementineclergy with a rod of iron.In one day, accordingto Urban's secretary, de Niem, he dismissed nofewer than thirty-two Clementine abbots, bishops,and archbishops ; and not content with deprivingthem of their benefices, he cast them into prison,and those who refused to acknowledge Urban weresent to the scaffold. Among these last was theArchbishop of Salerno.The Captive Queen323A remarkable scene took place in the ChurchThe two Clementineof St.cardinals who were taken prisoners with Joannawere led into this church among a vast crowd ofNaples.Clareinpeople, and one of them, Cardinal de GifFone, in-timidated by the presence of Charles of Durazzoand the Legate, di Sangro, denied the antipope,Clement, and burnt his hat, while the robes andhat of his companion, Cardinal d'ltro, were con-sumed inthesame flames.After being thuspublicly degraded, together with some other Clemen-tine prelates, they were castintoprison, whereCardinal d'ltro died.To strengthen his position in Naples, Urban nowcreated a large number of Neapolitan cardinals,some of whom, later on, when Durazzo had in-curred Urban's displeasureâ€”their patience with thePope's conduct being exhaustedâ€”conspired againstUrban, with the idea of putting him under restraintas mad, or of delivering him into Durazzo's hands.In reprisal for this, Urban on discovering it putsix of them into irons in the cells at Nocera, andthen subjected them to torture.Gentile de Sangro, who had himself tortured theClementine clergy, was one of these six victimsof Urban's cruelty, and, being an enormously stoutman, fainted when the executioners lifted him fromthe ground with cords on to the rack, on whichhe was thrice stretched.3 2 4The Beautiful QueenThe old Cardinal of Venice each time that he wastortured exclaimed, " Christ suffered for us."Thesame authority, de Niem, says that the man chosento apply these tortures was a Genoese pirate wellknown for his hatred of clerics.Historians differ as to the date on which Durazzocaused Joanna to be removed from Castel del Ovo,for fear that her presence in Naples should causea rebellion in her favour ; but it seems most probablethat it took place about March 28, 1382, and not,as Giannone says, a few days after her surrender,when, as we have said, she was taken to the Casteldel Ovo.The Castle of Muro 1 was a great, gloomy fortress,situated in Durazzo's own territory, inherited fromhis father, in the province of the Basilicata, to thesouth-east of Naples, and on this account it was fromhis point of view a much safer place of detentionfor the captive Queen.It stood in a wild, barren,mountainous district in an isolated situation, noteasy of access, and as Joanna approached its gloomytowers her heart must have sunk within her.She had been treated fairly well on the whole atCastel del Ovo, during her six or seven months'imprisonment there ; but now her guard was mademuch more strict, and composed in part of theHungarian soldiers, who hated her. Her nieces had1 The author of " Rulers of the South " says he knows no castlewhich gives so good an idea of baronial life in the fourteenthcentury as this fortress of Muro.The Captive Queen325been separated from her in Naples, but now shewas deprived of her ladies-in-waiting also ; and sheespecially felt the loss of Clemence di Collennucci,a young and pretty daughter of one of the Neapolitanbarons, to whom she was much attached, and whoBefore Joanna waswas one of her maids-of-honour.taken away from Castel del Ovo, Clemence was torn,weeping bitterly, from the unhappy Queen, and noentreaties would induce Charles to permit her toaccompany her beloved mistress to her new prison.Itis said, however, that love found out a wayto circumvent Charles ; and a few days after Joannahad been removed from Naples, Clemence, withcropped hair, disguised as a Carthusian novice, andFrancis de Baux, Duke of Andria, who had nowreturned to his allegiance to Joannaâ€”clad in thehabit of a professed monk of the same Orderâ€”setforth on foot to make a pilgrimage to Muro, andendeavour to obtain admission in this guise to thepresence of the Queen, on pretence of offeringher spiritual consolation.This romantic tale does not seem to be wellauthenticated, and we doubt if it ever really hap-pened ; but as the Italians say, " Si non e vero eben trovato "; and we can but hope that Joanna'slast days were soothed by thefavourite attendant, whose high spirit and devotionto her royal mistress may have given her courage torun the grave risk she did if she made this attempt.presenceof her;326The Beautiful QueenIt is possible, even probable, that the Duke ofAndria may have earnestly desired an interviewwith Joanna unknown to Durazzo, to endeavourto persuade her to nominate his son (now marriedto her niece Agnes of Verona), as her heir, and it isquite likely he might have taken this step to attainit. He may, too, have felt remorse for his formerrebellion against Joanna, which had been instru-mental in bringing her to her present sad conditionhe may have desired to ask her forgiveness, andconsult with her as to some way of attempting herrescue ; and the only way to accomplish this wasto assume some disguiseâ€”and in those days that ofa monk was the safest, and the most likely to obtainadmission to the royal prisoner.In this gloomy castle Joanna was kept in closeimprisonment for two months, and deniedthehonours due to her high rank, before the finaltragedy took place.At the same time that she was removed fromNaples, Charles caused her husband, Prince Othoof Brunswick, his prisoner-of-war, to be taken tothe Castle of Altamura, on the extreme west of theBasilicata.Joanna asked one favour of her con-queror on reaching Castel del Muro, and that wasnot for herself, but the release of her husband, Othoof Brunswick ; and this request Durazzo ultimatelygranted after Joanna's death, the account of whichwe must reserve for another chapter.
