CHAPTER XXJoanna is ExcommunicatedLOUIS of Anjou, whom Joanna had decidedto adopt as her heir in the place of Charlesof Durazzo, was the eldest brother of Charles V.,King of France, and, after the King, the mostpowerful person in that kingdom ; so it seemedto be an advantageous move on the Queen's part,particularly as the University of Paris had recentlydeclared in favour of the antipope, Clement VII.Joanna hoped, by making the King's brother herheir, to enlist the services of France to defend hercrown against the Pope and Charles of Durazzo.Charles had been for some time engaged in fightingfor the King of Hungary, Joanna's old enemy, inthe wars between the Venetians and the Genoesefor maritime supremacy ; and Urban now thoughtthe time had come for him to send for his wifeand children, who were living with Joanna, so hecommanded him to do so prior to advancing withhis Hungarian troops into Naples.292Joanna is Excommunicated293Charles obeyed the Pope, and wrote to the Queenasking that his wife and children should be sentto him ;and Joanna, who must have feltthisstroke acutely, with her usual generosity grantedhis request, although it was clearly against her owninterest to do so, and sent her adopted daughterMargaret, with her little son Ladislaus, afterwardsKing of Naples, and his sister with a safe escortTheto Friuli, where Charles was then quartered.Queen was destined never again to see Margaret ofDurazzo, whom she had loved and cherished asher own daughter—aforesaw when with a heavy heart she parted fromcontingencyprobablysheher.Meanwhile Urban's unpopularity was so greatin Rome that the mob had attacked the Vaticanwith sticks and stones ; but, nothing daunted, thePope, who with all his faults knew no fear, vestedfull pontificals and boldly showedhimself inhishimself to the people, trusting that the sight othim, whom they regarded as the Vicar of Christ,would strike terror into their hearts and terrifythem into submission—as it did, and the tumultsubsided.This was in January, 1380, and in the followingApril St. Catherine of Sienadied, and by herdeath the Pope losthis earthly guardian angel,who alone of all his subjects knew how to controlhis violent temper, and who had always urged him294The Beautiful Queento be patient and merciful with Joanna and hisotherenemies,athad encouraged him to defend his throne againstthesamewhiletimeshethem.Joanna's conduct in taking so prominent a partin the election and recognition of Robert of Genevaas the antipope had naturally incensed Urban moreand more with her, and a week after St. Catherine'sdeath he issued a Bull of Excommunication againsther.In it he denounced " Joanna, formerly Queen ofthe Two Sicilies for her iniquities, wickedness, andenormous excesses, committed against Us and theRoman Church, and We declare her to be a schis-matical, heretical, and blasphemous conspirator againstUs and guilty of the crime of ' lese-majeste,' and Wedeprive her of and depose her from all her dignities,honours, kingdoms, and lands, which We confiscateall and each, and We absolve from their fidelity andobedience to her all who have sworn allegiance toher, and none shall be held bound to obey her orto pay any debts due to her. And We inhibitunderindividualexcommunication allpainofprinces,dukes,barons, and nobles,and underpain of an interdict all communities and Univer-sities, from obedience to her.Rome, April29th,intheGiven at St. Peter's,year of Ourthirdpontificate."At the same time Urban fulminated a sentence—Joanna is Excommunicated295of depositionagainst BernardofRhodes,theClementine usurper of the Archbishopric of Naples,and confirmed the Abbot Barruto in the officeinhis place, and he excommunicated Onerato Cajetanoand Rinaldo Orsini, Count of Nola, and his brotherGiovanni.The Pope now proceeded to preach a crusadeagainst Joanna ; but as this produced but little moneyand he was at this time nearly bankrupt, he seizedthe gold and silver images in the churches of Rome,and the jewels which adorned the shrines, and agreat deal of the altar plate as well, and sold themor had them melted down.About this time Charles Durazzo entered Italyat the head of 8,000 Hungarian soldiers, besidesa large body of German and Italian infantry, whopillaged and destroyed the defenceless towns andvillages they passed through, and would have be-sieged Florence if Sir John Hawkwood and hiscompanies had not intervened and made a com-promise by which theEnglish knight and hisfollowers entered Durazzo's service, and the Flor-entines agreed to lend Durazzo 40,000 florinswhich he had never the smallest intention of re-funding—and promised not to assist Joanna.In the month of May Charles arrived in Rome,and was afFectionately received by the Pope, butforced to agree to the conditions upon which Urbanoffered him the crown of Naples, which as we know296The Beautiful Queenwere that the greater part of the kingdom shouldUrbanbelong to his nephew, Butillo Prignano.then proceeded formally to invest Durazzo with theTwo Sicilies on the above conditions, to whichCharles agreed, inwardly resolving that he wouldIn return Urban bestowed uponnever fulfil them.him all the treasure he had realised by the spoliationof the Roman churches, and, fortified with thesesinews of war, Charles now advanced on Naples.While Charles is thus spreading terror throughoutItaly, by the excesses of his barbarian Hungariansand lawless freebooters, let us turn and see whatthe unhappy, excommunicated Queen andstepsher husband were taking to defend her throne andlife.In a document dated July 29th, 1380, signedat Castel del Ovo, Joanna declared that she deprivedCharles Durazzo of all pretensions to the inheritanceof her kingdom, and that in his place she had adoptedLouis, Duke of Anjou and Turenne, Count ofMans, and Lord of Montpellier, brother to CharlesV., King of France, as heir to all her dominions inNaples, Provence, and Piedmont for himself andall his descendants.This action displeased many of her Neapolitansubjects, who had known Charles from his cradle,and were proud of his military exploits, and in spiteof his faults were attached to him, whereas Louis ofFrom this timeAnjou was a stranger to them.Joanna is Excommunicated297Joanna's kingdom was torn with dissensions, politicalas well as religious—between not only the twoparties of the Urbanists and Clementines, but theadherents of Charles of Durazzo and their opponents,the followers of Joanna and Louis of Anjou, also.Among those who now deserted Joanna werethe two Orsini, the Counts of Nola.In the midstof all this trouble, confusion was rendered " worseconfounded" by a tumult in the piazzas of the city,between the nobles. Those of Capuana and Nidopretended that they had the right conceded to themby the late King Robert to precede all the otherbarons ; whereas the barons of Portanova, Porto,and S. Arcangelo maintained, on the contrary, thatthey had the precedence of the most ancient nobles.This controversy led to battles in the streets andto much bloodshed, and on August 7th the wholecity was in a state of alarm ; but Prince Otho, at therisk of his own life, accompanied by some otherbarons, joined in the fray, and succeeded in quellingthe disturbance.Joanna pardoned the principal offenders, who hadprecede each otherby their foolish ambition toplaced the throne in danger ; but the Queen wasever clement and merciful to a fault.Unfortunately for Joanna, the death of the FrenchKing, Charles V., took place on September 16thin the same year, and this delayed the advent ofLouis of Anjou, who was declared Regent of France,298The Beautiful Queenand was obliged to remain in Paris for some time ;so he was unable to come at once to her aid, althoughit was now in his own interest to do so.The antipope Clement confirmed Joanna's adop-tion of Louis, and had the insolence to bestow uponhim the Papal States, which were in the possessionof the true Pope, Urban VI.As time drew on Charles approached nearer toNaples, and his forces were daily increased bydeserters from Joanna's party, many of whom wereterrified by the sentence of excommunication pro-nounced against her by Urban, and, fearing for theirspiritual welfare, declared for him and Charles ofDurazzo.Nothing daunted by her falling fortunes and theperils which threatened her throne and life, Joannatook her courage in both hands, like the bravewoman she was, and determined to make a boldShe placed great confidence in thefight for it.valour of her husband Otho, although his adherentswere few compared to those of Charles, and shetrusted also in the false promises of her Neapolitanbarons, many of whom ultimately deserted her.her greatest hope was in her Provencal fleet, whichshe had summoned to her aid ; but this took a longtime in days when there were no telegraph-wiresButto communicate her wishes to them, and only thewind and their oars to bring them when summoned.When matters becamemoredesperate,andp. 298]URBAN THE SIXTH.Joanna is Excommunicated299to her appeal.Durazzo was fast approaching Naples, she sentthe Count of Caserta to France, to entreat hernew heir, Louis of Anjou, to hasten to her aidas quickly as possible, and he did his best to respondHe set about collecting a largearmy; but the long distance from Naples and thedifficulty of findingto feed his men,when there was no such thing as a commissariat,delayed his arrival and gave rise to the Neapolitanproverb, " The lilies of France will not take root aprovisionsecond time in Italy."The key to the kingdom of Naples was SanGermano, and here Otho, who was consideredone of the first captains of his day, prepared toBut many of thedisputeNeapolitan barons who had promised to join himCharles'sadvance.there failed to keep their promises, and he wasobliged to retire and leave the mountain passesopen and fall back on Naples, where a body ofmercenaries in Joanna's pay reinforced him.Durazzo followed him so quickly that on July 1 7th,1 38 1, the two armies encamped at five in the even-ing under the walls of the city, so close togetherthat the knights in the rival forces could recogniseeach other.Charles had with him the traitor, the Duke ofAndria, the Papal legate, Gentilis de Sangro, andUrban's nephew Francis or Butillo Prignano, nowendowed with the empty tide of Prince of Capua,3°°The Beautiful Queenfor the title was all he ever enjoyed from thatDurazzo had also with him many ofthe prominent Neapolitan barons, a whole bandprincipality.of adventurers and malefactors, and some of theprincipal municipal officers of Naples.Otho hadfewer barons in his army, as Joanna had kept mostof those whom she believed to be faithful to hercause in the city to quell disturbances there if anyshould arise.For three hours the two armies remained in sightof each other without attempting to fight.Charleswas afraid to give battle to Otho, though his armywas much the greater, lest the Neapolitans shouldfall on his rear while the Prince of Brunswick wasengaging him in front.Otho had succeeded ingetting Charles between him and the city ; but thismanoeuvre was afterwards frustrated by the treacheryof some citizens belonging to Urban's party, whomanaged to climb over the walls and told Durazzothe citizens were divided into two parties—one forUrban and him, and the other for Joanna andClement ; and they offered to conduct a few of hisfollowers across the sands to the Porta del Conceria,an unguarded gate which was supposed to besufficiently protected by the sea.Durazzo selected a few of his soldiers who couldswim, and sent them to this gate, which they reachedby swimming—some accounts say by wading throughthe waves—and, findingit unlocked as well asJoanna is Excommunicated301unguarded, they passed through and made straightHere they raised the cry" and werefor the market-place.of " Viva il Re Carlo e il Papa Urbano !immediately joined by some of Charles's old friendswho were also Urbanists, and together they madetheir way, fighting, to the Porta del Mercato, beforewhich Durazzo was encamped, and, before Joanna'sadherentscould defendit, they opened it, andCharles and a large body of his troops enteredthe city.No sooner were the Hungarian soldiers underCharles inside Naples than they strongly fortifiedthe gate by which they had entered, and marchedto the Porta Capuana and placed another guardthere, and then proceeded to Porta Reale, whichwas opposite to Otho's army, and guarded it againsttheir entrance.Otho soon saw what was going on, and immediatelyattempted to cut up the rearguard of the enemy ;
