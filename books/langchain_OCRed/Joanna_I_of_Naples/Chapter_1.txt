CHAPTER IIntroductory" For she was beautiful ; her beauty madeThe bright world dim, and everything besideSeemed like the fleeting image of a shade."Shelley.THE subject of this biography was, accordingto all accounts, one of the loveliest womenof all time, but there is much difference of opinionamong historians about her character.Some ofsaint and aher biographersregard herasamartyr, a victim to calumny ;others have castthe vilest reproaches against her, even suggestingthat she was, as her detractorsmaintained, oneof theconspiratorsin theassassination of herfirst husband ;but all are agreed that she wassupremely beautiful and exceedingly talented.Joanna I. of Naples, whose romantic story re-sembles in many respects that of Mary Queen ofScots, with whom she is often compared, is said2The Beautiful Queento have been the most beautiful Queen that everThe theme of poets, whose friend andlived.liberal patroness she was, all Europe rang with herpraise in the middle of the fourteenthcentury,when she was known in all the foreign courts ofEurope as "la douce Reine." Her own courtwas magnificent and highly civilised and refined ;it attracted the principal men of genius of the age,poets, of whom Petrarch was the first, and writers,with Boccaccio as chief, frequented it.If it be true that the women and the countriesthat have no history only are happy, we may rightlyinfer that intensely unhappy must have been the" sweet Queen " whose storyrelatedin theisfollowing pages, and the kingdom over which sheruled, for their history during the whole of herreign, from 1343 to 1382, was most exciting andoften dramatic in its interest.The scene is constantly changing from the luxuryof the most brilliant court in Europe to the hard-ships of the battle-field, from the gay songs of thetroubadour to the war-cry of the barbarian invader,from palace to prison, from the ballroom to thetorture-chamber, from the love-stories of brave menand lovely women to the devastating ravages ofthe Plague, from that " fragment of Heaven vouch-safed to earth, Naples,"fiends thatthetoin-habited it.The mysteries of history are more enthrallingIntroductory;3than the mysteries of fiction, which only remainmysteries to the end of the volume, while mostof the former remain unsolved to the end of time.The central event of the reign of Joanna, themurder of Andrew of Hungary, is one of theunguessed mysteries of history : we look " downthe long arches of the years," and we see historiansattempting to solve it, some accusing Joanna—whowas certainly innocent of consenting to it ; othersfixing the guilt upon Louis of Taranto, Joanna'ssecond husband ; others on Charles of Durazzoothers again on Philippa the Catanese, and her grand-daughter Sancha ; and yet others on the Countessof Durazzo,— all of whom are dramatis fersona inthe drama we are about to describe ; but the actualmurderers will never be known—probably they weresome hired assassins. One thing is certain : therewas a plot to assassinate Andrew the Hungarian,and it succeeded ; but who all the chief conspiratorswere can never be certainly affirmed, though we maybe able to fix upon them with a high degree ofprobability.Just as difficult is it to get a true picture of aQueen whose biographers vary so much in theirestimation of her character, and this from reasonsnational, political, and religious. The fact that inher later years Joanna was unfortunately the partisanof the anti-pope Clement VII. prejudiced somewriters so deeply against her that their judgment4The Beautiful Queenof her character was completely warped.gentle, learned, and refined Pope Clement VI. wasTheher best friend and a firm believer in her innocence,while the haughty, passionate Urban VI., althougha Neapolitanhimself, was one of herbitterestenemies.It is gready to be regretted that neither of hercelebrated contemporaries, Petrarch and Boccaccio,ever wrote her biography, for both knew her in-timately, and were in a position to throw light onher character, and on the mystery which darkenedher youth and cast a shadow on the whole of herBoth of these men of genius had a greatespecially Petrarch, who wasOne of the laterbiographers of this " famous princess—as famousas ever lived"—Giannone, calls her "the wisestone of her domestic chaplains.admiration for her,life.of princesses, the Light of Italy, and the Jewelof the World."Before we begin to tell the story of her life, itwill be as well to clear the ground by giving a briefsketch of her immediate predecessors on the throne,and, to help to the better understanding of sub-sequent events, to show the relation in which shestood to Andrew of Hungary and the princes ofAs many readers dislike retrospectiveTaranto.writing, this shall be done as shortly as possible.The crown of Naples passed from the houseof Swabia to the house of Anjou in 1269, whenIntroductory5the TwoCharles of Anjou was invested withSicilies—that is, the island of Sicily and the kingdomof Naples—by Pope Clement IV.Manfred, the illegitimate son of Frederick II. ofSwabia, was then acting as Regent for his nephewConradine, at that time a minor, and he sent am-bassadors to Charles I. to try to avert the loss ofthe Neapolitan throne.forcible than polite.Charles's reply was more" Go," he said, " and tell theSultan of Lucera from me, that I will either sendhim to hell, or he will send me to Paradise."Manfred was subsequently slainat the battleof Benevento, and Charles I., after being crownedin Rome, proceeded withoutoppositionto Naples ; but young Conradine now attempted toretain possession of his throne, aided by the Dukefurtherof Austria, and falling into Charles's hands wasexecuted with seven or eight of his followers ona scaffold covered with crimson velvet and erectedin the market-place of Naples.Charles of Anjou, a bold and ambitious king,was succeeded by his son, Charles II., Prince ofSalerno, who at the time was a prisoner in Spainand only obtained his liberty two years after hisfather's death, on condition of leaving his threeelder sons as hostages in Spain, where they werecompelled to remain twelve years.Charles II. was a true father to his people, andadministered the government of his kingdom with6The Beautiful Queena strict sense of justice, not suffering the Neapolitansto be oppressed by Provencal adventurers, as theyhad been in his father's reign.In the fourteenth century kings transferred theirrights to kingdoms, just as fathers divided theirchildren—by will ;among theirpropertyCharles II., whose wife, Maria of Hungary, hadbrought him the Hungarian crown, left Hungary toHisthe heirs of his eldest son, Charles Martel.andsecond son, St. Louis, the Bishop of Toulouse,died in his father's lifetime, at the age of twenty-three, and was afterwards canonised. To his thirdson, Robert, he left the Two Sicilies—that is, theisland of Sicily and the kingdom of Naples—andalso the duchies of Provence and Piedmont. Tohis fourth son he left the principality of Taranto,which embraced nearly half the kingdom of Naples,and to his fifth son, afterwards the Duke of Durazzo,a considerable part of the remaining half, so thatthe King of Naples was really only the chief ofprinces who, if they combined against him, wereas powerful as himself.Charles Martel's descendants never liked the dis-position of Charles II.

He was indeed almost too passionately8The Beautiful Queenfond of books for a sovereign in those warliketimes, and used to read even in his walks. Hewas a philosopher, a theologian, and a physician,but he had his limitations, for he despised poetryand was unacquainted with the works of his greatcontemporary,Dante. He was alsoabrilliantsoldier, and is said to have been an excellent orator.He married, at the age of eighteen, Violante,Princess of Aragon, by whom he had an only son,Charles Duke of Calabria, the father of Joanna, towhom he was most tenderly attached, and whom hetreated more as a brother than a son, making himhis companion and confidant, and entrusting himfrom his earliest youth with the government ofNaples, from which he was himself often called awayon military business.The Duke of Calabria was neither so learned astudent nor so celebrated a soldier as his father, but,like his grandfather Charles II., he was distinguishedfor his justice—a quality which he transmitted tohis daughter Joanna in an eminent degree. Twoanecdotes are told of him in connection with thisvirtue.He was in the habit of visiting all his dominionsonce a year, to see that his humbler subjects werenot oppressed by the great barons, and on oneoccasion he discovered that a certain Count hadtaken an estate by force from a vassal, because ithis own residence.affordedpleasantforsiteaIntroductory9Charles sent for the Count, and praising the lovelyview and beautiful situation of his house, begged himas a friend to give it up to him, that he might builda royal palace there, promising to pay the full priceThe Count angrily refused to dofor the property.anything of the kind ; but said if the Duke chose totake it by force he must do so, but, as he was famedfor his justice, he did not fear this alternative.The Duke replied, " Now you know what yourvassal must feel ; and unless you restore his landsimmediately, I will take your head as well as yourestates."Needless to say, the Count at once maderestitution to his vassal.Another of the Duke's customs was to sit everyday in the palace of justice, in front of the CastelNuovo, which his father built, and hear the pleas ofall his subjects who had any grievances ; and lestthe servants should prevent the poor from havingaccess to him, he had a large bell placed at theouter gate for the applicants to ring, that he mighthear it.One day an old horse, that belonged to a knightnamed Marco Capece, which was straying about therang the bell.city, rubbed itself against the wall, and inadvertentlyThe Duke ordered the porter tobring in the complainant, and amid the laughter ofthe court the man returned to announce that it wasonly Marco Capece's old horse.Charles, however, said thatahorsedeservedioThe Beautiful Queenjustice as well as his other subjects, and sent forthe owner and rebuked him severely for his neglectof an old and faithful servant, and ordered himto take better care of it, under pain of losing thepension he in a measure owed to it.It is a pity the Neapolitans do not take this oldstory to heart, for there is perhaps no cityEurope in which horses are worse treated than ininNaples.In 1326 Charles left Naples for Florence, whichhe had agreed to govern for ten years at the requestof the inhabitants, taking with him his wife, Mariaof Valois, his uncles, the princes of Taranto andDurazzo, sixteen of the great Neapolitan barons,and two hundred other knights with golden spurs,their wives and children.The princes and knightstravelled on richlycaparisoned horses, wearing cloaks of cloth-of-goldof various colours over their brilliant armour : theladies wore dresses and mantles of cloth-of-gold orsilver, or velvet or silk,eitherviolet,crimson,purple, or green, both material and colour beingThey travelled eitherdetermined by their rank.on horseback or in litters, or in springless chariotscovered with the gayest coloured velvet or someother costly material.Both knights and ladieswore for travelling long silk hoods embroideredwith grotesque devices, these were fastened underclasps, and hung downthe chin with jewelledIntroductory11behind in two long points almost reaching to theground.Each knight had at- least three squires, one ofwhom carried his master's arms on high. Hence theexpression " With a high hand."Another carried hishelmet on his saddle, and the third led his charger.This cavalcade is said to have been the mostmagnificent which had travelled through Italy sincethe fall of the Roman Empire.In its train were1,500 sumpter-mules of the barons, followed bylarge numbers of other animals carrying the baggageTheyof the knights, and a large body of infantry.started on May 31st from Naples, but stayed someweeks at Sienna, so they did not reach FlorenceHere they received a splendiduntil July 31st.reception, the streets being brilliantly decorated andtheir path strewn with flowers.The court of Joanna's mother, Maria, Duchess ofCalabria, at Florence was famed for its magnificenceand for the sumptuous entertainments, both banquetsand balls, given by the Duke and his wife.Mariaappears to have won the hearts of the Florentineladies, by a policy calculated to appeal to the femin-ine mind in all ages.It seems that the Florentinemen had forbidden their wives and daughters towear what they considered a disreputable ornamentof thick tresses of white and yellow silk, which theyarranged round their faces instead of their hair.InDecember, 1326, the Florentine dames petitioned12The Beautiful Queenthe Duchess to get her husband to repeal the sump-tuary law which forbade them to wear this hideoushead-dress, and the Duchess prevailed upon herThe Duke probably thoughthusband to do so.in this fourteenth century that " wilful woman musthave her way," just as it is allowed her as generallyin the twentieth.In the spring of 1327 Maria of Valois, Duchessof Calabria, gave birth to a prince, who died a fewdays after his public baptism, to the great grief ofall the royal family, for he was the heir to the throneof the Two Sicilies. The following December theDuke was recalled by his father, Robert, to Naplesrepelling an invasion of Louis theto assist inBavarian, Emperor of Germany. The next MarchJoanna was born.It must be remembered that in the fourteenthcentury the year began on March 25th, insteadof on January 1st, so that the date of the futureQueen's birth was 1327 according to the old styleof reckoning, 1328 according to the Gregorian ornew style—which, by the way, England was thelast country in Europe to adopt.It will not be uninteresting perhaps to pause fora moment to describe briefly the apartments ofthe Duchess of Calabria upon thisinterestingoccasion.There was a suite of three apartments. The firstwas called " the chamber of parade," and was hungIntroductory1 3with crimson satin, embroidered with gold ;thefloor was covered entirely withvelvet.This room contained one bed, curtained with crimsoncrimsonsatin, and with a counterpane of the same material.The bed was only used to accommodate Joannaupon the day of her baptism. A low chair and abuffet, under a canopy of crimson cloth-of-gold,completed the furniture of this apartment. Theshelves of the buffet were covered with the finestwhite linen, and on them stood flagons, cups, andvases of gold and silver.This ante-chamber opened into the bedroom ofthe Duchess, the walls of which were completelydraped with white silk damask hangings; curtainsof the same material were festooned over thewindows and doors and between and round thetwo beds, which stood five feet apart under oneThe counter-tester or canopy, similarly draped.panes of these beds were of ermine.This apartment also contained a huge buffet,which stood under a canopy of crimson cloth-of-gold ;the shelves were covered with the finestdamask cloths, and on them were placed crystalvessels, ornamented with gold and jewels, and neverused except upon these august occasions.Massivegold candlesticks stood at each end of the buffet,and the huge wax-candles in them were only lightedupon the entrance of visitors, but two smaller taperswere kept burning day and night for fifteen daysHafter the birth, during which period it was notThe Beautiful QueenEtiquette to admit daylight.The innermost room, which was assigned to thenew-born infant, was also draped in white silk, butof an inferior quality.Immediately Joanna was born she was placed inthe hands of Philippa the Catanese, who was destinedto play a tragic part in the drama of which Joannawas the heroine.In the same year that Joanna was born her fatherfounded the celebrated monastery of San Martino,between Naples and the Castle of St. Elmo.It wasone of the last acts of his life, for before the year wasended Robert the Wise and the Neapolitans wereoverwhelmed with grief by the death of the Duke,caused by a fever while engaged in his favourite sportof hawking.During Charles's last illness Robertsat day and night by his son's bedside, endeavouringto prolong his life by his own skill as a physician.When all remedies failed, and the unfortunate Duke,still in the prime of life, passed away, the Kingexclaimed : " The crown has fallen from my head.Woe to me, woe to you !"Charles had always been the darling of the peopleand the support of the throne, and his death was agreat blow to the nation, as well as to the King,who idolised his only son and the heirhiskingdom. The late Duke was a handsome man,of finefigure, courageous, though not fond oftoIntroductory51war ; his abilities were inferior to those of his fatherand daughter, but he was of an amiable dispositionwhich endeared him to every one.He was buried in the church of St. Clare, foundedby his father in 13 10. A story is told of the Dukeand his father with regard to this church, on whichRobert had expended immense sums of money, bothin building and ornamenting it. When finishedhe took. Charles to see it, and pointed out itsbeauties, to him ; then, suspecting from the Duke'smanner that he did not particularly admire it, heThe Dukeasked him what he thought of it.with more candour than tact said he thought it wasmore like a stable than a church." May it please God, my son, that you are notthe first to eat in this stable," said Robert, irritatedat Charles's criticism. As it happened, the poorDuke was the first member of his family to beburied in this church, which the Neapolitans took tobe the meaning of the rebuke.There was still a hope that Charles might besucceeded by a son, for Maria of Valois wasto her family when herexpectingadditionanhusband died ; but a few months after his deathshe gave birth to another daughter, who was namedMaria, and from that time Joanna was recognisedas her grandfather's heiress and successor.The Duchess only survived her husband threeyears.She died in 1321, leaving the two little61The Beautiful Queenprincesses, Joanna and Maria, to the care of theirgrandfather and his second wife, the devout QueenSancha.Maria, whose brother Philip of Valois,the first King of France of the house of Valois,came to the throne in 1328, left half her fortuneof sixty thousand francs, which she received fromher father, and half her lands in Naples, to eachof her daughters, but to Joanna she left the largestshare of her jewels, clothes, and personal effects.Little is known as to her character, beyond thefactof her popularity in Florence ; but she isbelieved to have been a good and virtuous princess,whose early death is to be lamented as it deprivedher children of a mother's care.
