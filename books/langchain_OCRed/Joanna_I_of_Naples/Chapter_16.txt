Herethe galleys which he had commanded Joanna, andthe Genoese, and the Venetians to provide for himmet him ; and the French Cardinals are said to havevented their grief at leaving France in loud criesand lamentations, and their anger in opprobriouslanguage to the venerable Pontiff, who paid noattention, but calmly ordered the sailors to set sailfor Genoa, where they met with a splendid receptionfrom all the princes and ambassadors, who wereassembled on the shore and knelt to receive thePapal benediction.Here under the blue Italian sky, on an improvisedaltar, Urban celebrated his first Mass in Italy, in theAt itspresence of an enormous crowd of people.Papal Court at Avignon, for the unhealthy palacein the squalid and disorderly streets of Rome.238The Beautiful Queenconclusion he proceeded on his journey to Rome,and, after some opposition at Viterbo, he reached theEternal City on October 16th.At his entry into Rome, more than two thousandbishops, abbots, and priors accompanied him ; hiswhite courser was led by Italianprinces, whileeleven French cardinalsfollowed, resigned andmelancholy, in his train. The bells of the city rangjoyously, the great doors of St. Peter's were thrown" rent the air, andopen, cries of " Evviva il Papa !then the Holy Father gave the blessing " Urbiet Orbi " from the balcony over the Golden Door.For over a year Urban resided in Rome, theobject of the greatest veneration in his spiritualcapacity, for which his personal sanctity so wellfitted him ; but in his temporal office as Sovereign ofthe city of Rome and of the Papal States he metDuringwith obstinate and insolent disobedience.his residence in Rome, at the beginning of Lent,1368, Joanna went to Rome to visit the Pope.She went partly from a pious desire to pay herhomage to the Holy Father in his capital, partlyto confer with him as her best friend and mostcompetent adviser, on the subject of her successor.Her sister Maria, who, although now the wife ofPhilip of Taranto, retained, as she was entitled todo, her higher title of Duchess of Durazzo, diedabout this time ; and, as Joanna had no children,Maria, according to the will of their grandfather,—Urban V. returns to Rome239the late King Robert, was the heiress to her sister'sItthrone.is true that the Duchess of Durazzohad three daughters ; but by the custom and lawof the age, they had no right to a throne whichtheir mother had never actually possessed.There now remained no descendants in the mainline of Charles of Anjou except Louis of Hungaryand Charles of Durazzo, son of Louis, Count ofGravina, of whose education, as we have said before,Joanna had taken charge.She had been a motherto this young Prince, who turned out so ungrateful,and as soon as he attained his majority he acceptedan invitation from Joanna's greatest enemy, Louis,King of Hungary, to fight with him against theVenetians, with whom he was now at war.disapproved of this most strongly ;but CharlesJoannafact made herdisregarded her wishes, and thishesitate to adopt him as her heir, for she knewLouis hated her, and would probably poison hernephew's mind against her.We can imagine how deeply this conduct ofCharles must have wounded Joanna, for there arefew things more galling than when those we havebelieved to be our friends become intimate with ourenemies ; and Joanna had been far more than afriend to Charles of Durazzo.She had been hisbenefactress and a foster-mother to him who nowbehaved in this mean and ungrateful way to herwhich, indeed, was but a prelude to the lower240The Beautiful Queendepths of treachery and basenessto which heafterwards sank.Joanna made the journey as far as Ostia by sea,and the remainder of the way by land, sometimesriding on horseback, sometimes being carried in alitter, but with great pomp and attended by a mag-This visit,nificent train of knights and followers.which brought her so much honour, was perhapsthe happiest period of her life ; she had left herkingdom at peace and in a prosperous condition,owing to her wisegovernment, so she had noanxiety about that in the background to mar herdelight in thespiritual and artistic treasures ofRome.Peter of Lusignan, King of Cyprus, met her ata little distance from the gates of the city, andconducted her under a rich canopy of state to theHere she was met by thePortacardinals, clergy, and principal nobles of Rome, whoPietro.S.were waiting to receive her and attend her to thesteps of St. Peter's Church.Urban V. infullpontificals was waiting here, and as she approached,he, wishing to confer a very great mark of honourupon her, descended some of the steps to meet thismajestic Queen and woman.Joanna dismounted from her horse, and made thethree customary genuflections to the Holy Father,who raised her from her knees and led her intothe church, up the nave to the tombs of the holyUrban V. returns to Rome241apostles Peter and Paul, to pay her devotions attheir shrine. An enormous crowd had been assem-bled outside the church in the Piazza to watchher arrival, and some of the people followed theprocession into the church on this unique occasion.Urban V. was a greater friend to Joanna thanhis predecessor Clement VI. had been ; and sincehe became a canonised saint of the church, andduring his lifetime was noted for his holiness, thisfriendship and respect, this affection and esteem ofthe Sovereign Pontiff, should have silenced the lipsof all her detractors ; for we may be sure that hadtheir vile reports, Urban V.there been truth inwould never have countenanced her, far less wouldhe have demonstrated his regard for her in theDuring her stay in Rome hepublic way he did.showed her every public mark of honour it was inhis power to bestow.For the second time in her life Joanna, on LetareSunday, received the Golden Rose—this time fromUrban V. after he had blessed it and worn it duringMass. To the surprise of all present, the Pope,at the conclusion of High Mass, turned to theQueen of Naples, who was near him, and presentedher with this coveted honour.It is said that theCardinals afterwards remonstrated with him becausehe had preferred Joanna to the King of Cyprus,who was also present, and objected that she was thefirst woman who had ever received this favour.16"242The Beautiful QueenUrban is reported to have replied in a severetone, which did not encourage any more remon-strance on the part of the Cardinals : " There wererules, and who had ever beforeheard of a poor Abbot of St. Victor at Marseillesexceptions to allbeing Pope ?On Easter Sunday Urban lavished yet a greaterfavour upon Joanna. He presented her with theblessed hat and sword, but she, with her customarytact and grace, noticing the deep mortification ofthe King of Cyprus, asked the Pope to bestow thesword upon him, and Urban consenting, she gaveit to Peter of Lusignan with her own fair hands,thus enhancing the gift, and retained for herself thepearl-embroidered hat.Joanna remained in Rome until after the Easterceremonies were over, and in the meantime, in thecourse of her interviews with Urban, had come tothe decision that the best way out of the difficultquestion of the succession to her throne would beto arrange a marriage between her adopted daughterMargaret, her sister Maria's youngest child, andCharles Durazzo, and then, if she found on hisreturn from Louis of Hungary that he was stillloyal toher,to leave the crown to him andMargaret.The two elder daughters of Maria were alreadymarried—Joanna,theDuchessof Durazzo, toRobert of Artois, and Agnes to Can della Scala,Urban V. returns to Rome243Prince of Verona ; and the Queen knew that to leaveher crown to either of them so long as CharlesDurazzo lived would be to leave them and herkingdom an inheritance of civil war, so she askedUrban for a dispensation to enable her adopteddaughter, Margaret, to marry her cousin, CharlesDurazzo.On leaving Rome she did not return to Naplesat once, but went to Provence and worked thereon reforming the laws of that country and Piedmont,and as soon as this was accomplished went backto her capital and celebrated with befitting pompthe marriage of her adopted daughter and CharlesJoanna was strongly attached to herDurazzo.nephew, who was, externally at least, a very attractiveman, with winning manners which effectually con-He was a fineto rashness, and though of smallcealed his falseness and cruelty.soldier, bravestature he had defeated in single combat soon afterhe went to Hungary a gigantic Hungarian knightwhom no other man had dared to challenge, andfrom that time he bore the head of an elephantas his crest, because that had formerly belongedto his vanquished foe.Charles was very generous, especially to men ofletters whom he patronised, and his conduct atthis time was so irreproachable that Joanna un-fortunately was deceived by it ;and after hismarriage with Margaret she issued a proclamation;244The Beautiful Queenof her intention of bequeathing her crown to thenewly married Prince and Princess, and to theirWhat must have been her feelings whenvery soon after this Charles returned to the serviceissue.of the King of Hungary, on whose support hecalculated should Joanna change her intentions withregard to her heirs ?Meanwhile Urban V. was finding the turbulentstate of Rome and the deleterious effect of theunhealthy climate upon his health so unbearablethat he resolved to return to Avignon, a measurewhich the Italian Cardinals opposed as strongly asthe French had objected to his leaving it. Theapplied to the Queen of Naples toPope againfurnish him with galleys for the voyage, whichshe willingly supplied.St. Bridget of Sweden, hearing of the Pope'sintention of returningtoFrance, demanded anaudience, and informed the venerable Pontiff thatit had been revealed to her by Our Lady that ifhe returned to Avignon he would die very shortlyafter.Urban paidno attentiontothis prophecyhaving made up his mind that he was acting forthe best in removing the Papal Court back toAvignon, he was not to be deterred from carryingout his intention by what he considered mightpossibly be a delusion on the Swedish mystic'spart.However that may be, itis certain thatp. 244]URBAN THE FIFTH.Urban V. returns to Rome245he lived only a few months after his return toFrance.When he felt his end approaching he ordered thedoors of his palace to be thrown open that all mightsee him die as he lay, in his Benedictine habit whichhe always wore, stretched on a wretched low bedwith his crucifix inhis feeble hands, making actsof humble contrition for all the sins of his past life.His death took place on December 19th, 1370.He was very infirm when St. Bridget uttered herprophecy, but he died of some unknown malady.He was deeply regretted by the Italians as wellas by the French.No less than eight hundred princes and noblesattended the Requiem sung at Bologna for his soul,and he was invoked as a saint immediately after itwas celebrated, before his cause of canonisation began.All the sovereigns of Europe, from Magnus II.of Sweden and Waldemar of Denmark in the northto Joanna in the south, demanded his canonisation,and his cause was greatly helped by the numerousmiracles attributed to him, in an age when morefaith was placed in miracles than in our scepticaltime, and by his great sanctity, for he is said evenby Protestant historians to have been a model ofHe made several greatly needed reformsvirtue.in the Church, among them a very wise and im-portant one forbidding the Cardinals to use theirhouses as sanctuaries for criminals.246The Beautiful QueenBy the death of Urban Joanna lost her best andmost powerful friend, although the consequences toher of this irreparable loss were not felt immediately.The conclave to elect his successor was held atAvignon, and the choice fell upon Pierre Roger deBeaufort, the last of the French Popes, a nephewof Clement VI. He took the title of Gregory XI.Shortly after his accession Joanna succeeded inputting an end to the strife which had disturbedthe Two Sicilies ever since the fatal day of themassacre known as the Sicilian Vespers. A treatywas entered into between her confessor the Bishopof Gravina on the one hand, and the first chaplainof Frederick of Aragon, then King of Sicily, on theother side, by which the latter consented to acknow-ledge Joanna as Queen of the Two Sicilies, and topay her a yearly tribute of three thousand ounces ofgold, on condition that she left him in peaceableFrederick was also boundpossession of the island.to furnish Joanna whenever she required them withten galleys and a hundred men-at-arms. He wasalso required to resign the title of King of Sicily,and to take that of King of Trinacria instead. Amarriage was also arranged between him and Maria,daughter of the Duke of Andria and of Joanna'ssister-in-law, Margaret of Taranto.Thus ended the long struggle for independence ofthe Island of Sicily, which now again acknowledgedan Angevine sovereign, Queen Joanna.
