He was a fine soldier,and highly distinguished in all the accomplishmentsof a mediaeval knight, such as jousts, tournaments,and field-sports.In fact, he had all the qualitiescalculated to win the hearts of the pleasure-lovingNeapolitans, but he did not possess the more solidvirtues of a faithful husband, at any rate inhislater years.Joanna is greatly blamed by her enemies forthe gaiety of her court, the lavish entertainmentsin which she indulged, the luxury of her table, thebrilliancy of her attire, and the constant round ofballs, banquets, pageants, tournaments, and otherfestivities on which she spent so much money ; butshe was eminendy a wise woman, and probably sheknew that this was the best way toretain herhusband's affections, which she succeeded in doingduring the first years of her married life.we shalllife that he shortened his days by his excesses.see, Louis led so wild and profligate aLater, asSo long as he was engaged in fighting Joanna'sThebattles for her Louis was a good husband.excitement of war kept him out of mischief, andsatisfied his energetic temperament and craving for—176The Beautiful Queenin the fourteenth century.excitement, without which he could not live evenWhat he would havedone in the twentieth century, when the craze forsomething new possesses old and young, rich andclasses of men and women, we do notOn first returning toNaples, with thepoor, allknow.Hungarians still in occupation, Louis had plentyof scope for his martial energy : he at once under-took an expedition against the Count of Apicia powerful baron who obstinately adhered to theHungarian cause, but was soon reduced to obedienceand heavily fined for his rebellion.One of the most audacious of the captains ofmercenaries, after our own Hawkwood, in thesedays was a German who went by the name ofDuke Warner.following legend embroidered inletters onhis surcoat : "I am Duke Warner, the Chief ofthe Great Company, the Enemy of God, of Pity,and of Mercy."This ruffian went about with thesilverThis blasphemous creature, who spread terrorwherever he went withhis band of pillaging,murdering, merciless adherents, was serving underwhen Louis defeated the Count of Apici.the Hungarian King's lieutenant, Conrad Wolf,As hehad three thousand horsemen under him, it wasvery important to enlist his services in Joanna'spossible, and Louis took the moneyto buy Warnerexacted from the Apici as a fineinterest ifPeace is Proclaimed177Louis now gained aover to the Queen's side.succession of small victories.

The12178The Beautiful Queenpeasants thronged into Naples armed with reapinghooks, scythes, spades—anything they couldhands on for want of proper arms — to try tolaydeliver their country from the hated Hungarians.The nobles, including the Count of Minervino, whohad originally been on the Hungarian side, nowcollected all the armed men they could muster, andpoured them into the city ; but unfortunately Wolfcut off the supplies of provisions from the Terradi Lavoro, so that the city was reduced to whatit could obtain by sea from Calabria and otherplaces.The Neapolitans, impatient at having their rationsreduced, and quite against the advice of Louis, whoknew they were not strong enough to give battle tothe Hungarians, allowed themselves to be trickedinto an engagement, in which many perished, forthey were surrounded on all sides by the enemy.The mercenaries whom the Hungarians had engagednow became dissatisfied with their wretched payment,and threatened to leave their employers in the lurch,so the Transylvanian General, Prince Stephen, de-livered into their hands in the place of money allthe prisoners of war whom they had taken.Theunfortunate prisoners were subjected to the mosthorrible tortures by these cruel bands, who wereTheguilty of rapine, murder, and every vice.prisoners paid large sums of money to ransomthemselves ; but the mercenaries, when they foundPeace is Proclaimed179they could not extortsufficientto satisfytheirgreed, resolved to take Stephen himself prisoner andtorture him in the hope of getting a larger sum ofmoney.Fortunately the Transylvanian prince waswarned of these intentions, and one night managedto effect his escape with some of his officers.Duke Warner had formerly been employed inthe service of the Church, so he was known to theCardinal Legate Ceccano, as were also other of theGerman officers ; and on his offering them 1 20,000florins, they agreed to deliver up the two townsof Aversa and Capua, and to go back to Germany.Louis of Taranto then fortified these two townsvery strongly, so that the following year Aversawas able to resist when besieged by the HungarianKing.Another celebrated character fighting on the sideof the Hungarians was Fra Moriale, a knight ofJerusalem, whose real name was Montreal D'Albano.He was a Provencal by birth, and had formerly beenin the service of Joanna's brother-in-law, the DukeHe now retiredof Durazzo.Apulia withConrad Wolf, and sent word to Louis of Hungarytothat the Germans had forsaken him and gone backto their own country.Fra Moriale's end was a tragic one, though itis rather anticipating events to mention it.Afterthe Hungarians had left Naples, Fra Moriale re-mained behind ; and collecting together a large band180The Beautiful Queenfinally makingof adventurers, he ravaged Italy,war against the Viscontis. He was taken prisonerin Rome, and, being brought before the tribunal ofRienzi, then in power, he was sentenced to death,and beheaded in 1354.On hearing that the Germans had left Naples,Louis of Hungary soon after entered Apulia witha large force of 10,000 horsemen, besides a numberof foot-soldiers. No sooner was Louis of Tarantoaware that his enemy was so near, than he sent hima challenge to decide the matter by single combatwith him, and gave him the choice of Naples,Avignon, Paris, or Perugia, as the scene of theencounter.Louis of Hungary agreed to accept the challenge,but objected to all the places named, as being toofavourably inclined to his adversary, and suggestedthat the duel should be fought in the presenceof the Bishop of Aquila, or of the Emperor ofGermany, or else in that of their common friend,the King of England, or in that of their respectivearmies, in which latter case there is every reason tosuppose the Hungarians would have been guiltyof some treachery.For some reason or other this duel never cameoff, and soon after the King of Hungary, whilebesieging the city of Canoza in Apulia, was danger-ously wounded and picked up apparently deadbefore the walls, and carried back to his own camp,Peace is Proclaimed181where he recovered and soon after captured Salerno.The citadel of Lucera was given up treacherouslyto him by the governor, and he then advanced toAversa, thinking to take that easily.He was, however, mistaken, and the siege of Aversalasted three months before Pignatello, the governor,was forced by starvation to capitulate on honourableterms.It was while the Hungarians were still invadingher kingdom that Joanna heard of the death of herlittle son by Andrew, Canrobert, the heir to herthrone, who it will be remembered had been sentto Hungary by Louis of Hungary soon after hefirst came to Naples. Some few months after Joannareturned to Naples from Avignon she gave birthto a daughter, who was baptized Francesca.Thechild was idolised by both her parents, and before shewas three years old a marriage had been arrangedfor her with the heir of the kingdom of Aragon.A year after the birth of the Princess FrancescaJoanna gave birth to another daughter, who wasnamed Catherine.She, however, died in infancy,and thenceforth all Joanna's hopes were concentratedupon Francesca, her only son having perished ina foreign land.After the capitulation of Aversa the Queen andher husband and child, with some faithful friends,went to Gaeta by sea, fearing that Louis of Hungary,now on his way to Naples, might take them prisoners,1 82The Beautiful Queenand hoping in case of necessity to be able to retreatto Provence, in ten galleys which were in waitingfor them at Gaeta.These ten galleys were not considered sufficient,so the High Admiral of the kingdom, Rinaldo deBaux, was ordered to bring eight more from Naples.Once more was Joanna threatened with treason ; forwhile she was waiting at Gaeta for the reinforce-ments her Admiral was commanded to bring, therearrived one day a messenger who desired a secretaudience of the Queen, in the course of which heinformed her that de Baux, who was supposed tobe laying in provisions before he left Naples, hadconcluded a bargain with Louis of Hungary bywhich he pledged himself to deliver Joanna andher husband and the little Princess Francesca, to-gether with Joanna's sister, Maria of Sicily, theDuchess of Durazzo, and her children, into the handsThe reward he askedof the King of Hungary.for this act of treachery was the hand of Maria'seldest daughter, the heiress of the principality otDurazzo, for his son.As soon as the Admiral and hisfleet reachedGaeta, Joanna sent a message to him to come atonce to the palace to see her, De Baux refused onvarious pretexts, and even declined to enter theharbour ; and as, so long as he remained outside withhis fleet, the flight of the Queen to Provence, ifit should become necessary was prevented, LouisPeace is Proclaimed183of Taranto decided upon very summary measures.He took three or four faithful friends with him, andembarking on board a small boat managed to geton board the Admiral's ship before he was aware ofhis approach ; and making his way into the traitor'spresence, Louis attacked him and slew him there andthen with his sword.It was a bold move, quitein keeping with the rough times and with thecircumstances.character of Louis, and perhaps justified by theIndeed, it seemed the quickest wayout of the dilemma in which de Baux's treacheryhad placed the Queen, who was fated so often inthe course of her adventurous life to suffer fromtreason.While thesehappening at GaetaLouis of Hungary had entered Naples with histhingswereragged, half-starved army, and had encamped onspot where now stands the Church of thetheIncoronata, afterwards built by Joanna.Naples was then divided into twelve sectionscalledPiazze, and from each of thesetwelvedivisions a proclamation was issued in which Louisof Hungary offered to save the city from destructionon condition of the people contributing a heavy fine,to compensate his soldiers for the plunder they wouldgain if he allowed them to pillage it.He called a meeting of the nobility and principalCastel Nuovo, and made the sameatcitizensproposaltothem, and rebuked them forthe—184The Beautiful Queenaffection they had shown their Queen and all theyThe sight of the miserablehad done for her.horses and soldiers of the Hungarian army, however,excited the ridicule of the Neapolitans, who collectedandtogether from everyquarter of thecity,threatened to give battle to their enemies if theyattempted the least violence, and absolutely refusedto give a penny to buy them off.Louis, thinking that his enfeebled troops wouldnot have much chance against the Neapolitans, whowere determinedto strainevery nerve to savetheir beautiful city, thought it prudent to retireto Apulia, and if possible join his forces to thoseof Conrad Wolf there.The Pope, hearing of this move, thought a favour-able time had arrived for him to try to concludepeace, as both sides were getting exhausted ; and,according to one account, he commanded Louis,under pain of excommunication, to leave Naplesor rather Joanna's dominions—at once, and allowJoanna and her husband to take possession of herkingdom.Louis proposed a truce for a year, and demandedanothertrialbeforethe Pope and Cardinals ofJoanna, promising, if she were declared innocentagain, to give up her kingdom to her, and Joannapromised to resign it if she were pronounced guilty.Of course Joanna was pronounced innocent asecond time—no one ever had any misgivings onPeace is Proclaimed185that score ; and the Pope then drew up a treatywiththe Hungarian ambassadors,in whichitwas stipulated that Louis of Taranto should notbear the title of King, and that if Joanna had nochildren to survive her, her rights were to pass toLouis of Hungary or his successors, to the exclusionof her sister, the widowed Duchess of Durazzo.The Hungarians signed thistreaty, but whenit was put before Joanna she refused absolutely toexclude her husband from the throne, or to signaway her sister's right of succession, or to submither people to the danger of the hated HungarianAs Joanna was firm, and it was evidentthat she would never yield, and would refuse toyoke.sign any treaty except one of whose terms sheapproved, the Pope gave way to her eloquence, anddrew up another treaty, in which the title of Kingwas granted to Louis of Taranto, and all the con-ditions as to the succession contained in the willof the late King Robert were agreed to ; the Popestipulating that Joanna should pay Louis a sum of300,000 florins for delivering up all the castles andfortresses he had captured in Naples.At this juncture Louis's haughtiness stood Joannain good stead, for with the pride of his race herefused to accept the money." No !" he cried : " not for the sake of lands andgold, but only out of revenge of the murder ofmy brother have I fought. My work is finished.1 86The Beautiful QueenThe angry shadows are reconciled.I desire nothingmore."Would not this conduct be sufficient to provethe innocence of Joanna if more proof were wanting ?for if she had been guilty of the murder of Andrew,Louis of Hungary had received no satisfactionfor it.The Pope and the Cardinals were much pleasedat this magnanimity on the part of the HungarianKing, and thanked him cordiallyit ; andforJoanna, as soon as the treaty was signed, sent anembassy to Clement to thank him on her partfor all the trouble he had taken on her behalf,and at the same time to beg him to issue a Bullfor her own coronation and for that of her husband.The Pope granted her request, issued the desiredBull, and sent the Bishop of Braganca to performthe ceremony of coronation on Whit-Sunday, whichthat year fell on May 25 th.
