CHAPTER XIIIThe Coronation of JoannaONE of the conditions of the treaty of peacebetweenJoannaand Louis of Hungarywas the liberation of all the princes of the bloodroyal, who had been sent to Hungary after themurder of the Duke of Durazzo, and had beenimprisoned now for four years in the castle ofVisgrade.TheirimprisonmenthadbeenforJoanna the soul of good in the evil of the invasionof her kingdom, for if they had been at liberty,their quarrels with each other and their ambitionwould have weakened her cause by creating divisionsin her realm, and it would have been better forJoanna if they had never been liberated, as it turnedout, for they were a turbulent set.Preparations were now made for the coronation,and people began to flock into Naples from allparts of the kingdom to witness what promisedto be a magnificent spectacle, for it was well known1871 88The Beautiful QueenthatJoannaloved pomp and grand functions.But not even Joanna's coronation was allowed totake place peacefully ; a serious disturbance tookplace just before it came off, and a great sorrowbefell her immediately after it was over.One of those mercenary bands which were oneof the terrors of the Middle Ages, commanded bya German named Beltram della Molta, waylaid anumber of the barons and their wives, who werenear Aversa, andcoronation,proceedingto therobbed them of the splendid dresses they wereabout to wear at it, and of all the jewels and othervaluables which they had brought with them.band of robbers was a thousand strong, all mountedmen, and the barons were powerless against them ;but Louis of Taranto, hearing of the outrage, wentin pursuit with five hundred knights, and succeededThisthedispersing allband, except Beltram andintwenty of his followers, who alone escaped, for thosewho were not slain by the swords of Louis and hisknights were killed by the peasants.The coronation took place on the Feast of Pente-cost in the chapel of the old Palais de Justice, whichwas afterwards included in the Church of the In-coronata, which Joanna built in 1352 to commemorateher coronation and her marriage with Louis ofTaranto.Pentecost was ever a favourite feast withthe Angevine family.After the High Mass, which was celebrated withThe Coronation of Joanna189all the grand ritual of the Catholic Church, thebeautiful and majestic young Queen and her hand-some husband, clad inviolet velvet robes (violetbeing the colour of the Neapolitan royal family),knelt before the Bishop of Braganca to receive theKing-consort.crown from his hands, Louis being crowned asThe splendid robes of the Kingand Queen and their courtiers and the handsomeclergy made avestmentsBishopandtheofmagnificent blaze of colour in the chapel on thisday, which is said to have been the happiest ofJoanna's life, although it was destined to end insorrow.After the ceremony was over Joanna and Louiswent in procession round the city,populace an opportunity of seeing them : they rodeto givetheon horseback, with their crowns on their heads, theirJust as they passedhorses led by two noblemen.the church of San Giorgio Maggiore, after comingthrough the Porta Nolana, where the hospital ofSan Giovanni now stands, some ladies threw someflowers from a balcony to greet them.

On theother hand, the French historian de Sade says hewas one of the greatest men who ever filled theChair of Peter, and that if he had some faults, theywere atoned for by great virtues and amiable qualities,and that he accomplished a great undertaking inwhichhispredecessors hadfailedâ€”namely,hedeposed theelected Charles of Luxembourg in his place.troublesome Louis of Bavaria andThisLouis of Bavaria was the great enemy of thei<? 2The Beautiful QueenPope John XXII., and had presumed to set upan antipope in his place after the Pope had ex-communicated him, and the Prince Colonna hadthe courage to affix the sentence to the walls ofBy the deposition of this Emperorthe Vatican.the great struggle, which had troubled the Churchso long, between the Papacy and the Empire wasended.Petrarch says of Clement VI. that none meritedby his actions.better the name of Clement, which was well deservedAn example of his clemency isgiven by his biographers which well illustrates thistrait in his character. A person who had grievouslyoffended him once ventured to ask a favour ofhim ; the Pope was tempted to seize the opportunityof revenging himself by refusing to listen to hisrequest, but he resisted the temptation and grantedthe favour.He was very eloquent, and spoke with greatfluency and dignity. He succeeded in the difficulttask of reconciling Joanna and the King of Hungary,and in obtaininga truce between the Kings ofFrance and England, whose wars disturbed hisreign. He just failed to reconcile the Greek andLatin Churches, for which he laboured with greatwisdom and prudence.His conduct during theGreat Plague, when his charity and generosity wereso conspicuous, may well atone for faults of worldli-ness and love of luxury, which made him refuse toThe Coronation of Joanna193transfer the Papal See back to Rome, even at thebidding of the great Swedish saint and mystic,St. Bridget, Princess of Nericia.Another of Clement's good actions was that heordered Casimir, King of Poland, who was leading amost immoral life, to send away his mistresses and toThe King refused at first todo this, but he afterwards submitted, and performedthe penance the Pope imposed upon him.never liked Clement, and often satirised him becausebe faithful to his wife.Petrarchhis luxurious life was so unlike that of the Apostles,so his remark quoted above about his clemency isthe more valuable.Upon the death of Clement, the Cardinals, seeingthe need for reform in the Church, and thinkingthat the new Pope should be a man of austere life,turned their eyes upon a very holy Carthusian monknamed John Birel, who was at that time Generalof his Order, the strictest in the Church. He wasa native of Limousin, and was famed for his sanctityof life, and his zeal in preaching repentance, and hiscourage in exhorting kings and princes with theutmost frankness and severity.One of theCardinals, named Talleyrand, anancestor of the diplomatist, tookalarmattheprospect of so strict a successor to Clement, andsaid to the other Cardinals :" What are you going to do ?Don't you seethat this monk, accustomed to govern anchorites,J 319 6The Beautiful Queenfrequently declined.Nearly the whole of the poetryof Zanobi has been lost ;

butatthe time of Joanna's coronation, the King Frederickbeing a minor, the Sicilians were governed by aregency, who so oppressed the people that a partyrebellion against it, headed by Simon,aroseCount of Chiaramonte, who was in fact, though notinin name, the ruler of the whole of the most fertilepart of the island.This party, three years afterthe coronation of Joanna and Louis, appealed tothem to send them provisionsto ward off animpending famine, and troopstohelp them toresist their oppressors.Naples being now prosperous, the Queen sentThe Coronation of Joanna197them an abundance of provisions,but astherivalry of the Princes of Taranto and Durazzoconstantly led to fighting between them, Joannacould only send them a hundred men-at-arms underNicholas Acciajuoli, and four hundred horsemenunder Raymond de Baux, while Louis remainedat home to defend his rights there.The following year, Naples being quieter, Louiswas able to take a small army into Sicily, and therehe fought so valiantly that he soon made himselfmaster of nearly all the island, except Catania andits neighbourhood.Frederick, the young King,was in Catania, and for three months the Neapolitansbesieged the city under Raymond de Baux, whomboth Joanna and Louis loved as a father.In the meanwhile Joanna, on Christmas Eve, 1356,came across from Naples and made a solemn entryHere they were crownedinto Messina with Louis.King and Queen of Sicily, and afterwards receivedthe allegiance of the Messinese and of the chiefbarons of the island.Here we will make a brief digression to tell theromantic story of a lady of Messina, who was oneof the Illustrious Women of Boccaccio and livedin Joanna's time, though she was many years olderHer name was Camiola Turinga,than the Queen.she was very rich and was as good as she wasbeautiful, and when she was young and unmarried,a young and handsome Prince of Aragon, named198The Beautiful QueenOrlando,excitedhercompassion.During thereign of his brother Peter, King of Sicily, Orlandohad, against his brother's express command, givenbattle to the Neapolitan fleet, and had lost all hisown ships and was taken prisoner and cast intoa Neapolitan dungeon in one of their castles, fromwhich Peter refused to ransom him, and, but forthe compassion of Camiola, he would probably havebeen doomed to pass his life in this durance vile.She, wishing to procure his liberty, sent a messengerto his prison in Naples to offer to pay his ransomif, in return, he would promise to marry her onhis release.Orlando, delighted at the prospect of regaininghis freedom, willingly signed a contract of marriage,and Camiola paid his ransom ; but no sooner wasthe prince set free than he absolutely refused tomarry her, and treated her with scorn and haughtycontempt.Camiola now appealed to the King Peter, whodecided that Orlando belonged to Camiola, as bythe law of the land he was now her slave, whomshe had bought with her money, and a day wasfixed for the marriagetotake place.Orlandoarrived on the day fixed with a splendid, princelyretinue, and went to Camiola's house, where hefound her dressed as a bride in magnificent attire,and wearing costly jewels ; but instead of, receivinghim with signs of affection, she told him she wouldThe Coronation of Joanna199scorn to ally herself with a man who had brokenhis knightly word and disgraced his royal birthand violated the sacred laws of chivalry, and thatall that she could do for him was to make him apresent of the ransom she had already paid, seeingthat all he cared for was money ; she would hence-forth dedicate herself and her fortune to Heavenand enter a convent.Orlando pleaded for forgiveness, but she refusedto listen or to change her mind, and the prince,who was shunned by all honourable men, his equals,fell into a state of depression and died not longafter, friendless and forlorn.But to return to Messina in 1356. When Joannaarrived at the Castle she found the two sistersof the King of Sicily, the Princesses Bianca andViolante, were imprisoned there : she at once hadthem liberated and treated them as her own sisters.The King Frederick was very delicate, and in caseTheof his death Bianca was the heiress of Sicily.Count de Chiramonte askedforher hand inmarriage as soon as she was liberated, as a rewardfor his services ; but Joanna and Louis dared notconsent to this, in case the young King should die,so they refused their consent, but offered Chiramontethe Duchess of Durazzo instead.This would havebeen a splendid match for the Count ; but he dieda few days after the Queen's refusal to his proposalforthePrincessBianca, which he had deeply200The Beautiful Queenresented.His family also were so angry at hisrejection that they all went back to their allegianceto the house of Aragon, and left Joanna in thelurch.At the end of three months de Baux was obligedto raise the siege of Catania, as he had not sufficientmeans to pay the Sicilian troops who had joined him,and after some fighting, in which he was at firstvictorious, he was eventually defeated and takenprisoner by the Catanians, who were superior innumbers.Acciajuoli escaped by the skin of histeeth, but de Baux was confined in the Castle ofThe Queen had not sufficient money toFrancavilla.of money, for his release.ransom her faithful servant, so she sold her jewelsand offered the proceeds, which were a large sumThe Regency, however,refused to accept the money, and asked instead thatthe two Princesses Bianca and Violante, who werevery happy with Joanna, should be exchanged forde Baux.This exchange was agreed to by the Queen, andthe two Princesses were setat liberty ; but thegovernor of the castle in which the High Admiralwas confined declined to release him, notwithstand-ing the orders of the Regency, and demanded anadditional ransom of two thousand ducats, whichthe Queen paid.Unfortunately, during the absence of the Queen andLouis war had broken out between Louis of DurazzoFrom an early woodcut portrait, by kind permission of Mr. St. Clair Baddeley.JOANNA THE FIRST, QUEEN OF NAPLES.p. 200]The Coronation of Joanna201on one side, and Louis's eldest brother, the PrinceThe Count of Minervinoof Taranto, on the other.(who, it will be remembered, had been released fromthe perpetual imprisonment to which he had beencondemned in the reign of King Robert) now joinedLouis of Durazzo ; and as this civil war was ravagingthe kingdom, Joanna and Louis of Taranto wereobliged to leave the conquest of Sicily, which theywould otherwise have completed, and return toNaples to restore peace there.On their arrival they summoned the Prince ofthe Count ofThe PrinceMinervino to appear before them.Taranto, Louis of Durazzo, andof Taranto at once obeyed, and submitted to theQueen's authority ; but Louis of Durazzo absolutelyrefused to come into the presence of either the Kingor the Queen, or to yield them any obedience. TheCount of Minervino appeared at court, but behavedin so haughty a manner and made such unreason-able demands that the sovereigns had no choice butto oppose him on the battlefield. He was veryrich, for he and his brothers, the other Pipini, hadacquired great wealth by their former ravages, andthey were assisted by the barbarian mercenaries theyhired.The throne was now in great danger, and a civilwar ensued which disturbed the country ; but in theend the Queen's forces were happily victorious, andThe Countthe Pipini destroyed root and branch.202The Beautiful Queenof Minervino was taken prisoner, and condemnedOne of histo the ignominious death of hanging.brothers was thrown down from a high tower byone of his own soldiers, and the third of the Pipinimanaged to escape from Naples, but was neverafterwards heard of, and is believed to have perished.Thus this family, which had given so much troubleto the late King as well as to Joanna, was at lastexterminated.The Queen, with her usual generosity, grantedLouis of Durazzo a free pardon, on account of hisroyal birth and relationship to her. A great banquetwas given in the Bishop's Palace by Louis andJoanna tomembers of the royal family were invited to becelebrate thereconciliation.All thepresent, and after the banquet the whole of theNeapolitan nobility attended the King in a royalprogress round the city.For several days tournaments and jousts were heldto amuse the people, and in the evenings what werecalled " solemn balls " were given at court, at whichthe majestic Queen was the most striking figure andthe object of universal admiration.This took placein 1359.In the followingyearthe haughty Louis ofDurazzo died, and Joanna undertook the educationof his eldest son, Charles, whom she afterwardsunfortunately adopted as her heir, for he turnedout a traitor and the worst of her enemies, in spiteThe Coronation of Joanna203of all the affection she lavished upon him. He wasa child of twelve at the time of his father's death.About this time Joanna adopted her sister Maria'syoungest daughter, Margaret, whom CharlesDurazzo afterwards married, and brought her up asher own daughter.Maria resigned her to Joannaofthe more readily because, soon afterthepeacecelebrations were concluded, she married a secondtime, her second husband being Philip of Taranto,the younger brother of Joanna's husband Louis.Thus the two sisters were now married to twoThe little Princess Margaret was only afew months younger than the child Joanna had lostbrothers.on the day of her coronation, and no doubt helpedto console her for that loss. The unhappy QueenLouis of Taranto, nowneeded consolation, forthere was no more fighting to be done, seems tohave grown tired of Joanna, and to have been un-faithful to her, and given himself up to intemperanceand other vices while Acciajuoli was continuing thewar in Sicily.It was at this time that the Neapolitan courtwas at its gayest.Pageants, balls, tournaments andbanquets, and all kinds of gaiety were the orderof the day, into all of which Louis entered with suchextravagance that he ruined his constitution, and,about three years after the defeat of the Pipini, hedied at Castel Nuovo of a fever in May, 1362, andJoanna was left a widow for the second time.
