CHAPTER XVThe Death of AcciajuolirT~,HE shadows in Joanna's life were beginningto deepen again ; the prolonged absence ofthe man she had married to guard her fair name*and be a helpmeet to her was a source of graveanxiety and trouble, for she did not know whetherhe was alive or dead, in prison or at large.About this time—that is, in the summer of 1367—there arrived in Naples the celebrated prophetessand mystic, the afterwards canonised Saint Bridgetof Sweden, with her beautiful young daughterCatherine, also a widow, her friend Nicholas Orsini,and a small band of Swedish pilgrims in her train.The Neapolitan nobility vied with each other intheir eagerness to show hospitality to the SwedishPrincess, the fame of whose sanctity and of hervisions and her prophesies and revelations hadalready reached them, for they were the talk ofEurope.The honour of entertaining so distinguished aThe Death of Acciajuoli223visitor fell upon Jacqueline nee Acciajuoli, sister toand wifeNicholas Acciajuoli, the Grand Seneschal of Naples,TheCountess was a very devout woman, and the simplethe Count Buondelmonte.toausterity of her menage, together with her high rankandtheimportant placesheoccupiedattheNeapolitanCourt,madeher houseagreeable to the Princess of Nericia.peculiarlyFrom theCountess the saint learnt the story of Joanna's life,the murder of Andrew and its consequences, hersecond marriage with Louis of Taranto, and her thirdnuptials with the handsome King of Majorca ; sheheard too of the brilliancy of Joanna's court, of thesplendour of her banquets, " solemn balls," " Courtof Love," tournaments, and other entertainments,renowned all over Europe for their magnificence ;she heard of theenvies and jealousies, of thequarrels and constant warfare of the royal princesof the houses of Durazzo and Taranto, of thefeuds between the nobles : and, as she had alreadyadmonished and threatened with divine vengeanceMagnus II., King of Sweden, and his Queenoncegayof whoseBlanche,courthadshebeenGrand Mistress,she now determined totryanceto reform Joanna's court, and preach repent-to the Queen herself and to all her gaycourtiers.St. Bridget was a great reformer, not only ofmonasteries and convents, of monks and nuns, of224The Beautiful Queenbishops and clergy, but she had not scrupled toAvignon, and was atremonstrate with the Popes for their residence atthis moment on the vergeof inducing Urban V. by her counsels to return toRome.Joanna, who if she liked gaiety was neverthelessa devout and faithful Catholic, was anxious to seethe mystic, of whom she had heard so much, andwith whom she had corresponded.The Queenhad probably read some of St. Bridget's Revelations,and soon after the arrival of the Swedish pilgrimsan audience was arranged.The saint, who was of very small stature, and wasclad in a nunlike costume of coarse serge, with ablack veil on her head, which hid her still gloriousgolden hair—which is said to have clothed her likea mantle when unbound—was presented by theCountess Buondelmonte to the majestic NeapolitanQueen, who was dressed in her usual magnificentstyle, and was surrounded by a group of admiringattired, many ofcourtierswhom were in love with her and all were ready toequally magnificentlydie in her cause.St. Bridget then presented her daughter Catherine,clad also in the nunlike widow's dress of the period,who was herself so beautiful that several Romannoblemen had attempted to carry her off by forcein Rome. But Catherine and Joanna never seem tohave liked each other, whereas in spite of St. Bridget'sThe Death of Acciajuoli225most severe admonishments, Joanna became greatlyattached to her, and promised the saint to reformher court, and to lead a much stricter life in future.A sort of religious revival in Naples seems to havebeen the outcome of this visit of the Swedish saintto that city.She became the rage : the Neapolitannobles willingly left their palaces to stand with thepoor and infirm who besieged the Buondelmontemansion, to wait their turn for an interview with theThey and their wives and daughterstook to visiting the poor and the hospitals andprophetess.tending the sick as Bridget and Catherine were wontto do in Rome ; the reported miracles wrought bySt. Bridget in healingthe sickcreated a greatsensation ; the churches were crowded.In short,Naples went from one extreme to the other, fromthe extreme of gaiety tothe opposite pole ofdevotion, and, as might have been expected, afterthe departure of the saint relapsed into its formernormal condition.But before the Swedish pilgrims quitted NaplesSt. Bridget established her claims to the gift ofprophecy in a remarkable manner.She was sitting with Jacqueline Acciajuoli one day,when she suddenly told her that the days of herbrother Nicholas, the Grand Seneschal of the king-dom, were already numbered, and his death imminent.Greatly shocked, Jacqueline, who was devoted to herbrother, at once went in search of him, and found15226The Beautiful Queenhim with the Queen, treating with her concerningthe ransom of her husband the King of Majorca,then in captivity in Spain.Nicholas was apparentlyin excellent health ; he was only about fifty-six, anda strong man, but that very night he was takensuddenly and seriously ill.St. Bridget was sent for,and watched and prayed at his bedside, where shefell into one of her ecstasies, and received one of therevelations for which she was so famous, whichshe afterwards wrote down and gave to her confessorto translate into Latin.The Grand Seneschal died in her presence afterreceiving the Last Sacraments, her exhortations andprayers having moved him to deep repentance forHis death took place onthe sins of his past life.October 25th, 1367, a few days after St. Bridgethad prophesied that it was imminent.He was buried in the magnificentCarthusianmonastery near Florence, which he had built, andto which he had already sent a library of veryvaluable manuscripts, having hoped soon to retirefrom office and end his days in peace and retirementThe cause of his death is described as thethere.bursting of an abscess in his head, but the vagueand scanty medical knowledge of the times cannotbe relied upon for a right diagnosis of his somewhatgitis.mysterious end.Perhaps it was an attack of menin-His death was a most serious loss to theQueen, for he was one of her most faithful coun-From an engraving by B.

He was also a verydevout man, most charitable and generous to theChurch.On one occasion he quarrelled with John Barrili,also a very able man, a poet and a great favouriteof the late King Robert, who chose him as hisproxy on the occasion of the crowning of Petrarchwith laurel in the Capitol.Petrarch heard of thisquarrel from the Bishop of Florence, on the occasionalready mentioned on which he dined with the poet." I am grieved at this quarrel ; you are the friend ofboth, and should make it up between them," saidthe Bishop.Petrarch undertook the task of reconciliation, andset about it in a somewhat elaborate fashion, thoughone that was highly characteristic of him. He wrotethree long letters—a private one for each of theoffended friends, and one to both united to beopened only by the two together and read.Allthree letters urged the strongest reasons for theirreconciliation, and he ended the private epistles byhoping that they would give a whole day to theThis happened manyreading of the third letter.years before the Grand Seneschal's death, for theywere dated May 24th, 1352. The Bishop undertookto deliver the letters, and some months afterwards hewrote to Petrarch to tell him his letters had had thedesired effect, and a reconciliation had taken place.228The Beautiful QueenAcciajuoli left four sons by his wife Margareta,besides two adopted children.Soon after Acciajuoli's death King John of France,having failed to secure Joanna's hand for his son,made an attempt to take Provence from her byforce ; but her wisdom and tact again stood her ingood stead, and the Pope supported her so zealouslyand her Provencal subjects showed such fidelity toher, that the Duke of Anjou, who had based hisclaims on some rights which he supposed hadaccrued to him through the ancient Kings of Aries,was defeated at the end of six months, althoughduring this time he had offered the largest bribesto the Provencal barons to tempt them and corruptOne of these barons,their allegiance to Joanna.Rainier of Grimaldis, Prince of Morguez, behavedwith great loyalty to Joanna ; she had given hima present of 4,000 florins for recapturing TarasconThe Duke of Anjou offered to givefor her.Grimaldis the same sum annually if he would goover to the French side, but he refused with scornto consider such treachery to his Queen.Even at Avignon the influence of the Anglo-French war was felt, and the policy of John ofUrban V.France was galling to the French Pope.now made a league with the King of Hungary,Joanna, and others against the Viscontis, who hadfor years been in rebellion against the Holy See.Barnabas Visconti, who was renowned for his crueltyThe Death of Acciajuoli229and the exorbitant demands he made upon the Pope,when he heard of this league, said, "They are allI will have them all whipped."Ambrose Visconti this same year entered Napleschildren ;with what was then considered an enormous forceof 1,200 lancers, each of whom had a number offollowers who were not counted in estimating theThey seized on a portionsize of Visconti's army.of the Abruzzi, and robbed and plundered the in-habitants without mercy.Joanna sent only a small force at first againstAmbrose (who was called the Bastard of Milan),under Giovanni Malateca ; but finding this wasinsufficient, she summoned all the veterans whohad formerly served under her late husband, Louisof Taranto, and riding out to meet them addressedan eloquent speech to them, exhorting them to dotheir utmost to deliver their country as speedily aspossible from these cruel barbarians who were killingtheir countrymen and ruining the land by theirrapine.She then wrote to the chief barons in her kingdomto the same effect, and so successfully that in afew months the Milanese army was cut up, onlybetween two and three thousand of Visconti's menescaping from the country ; while Ambrose Viscontihimself was taken prisoner, and confined in one ofthe Neapolitan castles, Castel Nuovo, for ten years.Some writers have blamed Joanna for treating this230The Beautiful Queenenemy with too great severity, but he was such adangerous, turbulent man that he was better in cap-tivity than free.Urban V. now issued a Bull of Excommunicationagainst the Visconti, and sent two legates with itto Galeazzo Visconti ; but he not only paid no atten-tion to this sentence, but forced the two legates toeat in his presence the parchment on which theBull was written, and also the seals, which are saidto have been leaden, and the cords.It seems that about this same year, 1367, Joannaheard of the death of her husband, James of Majorca;but according to Mr. Baddeley, who has writtena most scholarly essay on the Life and Times ofJoanna, 1 his death occurred much later than this.This writer says that James's death took place atSoria, in a Franciscan monastery there, in the year1375-Caraccioli puts his death at 1368, and Froissartsays it took place at sea on his voyage home fromWhether alive orSpain to Naples about 1376.dead he was dead to Joanna from the time he lefther after she had ransomed him, and for manyyears she was unaware of his fate, which was acause of great anxiety to her. From 1367 reportswere coming constandy to Naples that he was dead,and they did Joanna much harm in many ways.1 " Queen Joanna I., An Essay on her Times," by St. ClairBaddeley.London, 1893.The Death of Acciajuoli231Those pests the freebooters no sooner heard thatshe was again a widow than some of their com-panies, of which Ambrose Visconti's was one, laidplans for the invasion of Naples ; but after he wastaken prisoner Joanna enjoyed a period of com-parative rest and peace, during a reign which hasbeen described as one long effortto keep herthrone.Her wisdom and prudence, however, succeededin suppressing brigandage and robbery till the cavesof Calabria were as safe, we are told, as her ownTo accomplish this she had to exerciseseverity, and a royal edict was passed ordering thatpalace.when a band of brigands or marauders was taken,who had been strong enough to fortify themselvesin any castle, they were to be publicly executedas criminals, and this had a salutary effect, whichBoccaccio thus describes :" The rich man as well as the poor could traverseby night or day with perfect security not only townsand villages, but also the wildest forests, mountains,or caverns, and this the predecessors of Joanna wereeither not willing or not able to accomplish. Andwhat is not less salutary, by the modesty of her ownmanners she has reformed the licentiousness of hernobility, and so curbed their pride that those whoformerly paid little regard to their kings, to-daydread the frown of an offended woman."Robbery was the most prominent vice of Europe232The Beautiful Queenat this time, and it existed in greater excess in manyparts of Italy than elsewhere ; even in the time ofthe good King Robert, Naples was notorious forSo little was then thought of it thatits thieves.what was called " living by the saddle " was quitea gentlemanly profession in most European countries.Joanna did completely away with this reproach asfar as Naples was concerned, and did all she couldto help and civilise (her people by encouragingcommerce. To this end she built four streets toaccommodate the inhabitants of the four nationswho traded most with the capital, namely, the Pro-Venetians,, and theSpaniards,vencals,thetheGenoese.Naples under Joanna's rule became the favouriteport of traders, partly for the security of the roads,partly for the exemption from all taxation and fromany forced loans, which in no emergencies wouldThe city was suppliedshe ever suffer to be levied.not only with all the necessaries of life, but alsowith luxuries from foreign countries, for Joannawas a liberal patroness of every kind of art.Ina catalogue of the furniture, etcetera, of FonthillAbbey there is mentioned a magnificent Orientalchina vase, the earliest specimen of its kind knownin Europe, which once belonged to Joanna, whosearms are engraved upon it.She took pride in making her court as celebratedas King Robert's had been for learned and scientificThe Death of Acciajuoli233men, whom she freely admitted to her society inBoccaccio, whoprivate life as well as at court.after Petrarch was the most celebrated of her con-temporaries in literature, says, " She was so gracious,gentle, compassionate, and kind that she seemedratherthe companion than the Queen of thosearound her."In those days theology ranked first of all studies,but after that law was the most esteemed in Joanna'scourt, for her first care was to protect the pooragainst the rich, the weak against the strong ; andfor this purpose she consulted the most eminentbarristers and lawyers the University of NaplesThere were three most famous juris-could supply.consults whom Joanna commanded in an edict,using the language of her period, should be reveredin her dominions " as a human Trinity when in-These three were Luke ofterpreting the laws."Penna, Andrew of Isernia, and Nicholas of Naples,After the death of Andrewall very famous men.of Isernia, Joanna in all difficult questions used toapply to the most celebrated foreign legal authori-Baldus of Perugia and Angelus ofties for advice.the same city, on whom the most extravagant termsof praise were lavished, were two of these, andboth were enthusiastic admirers of the Queen ofSicily, not only as a wise sovereign and legislatrix,but also as a beautiful woman and a most charmingcompanion.234The Beautiful QueenAstrology was in the Middle Ages studied withastronomy, and at Naples there was a chair ofsciences.astrology at the University, as well as for otherMuch faith was placed in casting ofhoroscopes and the observation of the stars, whichwere supposed to foretell the destinies of men andwomen.Diseases were also believedto be in-fluenced by the celestial bodies, and in consequencephysicians were generally astrologers, but the massof the medical profession in those days were whatwe ashould have calledcentury agoquacks.Petrarch had very little faith in the prescriptionsHe says, "Theof themoment I see a physician I know beforehand whathe will say to me, ' Eat young poultry, drink warmdoctors of histime.water, use the remedy the stork has taught us.'"They might and did give worse advice than toeat young poultry and to drink warm water, butwhat the cryptic allusion to the teaching of thestork may mean we do not know, and perhaps wehad better not inquire. Two lessons taught bythe stork certainly might be followed with advan-tage—to be good mothers, and to take care of ourparents in their old age.Fruit was a prohibitedarticle of diet in sickness in the Middle Ages, butPetrarch struck at this medical advice, and lamentsthatphysicians seemed toregard itasequallypoisonous with henbane and aconite.Watches and clocks were in use at this period,;The Death of Acciajuoli235but the pendulum was not invented until the timeof Galileo ; until then it was the dial which revolved.Spectacles were also in common use.One of themost celebrated inventions of Joanna's reign is saidto have been the mariner's compass ; the first thatwas constructed in Europe was made by GiojaFlavio, a mathematician of Amain, near Naplesbut the idea is believed to have been brought fromChina by Marco Polo in the thirteenth century,and the Chinese had probably understood the useof it for two thousand years before.Flavio's com-pass had eight points only, and the arms of thedistrict in which he was born bear a compass witheight points in memory of him.The most celebrated theologian in Joanna's king-dom was Paris of Pozzuoli, who has left a mostenthusiastic panegyric upon Joanna behind him ;but perhaps if the Queen of Naples had been con-sulted she would have desired no higher compli-ment than to be called, as she so emphatically is," the friend of Petrarch and Boccaccio," and equallythe friend of two Popes, Clement VI. and Urban V.
