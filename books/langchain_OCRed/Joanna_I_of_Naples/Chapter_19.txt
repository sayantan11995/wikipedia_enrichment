CHAPTER XIXThe Beginning of the Great SchismTHE prophetic fears of Pope Gregory XI. weredestined to be only too well fulfilled, andwhen the Conclave met to elect his successors thisbecame apparent.Before the Cardinals assembled,deputations of Roman citizens approached manyof them, to beg them to elect a Roman or at leastThey beganan Italian to the Chair of Peter.theinterviewwithentreaties, and endedwiththreats.Later in the proceedings the Romans obtainedthe office of guarding the Cardinals, and proceededto do this very thoroughly ; for they took possessionof the sails and rudders of all the boats on theTiber, to prevent any of them from escaping thatway until they had elected an Italian Pope. Whenthe Conclave was sitting the noise of the mob, whoblew on trumpets and played upon tambourines, andshouted and yelled, and hissed and cheered, deafened276The Beginning of the Great Schism277them ; but had they felt their lives were in danger,they could easily have hired some mercenaries todefend them, and the fact that they did not do sopoints to the validity of the election which followed,and shows that they were not intimidated into makingchoice of an Italian Pope, as was afterwards maintainedby the adherents of the antipope.On April 6th a terrific thunderstorm broke overthe city, and a thunderbolt fell upon the cell of theSpanish Cardinal, Pierre de Luna, of Aragon, anda rumour spread that he had been elected ; and somuch damage was done by the storm to the Vaticanthat it was difficult to instal the Cardinals, andthe Conclave had to be postponed for twenty-fourhours.On the7th, when the Conclave met again atfour in the afternoon, the piazza of St. Peter's wascovered with a crowd of ao,ooo people, who shoutedat the Cardinals as they entered, " We will haveGive us an Italian Pope or wean Italian Pope !shall know what to do !"Of the four Italian Cardinals in the Conclave,Cardinal Orsini was too young to be elected—hewas then only twenty-four—and Piero, Cardinal ofSt. Peter's, was too old, and suffered from gout sobadly that he had to be carried across the squareinto the palace. On the night of the 7th the mobbroke into the Vatican and found access to the Papalcellars, and got tipsy on Canary and Chianti, and278The Beautiful Queenthreatened the lives of the Cardinals, demandinga Roman Pope ; but the Cardinals would not beintimidated, and Orsini told them that if they wereto elect any one through fear of them, the electionwould be ipso facto null and void.Now there was an outsider, Nicholas Prignano,a Neapolitan, the Archbishop of Bari, who hadbeen consulted by the Cardinals before they enteredinto the Conclave, and who had also taken part in thedeliberations of the Bannerets on the same subject,and before the Conclave a good many of the Cardinalswere prepared to vote for Prignano, and eventuallydid so on April 8 th, and he, being elected by fifteenvotes, took the title of Urban VI.The new Pope belonged to a noble Neapolitanfamily, and was not only a very eloquent, capable,wise man, but at the time of his election he wasalso very good and pious, humble and mortified, andwas held in high esteem by his countrymen, andespecially by his Queen, Joanna, who had a verygreat regard for him.While the Conclave was sitting Thomas d'Acerno,Joanna's attorney, who was in Rome, wrote to oneof her chamberlains to say that the Archbishop ofBari stood a very good chance of being elected ;and when the news of his exaltation to the highestearthly dignity actually came to Naples, the Queenand her people were all delighted at the honourconferred upon their countryman.The Beginning of the Great Schism279Joanna with her usual royal generosity immedi-ately sent the new Pope a present of 40,000 crowns,a ship-load of provisions, and all kinds of thingswhich she thought would be useful to him, andat the same time she wrote to tell him that allher kingdom had to offer was at his disposal.Later,when the Cardinals rebelled against him, Joanna senthim 200 cavalry and a large body of foot-soldiers toguard him.We shall never know all Urban's reasons foracting as he now did ; for while he accepted Joanna'spresents and the service of her troops, he wasbrother-in-law, 1plottingthe Duke of Andria, who was in rebellion againstdownfallwithherherher.Joanna had now four great enemies to contendwith : her life-long enemy, Louis of Hungary, wasstill upon the warpath ; the Duke of Andria wasagainst her ; her nephew and heir,in rebellionCharles of Durazzo, was in the service of theKing of Hungary, and plotting to dethrone her ;and, as she was soon to discover, the new Popewas the most powerful of all her foes.The shadows were darkening round her.Theaccession of Urban VI. was the first step in thebeautiful Sicilian Queen. Haddownfall of theshe opposed Prignano's election from the first,it1 Her sister-in-law, Margaret of Taranto, was married to the Dukeof Andria.280The Beautiful Queenwould have been easy to understand Urban's conducttowards her ; but, as we have just seen, she didnot do so—on the contrary she treated him withgenerous loyalty until the crash came.Urban's enemiesattributedhis behaviourtoJoanna to his nepotism, a grave fault in a Pope,of which he cannot be excused ; for it is said hedesired the greater part of Joanna's kingdom forhis nephew, Francisco or Butillo Prignano, a mostunworthy man of licentious life, and Urban deter-mined to invest Charles Durazzo with Joanna'scrown on condition that he would give up halfthe kingdom to his nephew, Francisco Prignano.While the Pope and the Duke of Andria weresending secret messengers to Durazzo, to try tonegotiate this business, CardinalOrsini went tothe Neapolitan Court, and in an interview with theQueen tried to induce her to refuse to acknowledgeUrban, and to get the Ultramontane Cardinals toelect him as Pope in his stead.Joanna, with her usual wisdom, refused to doanything of the kind ; and so far from favouringCardinalOrsini'sproposal, shesenta splendidembassy—with her husband, Prince Otho of Bruns-wick, at its head, accompanied by her Chancellor,Nicholas Spinelli—to Rome to endeavour to smoothmatters there, and to make peace between the Popeand the now offended Cardinals, and if possibleto ward off the threatened schism.The Beginning of the Great Schism281This act of Joanna's should not be forgotten,as it too often is by her detractors, who, becauseshe afterwards was unhappily led to espouse thecause of the antipope, Clement VII., and to playa prominent part in the Great Schism, heap allmanner of abuse upon her, remembering all herbad acts and forgetting all her good ones, forgettingalsothe very great provocation she received torevolt from Urban, although nothing could excuseher from doing so.His election, though disputed,was legal, and it was the duty of all good Catholics,of whom Joanna was one, to be loyal to him inspite of his faults, which were great.To begin with, Urban had a violent temper, andhis exaltation he became so haughty, andaftertreated the Cardinals who had elected him with suchscorn and contempt, and instituted such vigorousif necessary reforms, that they revolted against him,and thirteen out of the fifteen who had voted forhim were so disgusted at the treatment they receivedat his hands that they withdrew from Rome andwent to Anagni first, and afterwards, at the requestof Onerato Cajetano, Lord of Fondi, to Fondi, wherethey ultimately elected the antipope Robert, Bishopof Geneva, who took the title of Clement VII.Onerato Cajetano was a most powerful Neapolitanbaron, and had lent the late Pope 20,000 florins,and when Urban came to the throne he wrote andasked him to discharge his predecessor's debt. Urban282The Beautiful Queenwas furious, and deprived Cajetano of his title andfief, and gave them to Sanseverini, Prince Otho'sChancellor.Cajetano's.- daughter was engaged to bemarried to Otho's brother, Balthazar of Brunswick.Unfortunately Joanna'sto Rome wasFirst and foremost it was to try to makepeace between the Pope and Cardinals ; but secondlytwofold.missionit was to ask Urban's consent to the marriage ofMaria, daughter and heiress of Frederick the Simpleof Sicily, to Prince Otho's nephew, the Marquis ofMontferrat.Urban, however, desired to unite the rich Sicilianheiress with his own nephew, Francis Prignano, andhe was so angry at the proposal made to him onMontferrat' s behalf that he could not command histemper sufficiently to answer the ambassadors civilly.Nicholas Spinelli, Joanna's Chancellor, and Urbanhad been intimate friends before Joanna's favour hadraised them both to the high position they after-wards occupied in her kingdom ; but now Urbanwould not listen to his old friend, who was almostas anxious to serve him as he was to please Joanna ;and when the Chancellor tried to point out thatthe marriage he had come to propose would bemost advantageous to the Papacy, since it wouldunite both the Sicilies in its interests, the Pope flewinto a violent passion, and said he " would soonsend the Queen of Naples to spin in the monasteryof St. Clare."The Beginning of the Great Schism283From this time matters between the Neapolitanembassy and the Pope went from bad to worse.Prince Otho and the Chancellor, Nicholas Spinelli,were naturally highly indignant atJoanna, and Urban continued to add fuel to theinsult tothisflame he had kindled by a succession of slightswhich he put upon Joanna's husband and minister.One day, at a public banquet in Rome, Spinelliseated himself next to Otho (which indeed was hisproperplace as Chancellorof the kingdom herepresented), whereupon the Pope ordered him toget up instantly, and not presume to occupy a placewhich did not belong to him, but to go lower down.The Neapolitan pride of Spinelli could little brookthis insult, and it is said that he never forgave it.Urban,notcontentwithinsultingJoanna'sChancellor and his own old friend, treatedtheQueen's husband alsowith markedNeapolitancontempt, and also with great ingratitude, for Othohis power to support the Popehad done allinand uphold his authority.On one occasion when the Prince of Brunswick,according to custom, held a basin of water and atowel for the Holy Father to wash his hands beforedinner, Urban turned away and, pretending not tosee the Prince kneeling at his side, entered intoconversation with some one else,till one of hisfriends, horrified at this behaviour to one of suchhigh rank as Prince Otho, the Consort of the Queen284The Beautiful Queenof Naples, exclaimed : " Your Holiness must needswash ; Holy Father, it is high time you did so."Otho's secretary says that Otho then repeatedthe remark made of an earlier Pope Urban, thathe feared the Holy Father should rather be calleda disturber than urbane, making a Latin pun lostin translation. 1It does not require much imagination to pictureJoanna's just anger when Otho and her Chancellorreturned to Naples and related this incident andvarious other insults which they had received atthe hands of the Pope, whom she had originallybeen so anxious to help, and had treated with suchgenerosity.Petty annoyances and slights of thiskind are apt to stir up and engender more strifeTheand bitterness than more aggressive actions.scenes between Urban and Joanna's embassy tookplace at Tivoli, whither Urban had retired whenthe other Cardinals went to Anagni, from whencethey issued encyclical letters to, all the Europeancourts, declaring the election of Urban null andvoid.As a cbunterblast to this, Urban proceeded tocreate twenty-nine new Cardinals, and at the sametime he offered to have his election examined by aGeneral Council of the Church, which he proposedto call ; but the Cardinals refused to consent to this,1 " Pro certo pater noster non Urbanus sed potius, timeo Turbanusdicetur."The Beginning of the Great Schism285and the election in September of the Bishop ofGeneva by the Cardinals at Fondi, which was in thekingdom of Naples, was the beginning of the GreatSchism, which disturbed the Church and the wholeof Europe for forty years, from 1378 to 141 8.Robert of Geneva, the antipope, was a most blood-thirsty man ; he had personally led into Italy theBreton Company, the most inhuman of allthemarauding bands of adventurers which molested Italy,and he had instigated them to commit atrocities.They were commanded now by Francesco de Vico,Prefect of Viterbo.Robert of Geneva, after his election by the FrenchCardinals, was crowned in the Castle of Fondi, inthe presence of Prince Otho and other NeapolitanOf the four Italian Cardinals who hadvoted for Urban, only two remained faithful, thenobles.old Cardinal Piero of St. Peter's died, and CardinalOrsini now joined Joanna and recognised ClementVII. as Pope. When Urban returned to Rome fromTivoli he found himself deserted by the SacredCollege ; and it was by the advice of St. Catherineof Siena that he created the new Cardinals.Sheadmonished him never to resign his high office, andby her admirable counsels encouraged him to perse-vere in his difficult career.Very soon all Christendom was divided betweenthe rival Popes, some countries remaining true toUrban, others joining the Clementines. The Emperor286The Beautiful Queenof Germany, the Kings of England,Sweden,Denmark, Hungary, Bohemia, and most of theItalian States and Flanders were loyal to Urban ;whereas France and Scotland (which at that timeinvariably sided with France against England), Spain,Naples, Austria, Cyprus, Savoy, and some of theItalian and German States joined Clement's party.The Papal war now began in earnest. Rival armies,each bearing the banner and Keys of St. Peter, meton the plains of the Romagna, and at first theadvantage was on theside of the Clementines.Meanwhile Urban and Clement fulminated ana-themas against each other, and each excommuni-cated the adherents of the rival Pope, so that allEurope was disturbed and unsettled by the quarrelsof the Urbanists and the Clementines.St. Catherine of Siena now proposed to Urbanthat she should go to Naples with St. Catherine ofSweden, St. Bridget's daughter (who was in Rome,working for her mother's canonisation, which wasdelayed by the schism), and endeavour to win Joannaover to his cause. But there were two obstacles tothis plan. In the first place, Catherine of Sweden, whowe know did not like Joanna, positively refused togo and see her; and in the second place the confessorof St. Catherine of Siena, Raymond ofCapua, dissuadedher from going, and Urban reluctantly yielded tohis representations, for which the saint was veryindignant.From a woodcut in " Revelatwnes Sanclat Birgilta;, 1500."ST. BRIDGET DELIVERING HER RULE TO THE MONKS AND NUNS.p. 286]The Beginning of the Great Schism287St. Catherine of Siena, who had a high respect forthe Neapolitan Queen, now wrote letters to Joannaand to some of the ladies in her court, and sent themto Naples by her devoted friend, Neri di Landuccio,entreating the Queen to be loyal to the lawful Pope.But by this time Joanna was unfortunately tooclosely involved in the fortunes of the antipope todraw back ; moreover, she knew Urban was deter-mined to depose her in favour of Charles Durazzo,to whom he had again offered the crown of Naples,through Joanna's enemy, the Duke of Andria, whomhe sent to Charles to persuade him to accept it.Charles, who was not so black as he has been painted,seems to have had scruples at first at treating hisfoster-mother in so ungrateful a way, but Andriaovercame them by rousing his jealousy againstPrince Otho and Robert, Count of Artois, who hadmarried the Queen's eldest niece, Joanna, Duchessof Durazzo, daughter of Maria of Sicily, and theDuke suggested that Joanna intended to leave hercrown to either one or the other of them.Joanna,however, had made different plans, and had decidedto adopt Louis of Anjou as her heir.Charles of Durazzo hesitated to obey the Pope'sinjunctions for another reason : his wife Margaret,the Queen's adopted daughter, and his two childrenlived in the palace with Joanna, and until they wereremoved he could not with due regard for theirsafety take active measures to obtain the throne.288The Beautiful QueenMeanwhile Urban VI. created several NeapolitanCardinals, and bestowed benefices upon some memberof all the most important families of the kingdom,by which stroke of diplomacy he won over to hiscause many of the most influential subjects of Joanna,who was now unfortunately irrevocably pledged tothe antipope.The battle of Marino between the two rival Papalarmies proved victorious for Urban, thanks to theservices of Sir John Hawkwood and his mercenaries,whom he had hired to fight for him ; and Clement,feeling no longer safe at Fondi, determined to retireto Naples, and begged Joanna to send an escort toconvey him thither.Joanna, knowing that many of her subjects wereloyal to Urban, was afraid that the antipope mightmeet with a hostile reception if he went to CastelNuovo, where her court usually resided when shewas in Naples ; so she had the island Castel del Ovofitted up magnificently for his reception, and wentto the expense of having a temporary bridge thrownacross from the rock on which the grim old castlestood to the mainland.Clement and the Cardinals of his creation passedover this bridge in procession, making a granddisplay, and when they reached the great gatewayof the castle met with a magnificentreception.There were assembled the brilliant Neapolitan courtof barons and knights and other nobles, with their—The Beginning of the Great Schism289wives and daughters in attendance on the royalprinces and princesses, all attiredcourtfullindress.Under the great gateway, thecentre of thisbrilliant throng of "fair women and brave men,"and the fairest among them all, stood Joanna, inthe royal purple velvet robes always worn by theNeapolitan sovereign, with magnificent jewels uponbeauty, although no longer young.her head and neck and arms ; a vision of majesticBy her sidestood Prince Otho, a handsome and imposing figure,and close by the three daughters of Joanna's deadsister Maria : Joanna, Duchess of Durazzo, wife ofRobert of Artois ; Agnes, widow of the Prince ofVerona ; and Margaret, wife of Charles Durazzo,the Queen's adopted daughter.As Clement dismounted Joanna genuflected twice,and then knelt to kiss his foot and receive his bless-ing, and the royal princes and princesses did thesame, and when this ceremony was over the anti-pope went into the castle to partake of a magnificentfeast prepared for him and his Cardinals.The festivities and entertainments which Joanna'ssuperfluous generosity had prepared to welcome thedisturber of the peace of Christendom lasted severaldays, and caused supreme discontent and disaffectionin Naples, because, from the remoteness of the scene,the citizens were unable to see anything of themand pageants are very dear to the Neapolitan heart.l 9290The Beautiful QueenJoanna's usual wisdom had deserted her, in thefirst place, when, goaded by Urban's discourtesy andplots against her, she had chosen to support Clement,and, in the second place, when through fear lest theantipope should meet with any hostile demonstrationshe had installed him in the Castel del Ovo, and byso doing had disappointed her people of the festivitiesFrom a reli-and pageants in which they revelled.gious and from a political point of view, the usuallywise Joanna committed a fatal mistake, one of theremoter consequences of which has been the obloquywhich has ever since attached to her name, preju-dicing as it has done so many loyal Catholic writersagainst her, so that they were unable to judge herfairly.Nothing can excuse her conduct altogether inthis matter, but at least nearly half Europe sinnedwith her, and no one had greater reason or strongertemptation to join Clement's party than she had.The Neapolitan people, who were too ignorant toenter into the merits and demerits of the contro-versy, and dared not rebel against Urban, interpretedJoanna's action in hiding the antipope in the Casteldel Ovo as a sign of temerity on her part, and werein a state of ferment, when they were roused toopen rebellion by an incident which occurred soonafter Clement arrived.A working-man in the Piazza of Sadlers oneday spoke disrespectfully of the Queen to a groupThe Beginning of the Great Schism291reprove him.of listeners in the hearing of a gentleman namedRavignano, who was riding past, and who stopped toThe man repeated his remarks, andhis insolence provoked the rider to ride his horseat him with the intention of knocking him down ;but in the scuffle which ensued the sadler lost hiseye.His nephew raised the cry of Urban VI.,and the infuriated crowd flew to arms and pro-ceeded to pillage the houses of foreigners in thelower part of the city.The Abbot Barruto, whom Urban had recentlycreated Archbishop of Naples, headed this mob,and then took possession of the cathedral, drivingthe family of the Clementine Archbishop out ofthe archiepiscopal palace.This tumult was soonquelled, and reprisals followed, in the course ofwhich thehousesoccupied by the ArchbishopBarruto and his suite were pulled down.These disturbances caused Clement to be seizedin which he left Castel delwith a fit of panic,Ovo and fled to Gaeta, and refused all Joanna'sinvitations and entreatiesNaples.From Gaeta he went to Avignon, which becamethe place of residence of the antipopes and theirreturntotocourt.
