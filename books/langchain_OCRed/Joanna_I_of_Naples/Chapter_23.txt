CHAPTER XXIIIThe Final TragedyT^OR two months Joanna dragged on a miserableAexistence in her gloomy prison, cut off from allher friends and from holding any communicationwith them, deprived of all the state and splendourto which her high rank had accustomed- her, andequally deprived of the occupations the duties ofher regal office afforded, and of the amusementsfor which her brilliantcourt had so long beenfamous.Added to all these negative trials was the positiveone of anxiety as to the fate of her husband, Otho ofBrunswick, to whom she was deeply attached.had now little to offer her,captivity was intended by her captor to be life-she knew herLifeforlong.Her time was largely spent in the chapel, prayingShe had always been famous forbefore the altar.herlove of devotional exercises and herstrict327328The Beautiful Queenobservance of ecclesiastical feasts and ceremonies,but now she gave herself up almost entirely toprayer.Meanwhile the finalcatastrophe was hastenedto its ghastly consummation by the appearance ofpart of Louis of Anjou's fleet in the Bay of Naples.This arrived in the middle of May from Provence,where Louis had collected an army of 35,000knights to drive out the usurper and seize uponthe throne.Urban VI. had by this time decided to deposeCharles Durazzo, who had offendedhim, anddaily the Neapolitan nobility were forsaking himfor Joanna, to whom in her distress they nowturned, and the universal desire among her sub-jects for her restoration became more and moreevident.The last straw which decided Charles to takeher life was an embassy from her old enemy, Louisof Hungary, Charles's uncle, to congratulate himupon his success, and to demand the death of theQueen.Louis asked this as the price of his supportof Charles's cause and as a reward for his pasthelp.Historians differ very much as to the detailsof Joanna's assassination, some even going as faras to excuse Charles from conniving at it ; but therecan be no doubt that he sent the four Hungariansoldiers who actually accomplished the foul deedThe Final Tragedy329to Muro for the purpose of murdering his aunt andfoster-mother, from whom he had received so manyfavours and benefits. He dared not trust its per-formance to any Neapolitan—he could not easilyhave found one so base as to attempt it—and so hechose four of his rude Hungarian soldiers, whosebarbarous crime was a mosthatred of Joanna and of all Neapolitans was intense,and to whom thecongenial task, while their master, Louis of Hungary,who had always obstinately believedhad been an accomplice in the murder of his brother,Andrew of Hungary, looked upon it as a tardy actthat Joannaof just retribution." Let Joanna die the same death which Andrewsuffered through her," he wrote to Charles.Some accounts of the manner of Joanna's murdersay that she was smothered in bed with pillows,others—and these are the most frequent—that she wasThe version we are about to give, whichstrangled.seems the most reliable, is taken from the worksof Urban's secretary, Theodoric de Niem, who wasat Naples during the time her remains were exposedto public view, and no doubt had ample opportunitiesfor learning the truth.It seems that on the morning of May 22nd, thecaptive Queen, who was now treated like a commonprisoner, went to the chapel for her devotions, aswas her habit at this time, when the four Hungariansoldiers secretly entered, and while two guarded the:33°The Beautiful Queendoor the other two crept up to the kneeling Queen,and throwing a silken cord round her neck, strangledher instantly.The only redeeming feature in this ghastly, cruelmurder is that it was done quickly before the poor,helpless Queen had time to realise their intention;possibly before she even saw her murderers they haddone their work.Probably Joanna had during these seven or eightweeks at Muro prepared herself for death ;prayers had doubtless obtained her the pardon sheherpasttransgressions, and atsought for herthemoment of death she was in the act of prayer.There can be little doubt she was well prepared tomeet that great and most just Judge who aloneknows the secrets of all hearts.When the news of her death was brought toCharles, he ordered that her body should be takento the Church of St. Clare in Naples, and placedin the choir there and exposed to the view of allher people, that they might see her for themselvesthat she was truly dead, and by that sad sight beconvinced that any further efforts to restore her toher throne were in vain.At the expiration of the eight days during whichshe lay in state, she was interred in this same churchbetween the sacristy and the tomb of her late father,the Duke of Calabria.is sculptured aRound itLatin inscription to this effectFrom an engraving by J .

May XXVII. 1She was in the fifty-sixth year of her age, and thethirty-ninth of her reign, when she was thus done todeath by her implacable enemy, Louis of Hungary,and her ungrateful adopted son, Charles III., whosename was execrated all over Europe as a matricidewhen the news of Joanna's murder transpired.Thesad spectacle of her dead body in the Church ofSt. Clare had quite the contrary effect to that whichCharles had hoped and intended to create. Eventhose who had before been indifferent to her fatewere moved to compassion for her sufferings by thesight of her corpse, and so indignant at Charles'scruelty and ingratitude that they refused to submitany longer to . his rule ; while those who had everbeen faithful to Joanna were now so exasperatedagainst Charles that they swore vengeance againsthim, and joined the forces of Louis of Anjou.Thus perished Joanna of Naples, one of the mostbeautiful and most maligned of women, whosepraises, as we have seen, have been sung by the most1 Inclyta Parthenones, jacet hie Regina JoannaPrima, prius felix, mox miseranda nimis :Quam Carlo genitam mulctavit Carolus alter,Qua morte ilia virum sustulit ante suum.MCCCLXXXII.

Weshall merely content ourselves with saying brieflywhat became of the principal persons who havefiguredin thishistoricaltragedy, of which thecentral figure was the great 'Sicilian Queen.Her husband, Otho of Brunswick, was liberatedThe Final Tragedy;333by Charles two years after her death, and in rewardfor some advice whichhe had given Durazzo,CharlesTaranto.conferred upon him theprincipality ofSome years later, when Louis II. of Anjougrew up, Otho, with the aid of the Sanseverini,succeeded in placing him upon the Neapolitan throneand when Louis refused to live in Naples, the Princeof Brunswick was offered the title and office ofViceroy, but he yielded it to Sanseverini. He diedin Foggia in 1398, having survived Joanna fifteenyears.Joanna's lifelong enemy, Louis, King of Hungary,survived her only four months ; he was surnamedthe Great, and was deeply mourned by the Hun-garians, who lost in him a good, brave, and wiseking, as celebrated for his victories in the field ofbattle as for his private virtues, which togetherearned him this title.In his dealings with Joannahe allowed his natural affections for his brotherAndrew to overpower his sense of justice.In the year following the assassination of Joanna,Louis of Anjou, having in vain endeavoured toprovoke Charles Durazzo to an engagement outsidethe walls of Barletto, withdrew with his army toBari, where a fever of a pestilential character brokeout in his camp, to which he succumbed on Septem-ber the 2 1 st, in his forty-seventh year. He left twosons, the elder of whom, Louis II., succeeded him,and for a short time occupied the Neapolitan throne.334The Beautiful QueenCharles Durazzo was lying dangerously ill of feverat the time of Louis's death, but he recovered, andas soon as he had settled affairs in Naples, whichLouis's death facilitated, he went to Hungary inanswer to an invitation from some of the HungariansHere, after much plottingto assume the crown.and scheming on his side and counterplotting on thepart of the Dowager Queen Elizabeth and Maria,who had been proclaimed " King " of Hungary onthe death of her father, whose only child she was, hewas foully murdered on February 7th, 1386.A soldier in the pay of the Dowager QueenElizabeth struck him with a sword as he was inthe act of reading a letter, half severing his headfrom his body. He lingered in great pain for twodays, and was finally smothered, as he showed signsof recovering.Thus retributive justice was dealt to the murdererof Joanna in the prime of his life, for he was justforty-one when the avenging angel overtook him.As his quarrel with Pope Urban VI. had led to hisexcommunication, he was denied Christian burial.Charles III. was a little man, with fair hair and aruddy and smiling countenance ; he was affable andvery popular ; he was very generous to his partisans,and a great patron of men of letters. He had manygood qualities ; he was a very brave and mostaccomplished soldier.But his cruel ingratitude tohis foster-mother, against whom, no doubt, his uncle,The Final Tragedy335Louis of Hungary, greatly prejudiced him, hasmade a blot on his fair name which can never beeradicated.And here we take leave of this great but unhappyQueen, who has so often and so aptly been calledthe Neapolitan Mary Queen of Scots, whom sheresembled so much in some respects, notably inher beauty and her misfortunes and in the mysterywhich surrounds the assassination of Andrew ofHungary and of Darnley. A parallel might alsobe drawn between the conduct of Charles Durazzoand the Earl of Murray.Both these unhappy Queens will ever have theiradmirers and theirand their charm aroused envy among their con-temporaries as well as admiration, and brought themtheir beautydetractors,forboth cruel enemies as well as enthusiastic friends.May we venture to hope that our readers, as faras Joanna of Sicily is concerned, will rank amongthe latter ?CHARLES I.
