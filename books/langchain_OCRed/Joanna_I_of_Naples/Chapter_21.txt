CHAPTER XXIJoanna is BesiegedTHE Castel Nuovo, in which the Queen usuallyresided when in her metropolis, had beennewly fortified and strengthened in the case ofeventualities, and here Joanna and her ladies-in-waiting retired when the siege of the city began,with sufficient provisions laid in to last them sevenmonths.With Joanna were her two nieces—her eldest niece,also named Joanna, who by virtue of her primogeni-ture enjoyed the title of Duchess of Durazzo, whichshe inherited from her mother, and her sister Agnes,the widow of Can della Scala, Prince of Verona. TheDuchess of Durazzo was very rich, partly by inherit-ing a handsome patrimony, partly through the wealthshe had accumulated by her parsimony and miserlyhabits.Before the siege began the Queen had asked theDuchess to lend her some of her money, to coverpart of the expenses of the war, and to provide for3°3304The Beautiful Queentheir defence, her own exchequer being low, and sheconsequently in great need of money ; but theyounger Joanna refused, although her own safetywas at stake: her love of money was so great, thatshe preferred to face the danger which threatenedher rather than part with it.When the news of Charles's entrance into Napleswas brought to the Queen she was besieged at thesame time with appeals for help and protection from anumber of noble ladies and their children, who, withmany of the Clementine clergy and some of theworthiest of the old barons of her kingdom, imploredher to admit them inside the castle with her and hersuite.Joanna knew that if she granted this appeal herprovisions would only last one month instead ofseven, but she also knew that if she refused therequest of these helpless women and children andold barons, and sent them away, she would be sendingthem not only to death, but to endure horrors farworse than death, at the hands of Charles's barbarianHungarians and lawless adventurers, and from theferocity of the mob and the infuriated populace.She could not steel her heart to abandon thesedelicate women and helpless children to save herown life, so, with her characteristic but in this casefatal generosity, she admitted them all to share herlast refuge.We are not told what the other less generous;Joanna is Besieged3°5Joanna, the Duchess of Durazzo, said to this actionbut, judging from her character, she was, we shouldsay, unlikely to approve it, and may have remon-strated with her royal aunt.But if so she wasoverruled, and all the petitioners were admittedto the castle.Joanna's one great and only hope now was in thearrival of her Provencal fleet before her supplieswere exhausted, and at the beginning of the siegethis hope was very strong and well-founded.Sheexpected it every day to arrive and bear her away toAvignon and the protection of the antipope, Clement,until her newly adopted heir, Louis of Anjou, shouldcome with his army from France and expel Charlesof Durazzo.But day after day passed and no fleet arrived, dayafter day the besieged inhabitants of the castle scannedthe horizon from its towers in the hope of detectingthe sails of the belated galleys, on which all theirhopes were based, but all in vain : the days length-ened into weeks and no sign of them rewarded theanxious watchers.And daily the rations grew smaller and smaller,and the Queen and her nieces, the court and thegarrison, and all the women and children, priests andbarons she had admitted to share her fortune werebeginning to feel the pangs of hunger.Presentlythey were reduced to feed on carrion, and were inconsequence assailed with sickness, and still no sign20306The Beautiful Queenof the Provencal fleet gladdened their aching eyes,and anxiety gave place to despair among the weaker-hearted ; but Joanna was courageous as ever, andendured all these privations bravely.Then one day her niece, Joanna, Duchess ofDurazzo, when they were reduced to extreme hunger,put all her gold and jewels into a large vase, andcarried it into the Queen's presence and laid it ather feet.Joanna looked mournfully at the treasure,which, had it been offered to her when she askedfor the loan of it in her necessity, might have savedall their lives, but was useless now, since there wasno possibility of exchanging it for food of any kind,of wheat would be more preciousand putting the useless offering aside, said sadly :" A sackme now, my niece, than allLetthat thief Charles, whom you have served so well,have it."this treasure.toMeanwhile Prince Otho, who was at his wits' endto know what to do for the best to help his besiegedQueen, endeavoured to entice Charles Durazzo outof Naples, to which end he returned to the walls,and destroyed the aqueduct which supplied the citywith water, in the hope that Durazzo would beforced, through want of the first necessity of life, tocome out and give him battle.Durazzo, however,More-Was too wise to do anything of the kind.over, the Neapolitans who had joined him showedhim many springs of fresh water which were in theJoanna is Besieged3°7city, and from them he learnt that most of thehouses were empty, the inhabitants having madegood their escape by flight.They further counselledhim not to be so rash as to make a sortie, and per-haps lose all he had already gained in one day, whenit was certain that the Queen and her garrison couldnot hold out much longer, and must soon be forcedby the pangs of hunger to surrender.Charles took this advice and remained in the city,but he was not idle. He knew Castel Nuovo was fartoo strong for him to take it by storm, so he didnot wastethe strength of hissoldiers by anyvain attempts, but contented himself with address-ing the people and exhorting them to submit tohim and acknowledge him, whom they had knownso long as the heir to the throne, as Joanna's suc-cessor ; and little by little the Neapolitans, or thegreater number of them, joined his party.The fact that Charles was supported by the truePope, Urban, and that the Queen had been excom-municated by him and had joined the cause of theantipope, Clement, had much to do with this defec-tion of her subjects.Prince Otho, finding that his attempt to drawCharles had failed, and that he was for the presentpowerless to help Joanna, retired with his forces toAversa.Joanna, who was now on the verge of starvation,still hoped against hope for the arrival of the long-—308The Beautiful Queenlooked-for galleys, which failed to come and rescueher; and seeing that her ladies and the womenand children, and the garrison, were suffering all thehorrors of a siege when the provisions are all butShe couldexhausted, began to think of surrender.not see all these her dependents perish, even if shewere willing to die of starvation herself ; so she de-cided to send her pronotary, Ugo de Sanseverinoto Charles to try to come to some terms or arrangea truce.This she did ; and Durazzo, who was nearly relatedto Sanseverino, and knew him to be one of the mostpowerful barons in the kingdom, received him well.But the utmost concession he would grant the Queenwas five more days, at the close of which, if she werenot relieved, she was to surrender ; but he promisedthat in this case she should not be removed from CastelNuovo, but should be served there by her usual suite.Durazzo's game now was to get Joanna to surrenderwillingly, and to acknowledge him once more as herheir ; and with this object in view he sent a deputa-tion of nobles to her to reassure her of his filialaffection and submissive reverence for her. And toemphasise these assurances—in which he could hardlyexpect his adopted mother to place much faith, see-ing he had so long been plotting to seize her thronehe sent her every day fruit and poultry for her table,and gave orders that she was to be supplied abun-dantly with all she required for her own use.Joanna is Besieged3°9If thebesieged inhabitants of the castle hadships fromwatched anxiouslyMarseilles before, they now spent every hour of thefive days of truce in looking anxiously from everythe expectedforavailable window and tower for some sign of theirapproach—but in vain.Joanna, whose faith had always been very strong,was now a very devout woman, and spent much ofher time in prayer before the altar in her privatechapel in the castle.But neither did prayer seem toavail her, as far as the hoped-for fleet was concerned,for it did not make its appearance, and when thefifth day of the truce dawned there was still no signof it.During the truce Joanna had managed to send toAversa to conjure her husband to make one moreeffort to rescue her; and on this fifth day Otho ledhis forces through the road of Piedigrotta, past theisland of Ischia, till he reached the barriers Durazzohad erected before the Castel Nuovo, and tried tothrow provisions into the castle.This led to a pitched battle between him andCharles's soldiers, both sidesfighting with suchdesperate valour that for a long time the result wasThe combatants were so close tovery doubtful.the castle that the Queen was able to watch thePerhaps Otho may havefight from the windows.caught sight of her majestic figure—at any rate,her proximity and the knowledge of her captivity3 roThe Beautiful Queenand sufferings so maddened him that he made adesperate attempt to seize the standard of Charles,which was surrounded by the bravest and mostaccomplished knights, who had fought with Durazzoin the wars of Hungary and Venice.Otho's men, many of whom were recently re-cruited, were unable to cope with these well-seasonedsoldiers, and he soon found himself alone in thebut he still fought bravely on.thickest of the fight, where he received severalwounds ;Thethought of his beautiful Queen and the threatenedloss of her throne stimulated him, who was knownas one of the bravest soldiers of his time ;

but the horses they had leftbehind were seized by the Neapolitan people, whospent hours in catching them.The battle was now completely lost.Otho'sprincipal captains, Baldassero of Brunswick, Robertof Artois, the Count of Ariano, and Zurlo succeededin escaping, but a good many of the nobles who hadrelations inside the city joined them, on receivingassurances of safety, and went over to the enemy'sside, as Joanna's cause was now considered hopeless.This contest, so disastrous to Joanna, took placeon August 25th ; and on the next morning she senther surrender to Charles, as there was still no signof the ships from Marseilles, and the time of thetruce had expired.When Charles reached the castle on the morningof the 26th he found the Queen, who—torn withanxiety for her wounded husband, now a prisonerin her enemy's hands—had passed a terrible night,walking in the garden, wishing perhaps to enjoy alittle fresh air before she herself was made a prisoner.Her majestic dignity was not without its effecton her ungrateful conqueror ; and partly from longhabit, pardy perhaps from a sense of shame, he fellon his knees at the feet of his adopted mother, as;3 12The Beautiful Queenthough she were still his sovereign instead of hisJoanna looked sadly down on her formerprisoner.heir, whom it is said she now hated, and said :" Charles, I will not enumerate all the benefitsI have bestowed upon you, for it would ill becomeHeaven anda captive to humiliate her conqueror.earth behold us and will judge between us.Re-member only my regal dignity, if anything sacredin your memory, and treatcan still find a placemy husband with the respect due to a prince ofhis rank."Charles rose from his knees, and made ferventprotestations of reverence and love for Joanna,assuring her that he would never have attemptedto snatch her kingdom from her if he had notbeen persuaded that Otho intended to dispute itwith him in case of her death.Joanna, who was the same age as Otho, and ofa very good constitution, knew what valuetoattach to this false excuse for conduct which wasShe commanded her anger, and, withinexcusable.her usual royal dignity, eloquently begged him totreat Prince Otho honourably, as befitted his rankand implored him to have mercy on all the captivesin the castle, and especially on the Clementineclergy, who feared the punishment their schismaticalconduct would draw on them from Urban, whoseviolent temper was well known, and who could notbe expected to show them much mercy.From an early woodcut portrait, by kind permission of Mr. St. Clair Baddeley.CHARLES THE THIRD OF NAPLES.p. 312]Joanna is Besieged313Charles, though now he had acquired the kingdomof Naples by force, was not content with this, butwanted also the rich inheritance of Provence, and,knowing that more was to be obtained of Joannaby kindness and consideration than by threats orattempts at frightening her into submission, trustedthat he might still be able to delude her into makinghim once more her heir.With this object in view he gave orders that,although his prisoner, she was to be treated withregal honours, and approached with all the customaryforms, and attended by her usual officers and ladies-in-waiting.On the fourth day after her surrender the long-looked-for Provencal fleet appeared, too late to beof any use, only adding, as it must have done,anguish of the unhappyfresh bitterness to theQueen when she saw its masts on the horizon.Itwas composed of twelve armed galleys, commandedby Angeluccio di Rosarno and Ludovico Antonio,Count of Caserta.Charles, as soonas he wasnotified of their arrival, went up to the castle tohave another interview with Joanna, and endeavour,by fawning upon her, to persuade her to makehim her heir.He addressed Joanna as his Queen and belovedmother, renewed all his professions of loyalty, andsaying she must now be convinced of his sincerity,he humbly begged her to nominate him heir of all3HThe Beautiful Queenher dominions in Provence, and to put all theforeign troops, which had at last so tardily arrived,under his command.Joanna, who had no longer the least faith in theprofessions of Charles, and knew that the resultof any document she might sign would be to leadher either to the scaffold or to lifelong captivity,to grant this request.could not be induced by promises or persuasionsShe knew too that her onlyhope—and that a very faint one—was in Louis ofAnjou, whom she had already nominated her heir,and to offend him by making Charles her successorwould be to cut off her only hope of release fromcaptivity and restoration to her throne.She inwardly resolved that she would be faithfulto Louis of Anjou, and not risk alienating himfor ever from her cause, but, pretending to believeCharles, she said to him :" Give my captains a safe pass, that they may landand come to me and take my orders."Charles, deceived by her composure, and thinkingthat he had at last prevailed upon her to acknow-ledge him again as her heir, acceded to her request,and granted a safe-conduct to the Count of Casertaand the chosen deputies from the Provencal galleys,and consented that they should have an audienceof Joanna in his absence.:
