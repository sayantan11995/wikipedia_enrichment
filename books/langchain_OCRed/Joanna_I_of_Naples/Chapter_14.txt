To begin withthere were Giovanni and Nicholas of Pisa, Brunel-leschi, and the two Masuccios, the second of whomdesigned the monastery belfry at St. Clare.Giotto di Bondone, who painted the frescoes in theChurch of St. Clare—begun, as we have just said, bythe late King Robert—died when Joanna was abouteleven years old, but his glorious art had been epoch-making, and there were many of his disciples whomshe could employ to beautify the churches she built.A rather amusing story is told of Giotto, who, as allthe world knows, was taken by Cimabue from tend-ing his father's sheep into his own house, and trainedby him because he in passing had seen the boy'stalent displayed in drawings of his sheep with apiece of chalk.Giotto is said to have been remarkably ugly, andvery small, and on one occasion he was riding nearFlorence with a friend, who was equally ugly, and ascelebrated as a doctor-of-law as Giotto was as anartist, when they were overtaken by a thunderstormand were obliged to take shelter in a peasant'scottage ; and as they were wet to the skin, they hadto borrow clothing of their host.Giotto looked sosublimely ridiculous in his borrowed garments, whichwere much too big for his little body, that his friendburst out laughing and said, " Who to see you,Giotto, would ever think you were the greatest208The Beautiful Queenpainter in the world ? "" And who to see you,could ever think you knew your alphabet ? " repliedthe artist.Giotto's frescoes in the Church of St. Clare atNaples were destroyed later by a Spanish viceroy,who had them whitewashed to make the churchlighter—the "dim religiouslight" and Giotto'sdelightful art not appealing to this Philistine.Giotto was succeeded by Simon Martini, who ismentioned by Boccaccio; but though Giotto's influencewas undoubtedly felt at Naples, there has never beena great Neapolitan school of art, either in paintingThe two Masuccios are usuallyor architecture.regarded as the founders of Neapolitan sculpture,but little that is reliable is known of them.It was during this second widowhood that Joannashowed her capabilities as a ruler. Her characterhad now developed, and she began with bothprudence and vigour to try to restore tranquillityto her kingdom, which was torn asunder by so manyShe endeavoured to suppressbroils and dissensions.the brigands who were such a pest, and to bringto justice the malefactors who infested the country ;and she succeeded in accomplishing this great andglorious task, which would have taxed the powers other illustrious predecessor— the wise King Robert.She showed great clemency and even munificenceto those who had rebelled against her, or who hadbeen partisans of her enemies, and forgave injuriesJoanna's Second Widowhood209freely ; so that Caracciola says that no prince beforeher had ever actedso generously and benignlytowards the Neapolitans, that she forgot injuriesand remembered benefits, and most richly rewardedall those who followed her adverse fortunes. Hesays that " if there exist other rulers whohave enriched individuals more richly, there arenone who equalled her in the multiplicity of heralsobenefits."" Never," says this same writer, " shall we seethis city more populous than under this same Queen ;of mercantile ships morenever was the arrivalfrequent than under her government and protection.This was all due to the love she had for her people,and the care she lavished upon them. The peopleincreased so fast that they almost turned the churchesinto houses for them to live in.Everywhere therewas abundance of food and plenty of commerce, andthe nation enjoyed great ease and security."This was perhaps the most prosperous part ofJoanna's reign, but the period of peace did not lastHer calumniators attributed every misfortune,including the death of Louis, to the vengeance oflong.the murder of herHeaven forAndrew ; and fearing that as a widow she might onaccount of her great beauty be exposed to slanderfirst husband,and evil report, at the conclusion of the term of hermourning for Louis, she was advised by her friendsMore-to marry again in order to have a protector.210The Beautiful Queenover, the nation earnestly desired that she shouldhave a son to inherit her crown, otherwise it wasto be feared that civil war would break out againamong the turbulent Neapolitan princes.Soon after the death of Louis of Taranto thePope Innocent VI. died—indeed, one of his lastpublic acts was to celebrate Mass for the repose ofthe soul of the late King of Naples.In the conclavewhich followed his death the Cardinals were almostas puzzled whom to choose for his successor as theyhad been when his predecessor died.Their firstchoice fell upon Cardinal Hugh Roger, the brotherof Clement VI., but he refused to accept the honour.The result of the next ballot, which is piouslybelieved to have been the work of the Holy Spirit,was the election of the Abb6 William de Grimoard,a most holy man, then Abbot of the Monastery ofSt. Victor, Marseilles, who was celebrated for hisgreat wisdom and virtue.Although a Frenchman, he sympathised with theclaims of Rome as the seat of the Papacy, andconsidered Avignon as a temporary place of residenceonly, and desired to move the Chair of Peter backAt the time of his electionto the Eternal City.de Grimoard was at Naples, where he had beensent by the Avignon Court, ostensibly to conveymessages of condolence on the death of Louis toJoanna, but in reality to watch her conduct andto report upon it.For five months he resided at—Joanna's Second Widowhood211the Neapolitan Court as the Abbot of St. Victor,and during that time formed so high an opinionof the Queen that he became one of her greatfriends, and after he was raised to the Papal thronehe treated her with even greater respect and honourthat Clement VI. had done, and, as will appear,bestowed honours upon her such as have never beforeor since been conferred upon a woman.Joanna's appearance when the future Pope wasresiding at her court must have been very striking.Her majestic figure was robed in pure white, andthe absence of all ornaments and artificial aids toto her classic features.beauty must have given a kind of angelic severityHer devotion and charitymade a great impression upon the holy Abbot, andThe factcompletely won his esteem and affection.that when he was called to the highest dignity uponearth he found himself in a very difficult positionas he soon saw many reforms were necessary—mustbetween him and thehavewidowed Queen, who was beset with difficulties onanotherbeenlinkall sides.One of Joanna's first actions when she took upthe reins of government after Louis's death was tosend her trusty servant Acciajuoli to Messina toconclude the war there by making a truce withFrederick, after which he was counselled to returnto Naples with as many troops as he could musterto oppose Louis's eldestbrother, the Prince of212The Beautiful QueenTaranto, who was intriguing to obtain her throneHe hoped that he could persuadefor himself.Joanna to allow him to administer her governmentfor her ; but she was much too wise to do this,foreseeing clearly enough that if she did so shewould be a Queen in name only, while her ambi-tious brother-in-law would be to all intents andpurposes the ruling monarch ; so she promptly deter-mined to nip this project in the bud.She called together a council of all her wisestmen, and absolutely refused to allow the Prince ofTaranto to have anything whatever to do with thegovernment of her kingdom, and the Prince, find-ing his efforts were useless, retired in high dudgeonto his own estates.cumstances made it imperative that Joanna shouldThis and other similar cir-marry a third time, and there was no lack of suitors.The King of France was very anxious that sheshould choose his son Philip, the Duke of Tours,for whom such a marriage would have been mostadvantageous ; but he was tenor twelveyearsyounger than Joanna, and she very wisely consideredthat a barrier which could not have been got overhad there been no other objections to such a match.John, the French King, endeavoured to get thenew Pope Urban V. to support this proposal; butJoanna, dreading the difficulties and quarrelsinwhich the inexperience and youth of the boyishDuke of Tours and the haughtiness of his courtiersJoanna's Second Widowhood213would probably involve her, most wisely declinedthe offer.One of the handsomest princes atthis timeabout theNeapolitan Court was James III. ofMajorca, a king without a kingdom.Majorca, thelargest of the Balearic Isles, had been taken fromthe Saracens about the year 1230 by James I., Kingof Aragon, and by him erected into a kingdom ;Isles, together with the twotheBalearicothercounties of Roussillon and Moritpellier being de-pendent upon it.1295James II.of Aragon inanAngevine princess, the daughter of Charles II. ofAnjou, by whom he had two sons, Pedro andThe elder succeeded him as King ofAragon under the title of Pedro III., and themarriedJames.younger as King of Aragon under the title ofJames I. of Majorca ; they were always at war witheach other, and left the quarrel as an inheritanceto their sons, Pedro IV. of Aragon and James II.of Majorca.In 1349 Pedro IV., surnamed the Ceremonious,succeeded in despoiling his brother of the kingdomof Majorca, in a battle in which James II., as someassert, was killed, and his son James III. was takenprisoner. He was in captivity for many years, butat last succeeded in effecting his escape, and wentto Naples, where he was one of the most attractiveIt was upon him thatmembers of that gay court.——214The Beautiful Queenthe choice of Joanna and her council fell as the mostsuitable candidate for her hand.The conditions imposed upon the nominal Kingof Majorca were that he should possess of Joanna'sdominions the Dukedom of Calabria only, and thathe was not to expect to have any share in the govern-ment, nor to assume the title of King, but to waitthe Queen's pleasure to bestow either of theseprivileges upon him, in case their marriage shouldbe blessed with children or even one child to in-The fact that Montpellier andherit the throne.Roussillon were adjacentpossessions made James more acceptableJoanna'stoProvencaltotheQueen's advisers, as they were valuable adjunctsto her French dominions.James raised no objections to the conditionsindeed, notwithstanding them, Joanna was the mostbrilliant match he could have found in all Europeand the marriage was duly celebratedthe pomp and magnificence which had graced theQueen's former weddings.with allSome writers say that James's father was notslain on the battlefield, but was kept a prisonerby Pedro, and that three months after his marriagefather had been treacherouslyJames heardmurdered in prison, and that he at once left Napleshisfor Spain with all the troops he could muster toavenge his father's death.However this may be, whether the King wasJoanna's Second Widowhood215slain in battle or in prison, it is certain that JamesIII.set out very shortly after his marriage withJoanna to try to recover his kingdom.Joannawas not able to render him much assistance in thisexpedition, for she was obliged to send a force todefend her Provencal dominions from the inroadsof the Dukes of Milan and Savoy, who were inTheprompt measures which Joanna took, and the fidelitydeprive her of them.together toleagueof her Provencal subjects, soon succeeded in de-feating the two Dukes, but her husband was lesssuccessfulinhis campaign against the King ofAragon.After three months' wedded happiness Joannawas, to all intents and purposes, again a widow,at least a grass widow, for her husband was absentalmost the whole of their married life, and frequentlyshe did not know whether he was alive or dead.The means of communication were slow and by nomeans sure, and the life of James was fraughtwith so many adventures on the battlefield andin captivity that it was exceedingly difficult for theQueen toobtain reliable information ashistomovements.There is a long account of James III. and hisexploits in Froissart's Chronicles, but his accountof Joanna has been proved to be so inaccurate thatit will not do to place too much reliance uponhis tales of the adventures of her third husband.216The Beautiful QueenOf certain facts, however, there seems to be littledoubt—at any rate, most historians repeat them astrue.He appears to have fought for three or fouryears against the King of Aragon quite unsuccess-fully, and then to have fled to Bordeaux, wherethe Prince of Wales was then residing, and toAccording to Froissart, this washave joined him.1367, and he saysinwith the Black Prince in Bordeaux the Princessa son, who afterwardsof Wales gave birthwhile James wasthattosucceeded to the English throne as Richard II.The little Prince was baptized in the church ofSt. Andrew, in Bordeaux, and the King of MajorcaFroissart says thewas one of his god-fathers.Prince of Wales received James well and treatedhim handsomely, " for he was a stranger, and farfrom his own country, and his finances were low."Edward then joined Peter the Cruel, King of Castile,in an expedition in Spain, and he promised to restoreJames to his kingdom if he would accompany himon this campaign, which turned out to be a brilliantIn this splendid expedition, in which thesuccess.Black Prince won such great honour, James ofMajorca fought side by side with him.At the end of the campaign the Prince of Walesit, thewent to Valladolid, or, as Froissart callsVale of Olives, translating the Spanish word ; andthere the heat was so great that they were all moreJoanna's Second Widowhood217or less affected by it, and James was so ill thatwhen the Prince of Wales moved on he was con-Thefined to his bed, and had to be left behind.Black Prince sent some of his English knights tothe King of Majorca to tell him his troops weresuffering so much from the heat that he was obligedto leave Spain, and to ask if he wished to go withthem.James replied that he was so ill that he couldnot lift his foot to the stirrup ; and on being askedif he would like some men-at-arms left behind asa guard, he declined, saying it was uncertain howlong he might be forced to remain there.Peterthe Cruel turned out a perfidious ally, failing tokeep all his engagements, and proving himself amost ungrateful friend ; for as soon as the Englisharmy had left all the towns they had reconquered,he went back to his brother, Henry of Transtamare,who marched to Valladolid, where he heard theKing of Majorca, his bitter enemy, was lying con-fined to his bed, to take advantage of his weaknessand make him a prisoner.James at once askedwhether Henry would make him his own prisoneror whether he intended to send him to the Kingof Aragon, as he would rather die than fall intohis hands.Henry replied that on no account would he actso disloyally as to send him to his greatest enemy,but would retain him as his own prisoner until82iThe Beautiful Queen—he was either ransomed or it pleased him to setJames now found means of com-him at liberty.municating his plight to Joanna, who, as soon asshe heard of it, set about raising the money forhis ransom and finding trusty messengers to nego-tiate the business.She succeeded in procuring hisransom at an immense cost, which, Froissart says,was paid so graciously that the King of Castilethanked her for it.Directly he was released from his captivity Jamesreturned to Naples, but he was so bent on revengeagainst the King of Aragon that he only remainedwith Joanna long enough to collect men and armsand money sufficient to carry out another campaign,which he set out upon much against Joanna's wishif we are to credit Froissart, who says Joanna wishedand counselled her husband to join his forces withher cousin, the King of France, instead of with theEnglish under the Prince of Wales. He resistedall her arguments and entreaties to remain with herin Naples and abandon the hope of recovering hisown very small kingdom ; but James was obstinate,and would not be persuaded, so the Queen yieldedto his wishes, and gave orders that as he passedthrough Provence the highest honours should bepaid him, and a sum of 10,000 golden florins givenhim for his expenses, which, seeing that he wasvery handsomewishes, seemsdisregardinghertreatment.Joanna's Second Widowhood219Before we recordthe end of his somewhatmythical, or at least very uncertain, fortunes, wemust make mention of a characteristically mediaevalincident which occurred to Joanna about this time.At a large and, as it was called, " solemn ball,"which Joanna held at Gaeta, at which she was theadmired of all eyes, there was present Galeazzoof Mantua, one of the most accomplished Italianprinces of the time, and Joanna chose him as herpartner in one of the dances.Joanna was a beautiful dancer, and Galeazzo alsoexcelled in this art ; and at the conclusion of thedance he knelt before the majestic Joanna, whowas now about forty and a magnificent creature,and thanked her humbly for the honour she hadso graciously bestowed upon him in allowing himto be her partner, and then and there he made asolemn vow that he would not rest until he hadfound and challenged and defeated two valiantknights, to give to her as a present.Joanna replied, "that in good time, and by thegrace of God, he should accomplish his vow, sincesuch was his pleasure and the custom of knighthood."Galeazzo then travelled half over Europe, goingto France, Spain, Germany, Hungary, and othercountries where the flower of knighthood was tobe met—we do not hear that he went to Eng-land—and having found two knights worthy ofhis prowess, he challenged, fought, and defeated220The Beautiful Queenthem, and brought them captive to Naples at theend of the year following the solemn ball at Gaeta.Arrived at Naples he sought an audience, andgenuflecting before the Queen, he presented theJoanna thanked himtwo captive knights to her.cordially, congratulating him upon having accom-plished his vow so gallantly, and then thus ad-dressed the knights :"Sirs, you are, as you see, my prisoners.Bythe laws of chivalry, I may cause such as are inyour captive condition to serve me in any ignobleoffice I may best please ; but I think you will judgeby my countenance that cruelty does not dwell inmy heart, to dispose of the unfortunate in such amanner. Of my clemency then, and humanity, Igive you from this hour entire liberty and franchiseto act as you please, whether to return free to yourown country, or, before you depart, to solace your-selves in my kingdom, and view the curiosities ofit, which are sufficiently admirable.After havingvisited them return to me, and when you choose todepart I shall be well pleased to commend you to God."We of the twentieth century, whose ideas are sodifferent, can hardly imagine such a scene as thisever taking place ; but in mediaeval days redeemedslaves and prisoners and the vanquished became somuch the property of their purchasers and con-querors that they were frequently disposed of bywill. A few years later Joanna redeemed a TartarJoanna's Second Widowhood221princess from slavery, and sent her as a present toher friend,St. Bridget of Sweden, the widowedPrincess of Nericia, who was then dying in Rome.This extraordinary present arrived just after thedeath of the saint had taken place ; but the captivewas adopted by Bridget's daughter, St. Catherine,who took her to Sweden, where she became a nun inthe convent of Wadstena, in the Order founded bySt. Bridget, and died herself in the odour of sanctity.Many of these captives and conquered knightswere less fortunate, and did not meet with suchclemency as Joanna showed her two prisoners.Brantdme records the fate of a vanquished knight,whom his conqueror bestowed upon the canons ofSt. Peter's Church in Rome, with his arms, hishorse, his armour and trappings ; and says thatthey kept the unfortunate man a prisoner in thechurch for the remainder of his life, which he spentin walking to and fro, his recreation being to standat the open door, whose threshold he never passed,The laws of chivalryand watch the traffic outside.were so binding on the honour of all knights thatthis one could not break his parole, but was obligedto submit to his sad fate.Prisoners of war were treated more or less asthe personal property of their conquerors, even inChristian Europe, until the institution of standingarmies, when they passed under the care of theState to which they belonged.
