He was proposedJoanna Marries a Second Time113to the Council as a suitable husband for the Queenby his eldest brother, Robert of Taranto, who hadlately married a daughter of the Duke of Bourbon.The other councillors, feeling the necessity of con-ciliating the princes of Taranto, lest if this offerweretheir youngerbrother Philip and the Duke of Durazzo, immedi-They were hamperedately agreed to the proposal.in their choice, which was confined to the Neapolitanprinces, for it would not have done at this junctureto propose a foreign prince ; neither the royal familyshould joinrejectedtheynor the great barons would have agreed to that.most interested in the marriage.There was no difficulty with either of the partiesLouis was knownto be madly in love with his beautiful cousin andQueen, and Joanna is believed to have favouredhis suit : she had known him from childhood, and hewas from all accounts a very attractive man.Never-arranged.theless it was some months before the marriage wasLouis, although a brave man in war, wasvery diffident in love, and finally it was his friend andtutor, Nicholas Acciajuoli, who did his wooing forhim and made all the preliminary arrangements.The Duke of Durazzo opposed the marriagevehemently, for it was a death-blow to his hopesof securing the throne for his wife, Maria, whichhe and the Durazzos were labouring to do bycalumniating Joanna, so asif possible to depriveher of the allegiance of her people.8ii4The Beautiful QueenThe marriage took place on August 20th, 1347(old style), two years after the murder of Andrew ;but in spite of this fact Joanna's detractors haveaccused her of marrying before the year of herwidowhood had expired, whereas two years allbut a month had elapsed since Andrew's death.According to many writers,was disapproved of by the other European courts,who had apparently heard the scandalous reportsof the intimacy between Joanna and Louis andthis second marriagewere only too ready to put the worst interpretationupon them. Of course it is quite possible that ifJoanna had been consulted about her first marriage,she might have preferred the handsome, talentedLouis of Taranto to the half-imbecile, boorishHungarian prince to whom from motives of policyBut eventhe late King Robert had wedded her.if this were so, it does not follow that there wasanything wrong in her relations with Louis, althoughvicious tongues asserted that there was.As Louis was her cousin, a Papal dispensationwas necessary to enable them to marry, and thereis a difference of opinion among historians as toarrived, manywhether Joanna waitedthistillasserting that she did not do so ; but Villani saysthat the Pope granted the dispensation, and at thesame time made Louis Regent of the kingdom,but that the marriage caused " scandal to all zealousChristians "—whose zeal, we venture ^o think, wouldJoanna Marries a Second Time115have been much better employed in saving theirown souls than incriticising Joanna's conduct,which in no way concerned them.While the preparations were going on for themarriage Louis of Hungary sent ambassadors tothe Papal court at Avignon, to demand the investi-ture of the kingdom of Naples for himself, thusexcluding not only the reigning Queen, but alsoher little son Canrobert, or Charobert, for the nameisspelt in both ways.Clement VI., however,refused to receive his ambassadors because he wasan ally of the excommunicated Emperor Louis ofBavaria, who had brought this punishment uponhimself, in the time of Pope Benedict XII., fordenying the Papal authority in Germany.The Pope sent a message to the King of Hungaryto say that nothing criminal had been proved againstJoanna, and that even had she forfeited her thronethe claims of Andrew's son could not be set aside.This was a great blow to Louis of Hungary, whohad believed that the Pope would favour his causeat the expense of Joanna.His next move made about the same time wasto lodge an accusation against Joanna and all theNeapolitan princes of the murder of his brotherAndrew, at the court of Rienzi, now Tribune ofRome. He had a twofold object in appealing toRienzi—first to enlist his sympathy and secure ifpossible his help, and secondly to justify himself for1 16The Beautiful Queenthe attack upon the Queen of Naples and her alliesby casting a public slur upon their characters.The royal family of Naples did not disdain to sendadvocates to Rome to plead their cause and clearthemselves from the odious stigma this accusationhad cast upon them, and Rienzi listened to them,seated upon his throne in great pomp ; but he putoff from day to day passing any judgment in theHis own downfall,matter, and left it undecided.precipitated by the Count of Minervino, who ac-companied the Hungarian ambassadors to Rome,followed soon after, and the great Tribune was senta prisoner to the Pope at Avignon, where he wascast into a dungeon.In the month of May preceding the marriage ofJoanna and Louis, Nicholas the Hungarian, the for-mer tutor of Andrew, had returned to Aquila, nearNaples, with large sums of money in his possession,side on his previouswith which he proceeded to bribe the Neapolitanswhom he had won to hisresidence in the kingdom, to forsake the cause oftheir lawful Queen and join that of the usurpingKing of Hungary, and unfortunately he succeededin corrupting many of Joanna's subjects. He wasjoined by a rebel baron who had previously estab-lished himself at Aquila.It was these traitors within the camp which madethe cause of Joanna and Louis of Taranto so des-perate : if all their subjects had been faithful,itJoanna Marries a Second Time117is believed that, notwithstanding the large armythe Hungarian King wasbringingagainsttheNeapolitans, they would have been able to repel theinvasion.The Duke of Durazzo joined the Queen's partyfor a short time, because he had discovered that hehimself was a greater object of vengeance to Louisof Hungary—who imputed Andrew's murder tohis hand—than even Joanna herself. He never-theless contrived to injure her cause by his malice,even when nominally fighting for her, and soon afterher marriage he raised the siege of Aquila andretired to his own dominions.The first division of the Hungarian army whichentered Naples in October was commanded by theBishop of the Five Churches, a natural brother ofthe Hungarian King : he is described by Villani asa wise and good soldier.It was the custom in theMiddle Ages for bishops to go to battle, and evenfor popes to do so : our English Pope Adrian IV.led his troops against his arch-enemy, FrederickBarbarossa, so there was nothing unusual in thisproceeding.Such was the disaffection in the country, and sogreat was the terror Louis's threats of vengeancehad kindled among the people, that many castlesand towns surrendered to the Hungarian troopswithout resistance, and some of the nobles wentOne of the causesover to the side of the enemy.1 18The Beautiful Queenlarity of the princes.of this treachery against Joanna was the unpopu-The people themselves wereofindifferent tothe rumours that the Queen was concerned inthe royal cause partly becausethe assassination of the late King, partly because ofthe ambition and haughty demeanour of the royalprinces.Louis of Taranto, inspite of all thesediscouragements, collected an army at Capua largeenough to stop the force of Louis of Hungarywhen he entered the kingdom in December.On reaching the frontier the King of Hungarywas met by the Papal legate, who commanded himto retire in the name of the Pope, to whom theFurthermore, thesuzerainty of Naples belonged.legate bade him cease from attempting any furthervengeance against the innocent Queen, saying thattwo persons alone had been guilty of the murder, andthose two had already been executed.It is mosttantalising that the legate should not have mentionedthe names of these two guilty people, and thushave solved the mystery of the murder of Andrew,which must remain now undisclosed until the dayof judgment.Louis had the insolence to reply to this remon-strance by saying that he had come to take possessionof a kingdom which by right belonged to himthrough his father Charles Martel (who, by the way,must not be confused with his illustrious namesake,the King of France who lived in the seventh century).Joanna Marries a Second Time119The haughty Louis went on to say that he shouldnothimself about his excommunication,troublewhich he considered undeserved ; and as for themurderers of hisbrother, a dozen rather thantwo had been guilty of that crime. Having thusdisrespectfully delivered his soul, his army continuedto march to Naples via. Benevento, an ancient citystanding upon a hill and surrounded by mediaevalwalls, with a celebrated gate upon the north side114, in memory of theerected in the year a.d.Roman Emperor Trajan, and called the GoldenGate.There were no standing armies in those days : thefight for their feudal lord, were the infantry.cavalry were the mounted nobles and knights, whosemen-at-arms, bound under the feudal system toThemounted soldiers wore plate-armour and chain-mail,but gunpowder was now coming into use, and with itthe wearing of armour decreased. We doubt verymuch whether the Hungarians and Neapolitans usedgunpowder in this war, though the English did atCrecy in the previous year for the first time. Morelikely the half-civilised Hungarians were armed withcross-bows, swords, pikes, javelins, battle-axes, andsabres, while the foot soldiers were furnished withany weapon which came handy—very often withtheir flails ; but in spite of the indifferent equipmenttheyfought with the greatest ferocity, and theHungarians were more noted than the more civilised120The Beautiful QueenNeapolitans for their fierce, barbarous methods ofwar.The Duke of Durazzo now basely betrayed JoannaThough he was still fightingto the Hungarians.nominally upon the Queen's side, he kept up asecret correspondence with the Hungarian camp,hoping ultimately to establish his wife, Maria, uponDurazzo knew that even if theHungarians should be victorious, which was stillher sister's throne.doubtful, the Neapolitans would never submit forSo he was playing a doublelong to their yoke.game ; and sad to say many of the Neapolitannobles followed his bad example, and courted thefavour of the Hungarian King.Louis, desiring to strike terror into the Neapolitanpeople, had had a banner made of black silk orvelvet, upon which was painted in most realisticstyle and colours a sensational picture of the assassina-tion of Andrew.This ghastly standard was borneby a band of mourners robed in black to heightenits effect.Finding herself deserted by so many of her sub-jects, and believing her cause to be hopeless, Joanna,disheartened by the vile reports current about her,determined to leave Naples and retire to Provence,where she as Countess of that country was idolisedand certain of a welcome.Accordingly she called ageneral council of all the principal and wisest menof her kingdom, and with that eloquence for whichJoanna Marries a Second Time121she was so famed made a speech in which shedeclared to them the resolution at which she hadShe began by telling her audience of thearrived.attheclosethreateneddanger whichcapital from theapproach of the King of Hungary, who was nowgates, and of her powerlessness toresist him because of the calumnies which hadbeen spread abroad by her enemies, who withoutany crime of hers had accused her of the mostitsatrocious iniquity, insensible of the pity which theytheir Queen, who in theshouldearliest bloom of youth had been the victim ofhavefeltformisfortune.She then went on to say that in order to makeknown her innocence to the Vicar of Christ on earth,as it was known to God in heaven, and to force thewhole world to acknowledge it also, she intended togo to Avignon and plead her cause before the HolyFather, whose absolution she would beg.She continued : " Only against me is the anger ofthe King of Hungary directed, me whom he holds asthe murderess of his brother Andrew.

But the majestic young Queento command her ownhad sufficientself-controlemotion, and sat there sad but dignified while bothburghers and warriors were weeping at her feetand the solemn silence with which they had at firstlistened was now broken by cheers and exclamations,imploring her to remain and dare every risk, thenobles vowing to lay down their lives for her andher children.The age in which Joanna lived was the age ofchivalry, so it is not surprising that this speech ofone of the most fascinating woman that the worldJoanna Marries a Second Time123has seen should have won the hearts of her hearers,for devotion to beauty at this time of day wasjcarriedto a degree of enthusiasm bordering on madness.It was not only the younger barons and knightsand citizens who were moved by Joanna's beautyand eloquence ; the old sage councillors were alsotouched. They not only applauded her resolutionand approved of her plans, but they too vowed notto rest until she was able to return, and they placedtheir lives and fortunes at her service.The journey from Naples to Avignon, in daysbefore the use of steam had been discovered, wasslow and by no means sure, for as the greater part ofthe way was a sea-voyage the travellers were at themercy of wind and waves.On January 15th, 1347 (old style), the Queen em-barked for Provence, taking with her her household,friends, among them Nicholasa few most faithfulAcciajuoli, and the Princess of Taranto, her sister-in-law, wife of Robert, Prince of Taranto, Louis'selder brother, and her celebrated diamonds and otherjewels.Three galleys were the means of transport.Agalley was usually a three-masted vessel with onedeck, supplied with oars, the number of which varied ;sixty-four, and probablyaJoanna's had not less. They were rowed generallyby criminals : hence the expression, " sent to thegalleys." When Joanna reached the sea it is saidVenetian galley had124The Beautiful Queenthat every man and woman in the city was atthe harbour, to catch a glimpse of the youngQueen. As many as could get near enough to doso kissed her hand before she embarked, and bothmen and women wept bitterly as she left the shore,and stood on the beach watching as long as therewas a sign of the disappearing galleys.The voyage, owing to the ignorance of nauticalscience of the times, was a dangerous one, and asit was performed in mid-winter the Mediterraneanwas quite capable of giving them a very rough time ;and as soon as the vessels were out of sight thecrowd besieged the churches, and, kneeling round thealtars, invoked every saint—especially Our Lady andSt. Januarius, the patron saint of Naples—to protecttheir beloved sovereign and grant her a safe voyageand a speedy return to her country.As Joanna sailed past the isolated rock in thebay, crowned with the gloomy Castel del Ovo, hermother's heart must have been pierced with griefand fear,for there she had left her little sonCharobert—now at the interesting age of two, justbeginning to prattle—with his guardians chosen bythe Pope, who had selected this casdc as the safestThe poor youngplace for the heir to the crown.mother was destined never to see her child again ;but she could not know this when she left him,although she must under the circumstances have feltvery anxious.Joanna Marries a Second Time125Her husband, Louis of Taranto, was with herfor three days, and on the 18th he landed on theItalian shore, which was neutral ground.The Princess of Taranto, whom her husband hadsent to her father, the Duke of Bourbon, as Napleswas in such a disturbed state, also landed here withNicholasAcciajuoli,who,benthimself on animportant mission to Florence, was to escort thePrincess thither ; and now Joanna was left almostalone to proceed to Nice, where she landed two dayslater, intending to travel the rest of the way toAvignon by land.But on reaching Achisi she metRaymond de Baux, Prince of Orange, who was hersecond cousin, the Count de Soult, and some otherProvencal barons, who were evidently on the look-out for her, having heard from the Hungarians thatshe was coming to Avignon. To her amazement,they seized her suite and sent them all back asprisoners to Nice, and led Joanna herself, with greatrespect and courtesy, but as a State prisoner, to Aix,the capital of Provence, where they lodged her inthe now deserted palace of her ancestors, the ancientcounts of Aix.Orange, we must explain, was a tiny principality,the chief town of which was about thirteen milesnorth of Avignon, and called Orange ;it was at thistime an independent State, and remained so untilThe Barons de Baux hadthe sixteenth century.been thereigning princes of Orange sincetheI2 6The Beautiful Queeneleventh century ; they were constantly lighting forthe titles of Count of Provence and King of Aries.The reason for this extraordinary reception ofJoanna from these Provencal barons, who were soloyal to the Angevine family, and supposed to idolisetheir beautiful Countess, the Queen of the TwoSicilies, was the reports spread by her enemy, theKing of Hungary, to the effect that she intendedto dispose of her Provencal dominions in order toobtainthe means tocarry on the war againstLouis of Hungary.For this purpose, the emissaries of Louis haddeclared, she was travelling to Avignon in order tomeet there her cousin John, Duke of Normandy,who in 1358 succeeded his father, Philip de Valois,as John I. of France, and sell her Provencal posses-The Provencals, who were a proudrace and, as we have said, devoted to the Angevinesions to him.line, were determined to stop this sale at all costs,and so seized Joanna and confined her as a stateprisoner at Aix, whither they conducted her withall courtesy and respect.She was treatedas a Queen in this gloomy,fortress-like castle, but she was not allowed to seeany one unless her attendants were present.Thiswas in order to prevent her from making anyattempt to negotiate the sale of Provence.In thisdesolate building, formerly the scene of revelry andmagnificence, whose now silent walls once rang withJoanna Marries a Second Time127the songs of the Troubadours, we must now leavethe unfortunate Queen while we relate what happenedin her absence from Naples.Little did Joanna think when she set out forProvence, where she as Countess was so revered andloved, that this would be the reception she wouldmeet with on stepping on to Provencal soil.;
