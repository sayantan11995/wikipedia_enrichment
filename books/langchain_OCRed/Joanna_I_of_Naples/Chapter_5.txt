CHAPTER VPlots and Counterplots'I "HE Durazzos, it will be remembered, were theyoungest branch of the Angevine family. KingRobert's youngest brother, the Duke of Durazzo,*had married Maria of Perigord, the sister of CardinalTalleyrand—a name that became celebrated throughthe distinguished diplomatist who lived four hundredyears later.The Duchess of Durazzo was a widow at thetime of King Robert's death.She was living inNaples with her three sons,Charles, Louis, andRobert, and her daughters, all of whom were well-known members of the Neapolitan Court.Charleswas a handsome man and a brave soldier, but un-scrupulous and ambitious, and report said was veryfond of his cousin Joanna, and certainly quite aliveto the advantages of a marriage with her sister,Maria of Sicily, whom King Robert had assigned byhis will to Louis of Hungary.As soon as Maria was of marriageable age, the66Plots and Counter-plots67Duchess of Durazzo set to work to win her affectionsfor her son Charles, just as the widowed Princess ofTaranto was endeavouring toestrange Joanna'saffections from her husband Andrew in favour ofher son Louis, but with this difference—that Mariawas only betrothed to Louis of Hungary, whileJoanna was actually the wife of Andrew.The Duchess persuaded her brother, CardinalTalleyrand, to induce Pope Clement VI. to grantMaria a dispensation to enable her to marry theDuke of Durazzo, who was her first cousin, onceClement, who was always only too readyremoved.to oblige his friends, consented without in this caseconsidering what the consequences would be of thismarriage of the heir-apparent to the NeapolitanHad he given it more thought, he wouldthrone.have seen that it not only threatened Joanna's in-terests, but might also prove dangerous to her crown.Maria was living at Castel Nuovo with the QueenRegnant, and the Dowager Queen Sancha, who hadnot yet entered the monastery of Poor Clares ; andthe Duchess visited her constantly, and, havingsucceeded in setting Maria against the Hungarians,was soon able to persuade her to give up Louis ofHungary, whom she had not seen, for the Dukeof Durazzo, whom she knew well.She then madeall the necessary arrangements for the marriage :she seems to have had a genius for intrigue, andto have planned everything very cleverly, for she68The Beautiful Queenmanaged to get Maria out of the palace andmarried to Charles before the child (for she wasonly fifteen) was missed.When it was discovered one fine day that theheir-apparent to the throne had been abducted andmarried to the Duke of Durazzo, thereby settingher grandfather's will at defiance, there was greatThe two Queens,Joanna and Sancha, were furiously angry, for Joanna,in the palace.consternationthough so young, was old enough and wise enoughto see what dangerous consequences might result toherself from it ; for Louis of Hungary was not likelyto submit quietly to being thus cheated of his bride,and would probably revenge himself by invadingJoanna's kingdom.Moreover, the fact that theDuke of Durazzo's grandmother was a princess ofHungary increased the danger to Joanna's throne,as the Hungarians were only too ready to disputeher right to it; and from their point of view, thisgave the Duke some claim to it himself, and waswhat he was aiming at secretly.It was immediately after this elopement that theQueen Sancha retired to her convent, leaving Joannaunder the care of Philippa the Catanese.the habit, and died before she had been more thanShe tooka year in the monastery, being probably too old tostand the austerity of the rule : she was thus happilyspared the knowledge of the terrible tragedy whichwas impending and its consequences.Plots and Counterplots69Angry as Joanna was with Maria and Durazzo,she soon forgave them both, and was reconciledto them, perhaps feeling the need of her sister'ssociety and sympathy in the midst of her owndifficulties and troubles, surrounded as she was byFriar Robert's boorish and ambitious Hungarians.Meanwhile the Princess of Taranto and Philippaseem to have been pursuing their infamous designof trying to undermine Joanna's loyalty to heryoung husband, trusting that as the Pope had beenso accommodating in Maria's case as to give her thenecessary dispensation to marry Durazzo, he wouldbe equally obliging in Joanna's, and pronounce herWhether Joanna was awaremarriage null and void.of these designs we cannot tell at this distance oftime and among so many conflicting reports.Shemust have known of the daily increasing unpopu-larity of the Hungarians, and probably shared inthe desire to get rid of the odious Friar Robert,but there is no evidence to show that she wishedto be separated from Andrew.In the course of 1344 Clement VI. appointedlegate, to govern theCardinal Americus ashiskingdom during Joanna's minority ; and on August28th the beautiful young Queen received the in-vestiture of the crown from his hands, and tookthe oaths according to the customary ceremonies, andon the same conditions as her predecessors, Andrewbeing only a spectator.It was the Cardinal's in-—;7°The Beautiful Queenfluence which achieved this stroke of policy, and heafterwards did his best to control the authority ofFriar Robert, but he did not succeed very well, forhe was a stranger in Naples, and therefore ignorantof the most important affairs of State, and all thosewho were opposed to his appointment withheld thenecessary information from him.Friar Robert was, as we have seen, popular amongthe lower orders, who believed in his reputed sanctity.Joanna, seeing everything going to ruin, now wroteto the Pope and begged him to allow her to governfor herself, without the interference of either legatesor guardians.for she was not yet seventeen—refused this requestClement, on account of her youthand she then wrote another letter to him, begginghim to recall Cardinal Americus, and appoint inhis place Philip de Cabassole, the Bishop of Cavaillon,whom King Robert had in his will placed at thehead of the Council of Regency with Queen Sancha,and with his last breath had committed the care of hiskingdom and the charge of his grandchildren to him.This good bishop, who was afterwards made aCardinal and Patriarch of Jerusalem, was also afriend of Petrarch, who says of him "that he wasa great man with a little bishopric," Cavaillon beingonly a small town near Avignon and also nearVaucluse, where Petrarch frequently retired whenhe wished to live in seclusion.Philip was of noblebirth, and had been made a canon at the age ofPlots and Counterplots71twelve, according to a mediaeval custom of conferringbefore they were old enough to be ordained.these nominal preferments upon boys and youths, longTheCabassoles had always been attached to the Angevinefamily, who, with their usual generosity to theirdependents and friends, had loaded them withThe Bishop had remained at Naples afterRobert's death, and had showed his anxiety to dobenefits.all he could for the late King's family.Clement VI. knew this, and, recognisingthereasonableness and wisdom of Joanna's request,gave his consent immediately, and the result wassome mitigation of the miseries of the people andof the indignities to which the royal family hadbeen subjected by the Hungarians.The tyranny and rapaciousness of these barbarians,whose object was to wrest the kingdom from Joannain favour of the Hungarian family, had so rousedthe great barons and the princes of Taranto andDurazzo that they now determined not to consentto the coronation of Andrew on any terms.of Hungary had already tried to obtain a Bull fromAvignon for his coronation in right of his grand-Louisfather, Charles Martel, but the Neapolitans hadrefused to take the oaths of allegiance to him,except as the consort of Joanna, and now theyrefused to acknowledge him as king, dreading, asthey had good cause to dread, the increase of anyHungarian influence.7 2The Beautiful QueenThe Duke of Durazzo, as the husband of Mariaof Sicily, was peculiarly interested in this question,and no sooner was he married to Maria than hebegan to intrigue not only against Andrew, butagainst Joanna also.Through his uncle, CardinalTalleyrand, he secretly represented to the Pope atAvignon the danger which would ensue for Naplesif Andrew were crowned, in which case the Nea-politans feared their kingdom would become merelya province of Hungary.Clement considered theirrepresentations, and delayed to grant the Bull forthe coronation for two years after Robert's death ;then the court of Hungary is said to have sentthe Pope's council a bribe of 100,000 florins, afterWhich Clement issued a Bull for the coronation ofAndrew and Joanna, but of Andrew only as theQueen's consort, without giving him any personalclaim to the crown. The date for the coronationwas fixed for September 20th, 1345.Before coming to the events that occurred on theeve of this long-delayed coronation, it will be as wellto take a glimpse at the condition of Europe at thistime, and then briefly to recapitulate the conflictinginterests in the Neapolitan court, so as to bringbefore our readers the principal dramatis personain what came perilously like an Adelphi drama.Pierre Roger, who took the title of Clement VI.when he ascended the Papal throne in the yearKing Robert died, 1342, was, as his name implies,Plots and Counterplots73a Frenchman, and the fourth of the Avignon Popes.He loved magnificence and pomp, and the notori-ously luxurious court of Avignon was never moreluxurious than under his rule. He was fond ofthe society of ladies, and allowed them to frequenthis court ; he became a great friend of Joanna's,as will appear. He had many great qualities. Hewas frank, noble, and generous to a fault, anddispensed his favours with both liberality and grace.the most, was a love of luxury.His failing, of which his detractors have madeOn the otherhand, his benevolence was equally great, and atthe time of the plague, when in 1348 it visitedAvignon, he not only gave most lavishly to thehospitals and sufferers, but enacted very wise lawsNaturally highly gifted, he spentfor its suppression.much of his time in study, and had such an excellentmemory that Petrarch says he never forgot anythingthat he read : indeed if he had wished to do so hecould not.He admired Petrarch, and offered him the postbut nothing could induceof apostolic secretary ;the poet to accept it—probably because he dis-approved of the luxury of the Avignon court andthe licentiousness of the city, for it was never ina worse state than during the reign of this gentleand refined pontiff.The struggle between the Empire and the Papacywas still going on when he came to the throne,74The Beautiful Queenthough Louis the Bavarian, who for the last thirtyyears had troubled the peace of the Popes, had nowIn 1344, however, he hadthe impudence to convoke a diet at Frankfort, whichpretended to submit.he induced to protest against, what they describedas, the ambition and violence of the Pope.Clement VI.thusprovokeddetermined onthe deposition of Louis in favour of Charles ofLuxembourg, who was elected in 1346, and ascendedthe throne the following year under the title ofThus ended the longCharles IV., when Louis died.contests between the Papacy and the Empire.Clement published two Bulls for the protectionof the Jews from the persecutions to which theyhad been subjected under his predecessors, and heextended the Jubilee, which then only occurred everyhundred years, to every fifty years.This wasa very popular action with the Romans, for theyear of the Jubilee brings an enormous numberof pilgrims and other visitors to Rome, and thecitizens made a good harvest out of it and also inthe sale of pious articles, rosaries, medals, and otherobjects of devotion.The year after Clement came to the throne, Colade Rienzi, the great Roman patriot, came to Avignonat the head of a deputation of the Romans to urgethe Pope to return to Rome ; but they were un-successful, as Clement refused to leave Avignonfor Rome, the scene of constant struggles betweenPlots and Counter*plots75the rival barons and the people. On Rienzi's returnto Rome he incited the citizens to rise against thenobles, his hatred of them having been excited bythe assassination of his younger brother some yearspreviously.Rienzi's romantic career is so well known thatwe need only refer to it here, remembering that hewas afterwards sent back to Avignon as prisonerand confined by Clement VI., and released by hissuccessor Innocent VI., who sent him back to RomeHis tragic fate was dueto crush the nobles again.to his haughtiness, which disgusted the people whohad formerly idolised him.War between England and France was still goingon when Clement came to the throne.Benedict XII.,who for the time being had settled the quarrelbetween the Papacy and Louis of Bavaria, had alsosucceeded in getting a truce proclaimed betweenEdward III. of England and Philip VI. of Valois,Edward was disputingbut it only lasted for a year.the throne of France with Philip on the groundthat being a nephew of the deceased King Charles IV.,through his mother Isabella, Charles's sister, he wastherefore a degree nearer to the throne than Philip,Thewho was only cousin-germanSalic law, however, which excluded women from thesuccession, prevailed in France, so there was no realCharles.toFriction betweenground for Edward's pretensions.the two monarchs had further arisen, first by Edward76The Beautiful Queenhaving received Robert of Artois, who had beenbanished from France, and then Philip had returnedthe compliment by receiving David Bruce, who hadbeen dethroned from Scodand by Edward Balliol,whom Edward III. supported.Louis of Bavaria sided with the English, andhad also declared war against Philip, while Edwardwas now expected to invade France.His firstattempt at invasion through Flanders had failed ;but all Europe was disturbed and suffering fromthis war between itsmonarchs,and Clement did his best to make peace, but onlymightiesttwosucceeded so far as to get another truce proclaimed,but it was not long observed.The robber bands of mercenaries which followedin the wake of both armies were a terror to allItaly, as well as to France, where they penetratedas far as Avignon, so that even a French Pope wasannoyed by the depredations of the French King'sforces.If the state of France and Italy was such as togive great anxiety to the Holy Father, when heturned his eyes to Spain things were not muchbetter there. A struggle was going on there whichall Europe was watching with interest, between theMoors who had overrun the country and theChristians.Besides this religious strife, civil warwas disturbing the Peninsula, between the noblesand priests on the one hand, and on the other thePlots and Counterplots77members and representatives of a confederacy oftowns which had joined together for mutual defenceand had developed into a sort of Cortes.It was really a struggle between the aristocracyand the democracy, and in 1350, when Pedro theCruel came to the throne, the struggle was furthercomplicated by England taking the side of Pedroand the people, and France that of the nobles underHenry of Trastevera, an illegitimate son of the lateKing Alphonso XL, and half-brdther of Pedro.In Italy, Florence was at the head of all the othercities in art and civilisation, but it was the sceneof constant combats between the Guelphs and theGhibellines. Naples, as we have said before, possessedthe most refined and cultivated court in Europe.Rome was a prey to broils and insurrections, torobbers and assassins, which while they renderedexpedient in some ways the exile of the Pope, were,at the same time increased by his absence.Venice was governed by a council of ten, with theDoge at their head, possessing terrible powers overthe rest of the State ; and here and in Siena and allthe Italian cities, which were all independent States,a constant struggle was going on, not only betweenrival nobles, but also between nobles and people,while the entire peninsula was to a large extent atthe mercy of all those marauding bands of mercenarieswhich infested it, such as the White Company.A celebrated contemporary of Joanna at Naples—78The Beautiful Queenwas Marina Faliero, a distinguished military hero,who, after being at war for years with the Hungarians,finally defeated them in 1346, and some years laterwas made Doge of Venice. He had a beautifulyoung wife, whose romantic story and the subsequenttragic ending of the Doge's life have been the subjectof Byron's drama " Marino Faliero," and of Swin-burne's tragedy.In Scandinavia, where the people were slowlyemerging from the dark night of paganism into theglorious light of Christianity, there had arisen acelebrated prophetess and politician, a Swedish prin-cess, afterwards a canonised saint of the ChurchSt. Bridget of Sweden, wife of Ulf, Prince of Nericia,who left her a widow in 1345.became a friend of Joanna, whose court she visitedShe afterwardsseveral times, once under very romantic circum-stances, as we shall presently see.St. Bridget playeda great part in trying to induce Clement VI. toleave Avignon and return to Rome, but she didnot succeed :it was left to the daughter of thedyer at Siena, St. Catherine, to accomplish finallythe work of bringing back the Popes to the EternalCity.But to return to Naples, where the beautifulheryoung Queen andboorish husband weresurrounded by conflicting influences. On the onehand were Friar Robert in his dirty, ragged habit,and his insolent and semi-barbarianHungarians,Plots and Counter'plots79hated by all the Neapolitans, with an old nurse ofAndrew's in the background ; on the other sidewere Philippa the Catanese, still a very handsomewoman, and her granddaughter Sancha,Charles,Duke of Durazzo, and his child-wife Maria, theQueen's sister, his mother, the Dowager Duchess ofTaranto, the widowed Empress of Constantinople,Catherine of Valois, widow of Philip, Prince ofTaranto, and her three sons, the Bishop of Cavaillon,the Queen's aunt, the Princess Maria of Sicily andher satellite and lover, Boccaccio, a frequent visitorat this brilliant court, and Nicholas Acciajuoli, thehandsome Florentine, afterwards promoted by theQueen to be Grand Seneschal of the kingdom, forwhom the Empress of Constantinople is said to havehad more than a Platonic friendship.Indeed, it washer indifferent reputation and her intimacy withNicholas which led to his being accused of being theactual murderer of Andrew.Two other conspicuous personages at the Nea-politan court at this time were Charles Artus, GrandChancellor of Naples, and a member of the Councilof Regency, appointed by the late King Robert andhis son, both of whom were also great friends ofthe Empress of Constantinople.
