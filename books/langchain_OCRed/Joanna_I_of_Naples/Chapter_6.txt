CHAPTER VIThe Murder of AndrewTT was the custom of the Angevine Kings andQueens of Naples to leave the city during thesummer, when the heat became intolerable, and takeup their abode in one of their delightful summerresidences, or more often in one of the monasterieswhich they had founded, in the neighbourhood ofNaples, where the beautiful gardens and spaciousapartments formed a pleasant retreat from the caresof State and the noise and sultriness of the city.In 1345 Joanna had special reasons for desiringto get away from Naples, for she was expecting tobecome a mother at the end of the year; and inthe month of August she and Andrew removedto the castle of Aversa, to enjoy the cool retreatof the gardens in the Celestine monastery close by,and to escape the preparations for their coronationin Naples next month.Aversa is situated about80The Murder of Andrew81twelve miles north of Naples, in the enchantingscenery of the district known as " the happy Cam-pania."In this fatal year, 1345, Aversa consistedof little more than its grand old castle, which be-longed to the Crown, and afine old Celestinemonastery with lovely grounds, the town not havingrecovered from its demolition by Charles of Anjou,who destroyed it to punish the inhabitants for havingsided with some barons who were averse to hispolicy.Hence its name, Aversa.The castle was surrounded then by olive-woods,and orange-gardens, and dark forests of cedars andother trees; and in this delightful retreat, relievedfrom the presence of the odious Friar Robert, whoremained behind to govern the kingdom, the youngQueen enjoyed her villeggiatura, looking forwardopenly to her approaching coronation, and secretlydreaming of the fulfilment of her hopes of maternityat the close of the year.But whileJoanna, in her youthful innocence,dreamt of the splendour and pomp of her coronation,in which she took a girlish and natural pride anddelight, and meditated upon the still more sacredand purer joys of motherhood, which the poorest ofher subjects were also privileged to enjoy, thesecoming events were casting a shadow over the pagesof history which time will never efface.These two circumstances, the coronation and thebirth of an heir to the throne, were the immediate682The Beautiful Queencauses of the murder of the young king ; for theNeapolitans feared that when once Andrew wascrowned, Friar Robert, who ruled him, would rulethem, and tyrannise more than ever over the king-dom ; and in the next place, they anticipated that thebirth of an heir to the throne would endear Andrewto the Queen, and give him fresh claims upon theaffection and loyalty of the people.So while the young sovereigns were enjoying thecombined pleasures of court and country life, ofmusic and dancing, of the tales of the poet andthe songs of the troubadour, of the outdoor sportsof falconry and tournaments, a vile plot was beinghatched among the courtiers for the assassination ofAndrew.Although Friar Robert was left in Naples, someof the Hungarian suite had accompanied Andrewto Aversa, and it is particularly noted that his oldnurse, Isolda, who was passionately attached to him,At this distance of timewas staying in the castle.it is impossible to fix the guilt of this odious murderof the young King upon anyone ; but it is possible,judging from the known character of some who wereaccused of it, and in the knowledge of subsequentevents, to acquit at least two of them of complicityin it.We may dismiss at once as altogether improbable,if not impossible, the theory that Joanna had anypart in it, and equally unlikely is it that a man of soThe Murder of Andrew83fine a nature as Nicholas Acciajuoli was the actualmurderer, as is stated by de Sade in his Life ofPetrarch ; and many other writers have copied him,without questioning what a little more knowledgeof the man would have shown was at least highlyimprobable.Acciajuoli's intimacy with the Empress of Con-stantinople seems to have been the cause of his beingaccused, for the probability seems to be in favour ofthe opinion that this princess, whose moral characterwould notbearinvestigation, was one of theprincipal conspirators against Andrew, her well-known desire being to see her son Louis in hisplace.Philippa the Catanese is believed by some writersto have known of and sympathised with the plot,her motive being to deliver Joanna, whom sheidolised, from her boorish husband, who appearsto have been totally blind to her charms.But firstand foremost of all the conspirators was undoubtedlythe ambitious and unscrupulous Charles, Duke ofDurazzo, who is frequently accused of being one ofthe actual assassins.For six weeks the young Queen and her husbandat Aversa, whose pro-led a happy and gay lifepinquity to Naples permitted the daily coming andgoing of all those courtiers who were not livingat the Castle.September 20th had been fixed as the date of the84The Beautiful Queencoronation of Joanna as Queen and of Andrew asKing-consort, and on the eve of that day a greatbanquet was given at the Castle to celebrate thegreat occasion fitly.The sovereigns appear to have retired early torest in view of the fatigue of the coronation on thefollowing day ; the Hungarian courtiers and atten-dants had as usual taken more than was good forthem, and were sunk in too deep a sleep to hear thesubsequent disturbance, but the conspirators Werewide awake, bent on executing their fell purpose.In the adjoining monastery the black-robed monkswho had risen at midnight for matins, had goneto bed again, and all there was quiet when in thedead of the night, between one and two o'clock, oneof the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber, Mabrice,sister of Andrew's chamberlain, Jacobo de Pace,entered the royal bed-chamber inhaste, and toldthe King that a courier from Friar Robert had justarrived with dispatches of great importance, anddesired to see him upon State business.The poor, unsuspecting young King rose at once,and dressing hurriedly left the sleeping Queen, toproceed to another apartment at the end of a longgallery where,- instead of the supposed courier beinginattendance, theconspirators were assembled.These are believed to have been Charles Artus andhis son, Jacobo de Pace, Michael de Mirazzano,Andrew's chamberlain, Philippa's son the Count ofThe Murder of Andrew85Evoli, and her son-in-law the Count de Trelice, andRaymond of Catania, the Grand Seneschal.Directly the King left the bed-chamber, some ofthe conspirators locked the door, either to preventthe Queen from coming out and raising an alarm,or to hinder Andrew from returning. When theunfortunate young man, who was not yet twenty,had reached the middle of the corridor, he wassurrounded and seized by some of the conspirators.To muffle his cries one thrust an iron gauntlet intohis mouth, another threw a rope round his neck tostrangle him, others knelt upon his chest; and. thenthey dragged him to the balcony and hanged himover it, while their accomplices in the garden belowseized his feet and strangled him by pulling them.Not content with thus brutally murdering him,according to some accounts,actuallytheydis-embowelled him, and were about to bury his remainsina ditch in the garden, intending to say thathe had leftItaly for Hungary, when they wereinterrupted.It appears that his faithful nurse, Isolda, slept ina room under the balcony, and was awakened by thesound of his falling body when they cut the cordsWhether she guessed whowhich held it suspended.the victim was, or whether she saw it was the King,we do not know, but she managed to run to themonastery close by and awaken the monks, whohastened to the garden, where their arrival dispersed—86The Beautiful Queenthe murderers, who were now about to bury thebody.The tears and lamentations of Isolda were probablythe most sincere that honoured the mangled corpseof the unfortunate victim of this foul murder, for,in spite of his unattractiveness, as to which all writersare agreed, his old nurse loved him passionatelyperhaps because of those very weaknesses— and herfaithful heart was torn with grief and horror at themarks of violence on his corpse as she prepared itfor burial.The monks carried the remains into the churchof the convent, and watched it and prayed for therepose of his soul, until three days later he wastaken to Naples to be buried.There are many versions of the account of thismurder, no two of which agree in detail with eachother ; but the above is taken from Costanzo, theSomemost reliable of the biographers of Joanna.later Italian writers have given their imaginationsplay and concocted scenes which probably neveroccurred.For instance one, Rastrelli, says that theHungarian Isolda, on entering the Queen's apart-ments in the morning according to her usual custom,found Joanna sitting up by the bedside, and whenshe asked where the King was the Queen, laughing,The nurse thenwent out, and, following a miraculous light, foundreplied that she did not know.Andrew's body lying on the ground below theThe IVIurcler of Andrew87Thinking that he was asleep, she returnedbalcony.to Joanna and said, " Your Majesty, the King sleepsin the garden"; to which the Queen answered, "Lethim sleep there."Isolda, still unsatisfied, went downagain to the garden, where her appearance put themurderers to flight and she discovered the truth.Those who, like Muratori, suspected Joanna ofcomplicity inrepresent theHungarian nurse as rushing into the Queen's room,this atrocious crimeafter she had discovered the murder, and informingJoanna of it, and state that when others, drawn byher cries to the room, confirmed the report, " theQueen was so conscience-stricken, and so great washer confusion, that she could not even rise fromthe spot, but lay there until the morning was faradvanced, and knew not how to raise her tearlesseyes, or to look up at any one."Thus doesthemalignantspirit of calumnyinterpret the poor young Queen's most naturalbehaviour upon hearing of such a terrible catastropheHer tearlessnesswas no proof of guilt ;

on the contrary,her conduct was exactly what might have beenexpected from any young wife on such an occasion.She says of herself,in a most touching letterwhich she wrote to Andrew's brother the King ofHungary : " Stunned by grief I had well-nigh diedof the same wounds "; and there is not the slightestreason for doubting that this was the very truth.Another historian says of her : " The Queen, whowas only eighteen years old, trembled so that shedid not know what to do with herself."Later in the morning Joanna rose, and in a terriblestate of agitation and fear left Aversa, and returnedto Naples ; and calling all her best friends aroundher, askedtheir advice in the horrible calamitywhich had befallen the royal house.The first thing to be done was to send lettersto inform the Pope and the King of Hungary, andmessengers were at once dispatched with the ghastlynews to Rome and Hungary,the above-mentioned letter from the young widowed Queento Louis of Hungary, Joanna implored the King'sprotection for herself and her unborn child. HowLouis responded to this appeal will presently appear.InThe Murder of Andrew89Another ridiculous charge brought against Joannais that she left the body of Andrew unburied forthree days, and that then it was brought to Naplesand buried by the canons of the cathedral at theirown expense.The facts were that the body wasleft in the charge of the Celestine monks in theirchurch at Aversa until the necessary arrangementscould be made in Naples for the funeral ; and thesefor a king could not be completed sooner, for thefuneral rites and ceremonies due to Andrew's rankwere elaborate, and if he had been hurriedly buriedthescandalmongers wouldhaveseeninthisprecipitation fresh proof of guilt and a desire ofconcealment.At the end of the three days the body was broughtto Naples, and laid in the chapel of St. Louis in thecathedral with many tears and lamentations.said that the Neapolitans showed the greatest horrorIt isof the crime, and Andrew's undeserved sufferingsmoved the hardest hearts to sympathy ; this circum-stance is recorded unanimously by all historians.Indeed, the murder of Andrew sent a thrill of horrorall over Europe ; there was not a court that was nothorrified and scandalised by it.The reproach brought against Joanna that sheallowed the canons of the cathedral to pay for theit was their duty to performfuneral is absurd :the ceremony, for the Neapolitan sovereigns werealways buried in the cathedral, and it was probably90The Beautiful Queenthe custom for these canons tp bear some of theexpenses, just as the canons of St. Peter's at Romehad to pay for the greater part of the Popes' funeralexpenses.The faultsof Andrew haveprobably beenexaggerated by his contemporaries, for it was thepolicy of Joanna's friends and enemies alike topaint him as black as possible : her friends did soto excuse her if she were guilty of connivance in hisassassination, her enemies to find a motive for thepersonal repulsion they supposed her to feel tosuch an extent as to make her an accomplice inhis murder.He is described as a ferocious boor, a glutton,a drunkard, and a semi-idiot, with low propensitiesand gross habits. On the other hand, Petrarch, whoknew him personally, writing when the shock ofhis murder was fresh in his mind, to his friendBarbatus of Sulmone, calls him " the most gentleand inoffensive of men, a youth of a rare disposition,a prince of great hopes." The poet also says thathe foresaw that some dreadful calamities threatenedthis unhappy kingdom, but that he did not imaginethat a young and innocent prince would be the firstvictim sacrificed to barbarity.Petrarch's praise must be discounted by, the factthat Andrew's release of the Pipini had won hisregard and gratitude, and also by the considerationthat the poet's eloquence often led him to exaggerate.The Murder of Andrew91The just measure of Andrew's character is perhapssomewhere between Petrarch's praise and the blameof Italian historians.Possibly Andrew, had he lived, might have de-veloped later in such a way as to justify the hopesof which Petrarch speaks ; but his culpable indolenceand consequent gross ignorance made him a meretool in the hands of Friar Robert and his tutor,Nicholas of Hungary, whose ambition and tyranny,by rousing the hatred of the Neapolitans againstthe Hungarians, had contributed to the deplorablecalamity.Another cause of the assassination was undoubtedlyconnected with the Pipini. When King Robert hadimprisoned these counts, he enriched certain of theNeapolitan nobles with their spoils : when Andrewreleased them from their captivity, and took theminto such great favour, these nobles feared theywould fall into the hands of the Pipini, and bedeprived by them of their fortunes and probablyof their lives also.Among them were the son and sons-in-law ofPhilippa the Catanese, and they were peculiarlyobnoxious to Robert, and the probability is thatthey, being greatly interestedAndrew, were among the conspirators.has been universally condemned as being implicatedin the guilt of the Count of Evoli, her son, andgetting rid ofPhilippainher sons-in-law, but in her favour it must be said92The Beautiful Queenthat neither she nor her grand-daughter Sanchawas in the gallery or near the royal bed-chamberat the time of the murder.The Duke of Durazzo may or may not havedevised the plot against Andrew ; but if we givehim the benefit of the doubt in this case, itiscertain that he cannot be acquitted of almost ascruel a crime in trying to destroy Joanna by openlyaccusing her of the murder of her husband, in orderto rise himself on her ruin. He held her up touniversal execration ; and if he did not murder theKing, he murdered the fair name and reputationof the young Queen.Charles Artus and his son, whether innocent ornot, behaved as if they were guilty, for they fledprecipitately immediatelyafterthe murderhadtaken place, and took refuge with the Empressof Constantinople, who has in consequence beenaccused, with great presumption of truth, of beingBut if the letters whichone of the conspirators.the King of Hungary afterwards alleged that theDuke of Durazzo wrote to Charles Artus weregenuine, Durazzo was certainly one of the con-spirators, for in this letter the murder was plannedand arranged.Inspite of hisvileassertionsagainstJoanna, notaparticle of circumstantialevidence was everforthcoming againsther, oragainst Louis of Taranto, in all the inquiries whichfollowed, and the only evidence against NicholasThe Murder of Andrew;93Acciajuoli was his intimacy with the Empress ofConstantinople.Much has been made by Joanna's enemies ofthe fact of the court going to Aversa. They allegethat she inveigled Andrew there in order to get ridof him more easily, but we have already explainedthe reasons for this customary villeggiatura. Wemust now note that the only historians of anyrepute, contemporary with Joanna, who have accusedher of complicity in the murder were the twoVillanis, both very credulous men, and MatthewVillani was anintimatefriend of NicholastheHungarian, the tutor of Andrew.It was, of course,to this man's interest to calumniate Joanna, for theonly hope the Hungarians had of regaining theirthe kingdom was by destroyingascendencyinJoanna's influence and reputation.After the King of Hungary received the Queen'stouching letter, containing theterrible news ofAndrew's assassination, he issued a manifesto toall the sovereigns of Europe announcing the deathof his brother ; and it is very remarkable, in viewhe makes noof his subsequent conduct, thataccusation against the Queen in this first documentlater on, when he found that it might be practicableThento seize her kingdom, he inculpated her.it was that Pope Clement VI., who was inbetter position to know the truth than any oneelse in Europe, wrote a letter to Louis, in whicha94The Beautiful Queenliesaid, "As to the murder of Prince Andrew,Joanna can neither be convicted nor suspected ofit, and still less has she confessed it."Petrarch was convinced of her innocence, and,although he was not at Naples at the time of themurder, he obtained all his information from hisintimate friend, the Bishop of Cavaillon, who wason the spot.Boccaccio was also at the court when the tragedyoccurred ; and he and two of the most celebratedlawyers of the day, Angelo and Baldus of Perugia,not only believed in Joanna's innocence, but also inher incapability of such a crime, Angelo calling her" a most holy Queen, the honour of the world andAnd here we may mentionthe light of Italy."that Joanna is known to this day among Neapolitansas " the good Queen Jane " ; and as the boatmenrow past the grim castle of Muro, in which shewas eventually imprisoned and murdered, they raisetheir caps in honour of " the good Queen."But the most conclusive piece of negative evidencein favour of Joanna is the fact that her great andcruel enemy, Pope Urban VI., himself a Neapolitan,once Archbishop of Bari, when he fulminated hisBull of excommunication and depositionJoanna, never breathed a word of reproach or accu-sation of her having consented to the murder ofagainsther first husband.Lastly, all the best Neapolitanand Provencal historians, and all the most enlightenedThe Murder of Andrew95of her contemporaries, have entirely exonerated herin this matter.One of Villani's assertions against Joanna, promptedno doubt by Nicholas the Hungarian, is that sheshowed little or no concern at the death of herhusband ; but thisisflatly contradicted by therepeated declarations of Pope Clement VI., that shealways expressed the greatest horror at the murderof Andrew, and deplored his tragical fate with thedeepest grief.
