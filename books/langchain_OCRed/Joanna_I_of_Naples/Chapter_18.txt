CHAPTER XVIIIJoanna's Fourth MarriageTHE next event which disturbed Joanna's troubledreign was the rebellion of the Duke of Andria,which was coincident with the visit of St. Bridgetto Naples, and resulted ultimately in the loss ofThis ambitious man had married Mar-Piedmont.garet of Taranto, by whom he had two children, aThe son was now, by theson and a daughter.will of his late uncle, Philip, who made him hisheir, Prince of Taranto, and he and hisnow combined together to seize the lands of thebarons surrounding their own dominions, with whichthey were not content. The first place they tookwas the town of Matera, which belonged to thefatherSanseverini, the most powerful family in the kingdom,who at once appealed to the Queen.well-trusted officer to remonstrate privately with theDuke of Andria on his conduct, and to offer in hername to arbitrate for him.63Joanna sent a264The Beautiful QueenThe Duke treated her ambassador with greatinsolence, and refused to consent to any arbitrationor to give up Matera.Joanna, unwilling to resorttoextremes,assembled the Andria family, andsentthem inbut allin vain.turntoremonstrate with him,She then commanded him toappear before her in person, but this Andria re-fused to do.Joanna, finding that her clemency was lost uponher contumacious subject, now called a meeting ofher council, and, seated upon her throne, passedsentence upon the Duke, commanding the Sanseverinito occupy not only the lands of which the Dukehad deprived them, but also his possessions in Apulia,which were held by him in fief to the crown, andnow belonged to it in forfeit of his disobedience andrebellion.The Duke had assembled all his forces in theneighbourhood of Naples, intending to invade thecapital, to force the Queen to yield to his wishes.However, the Sanseverini were strong enough todefeat him and drive him back from Naples, andto lay siege to the two adjacent towns of Tiani andSessa, which he had strongly fortified.The Neapolitans suffered severely during the siegeof Tiani, from want of provisions, and Joanna wentabout the city from piazza to piazza in her armour,soothing the people and exhorting them to endureprivations bravely for a time, as it would be to their;Joanna's Fourth Marriage265The siege lasted five months,future advantage.and then the Duke of Andria, seeing his cause washopeless, fled in the night, ordering the citizens tocapitulate if the enemy would setDuchess, whom he had left behind him.at liberty theJoanna, however, insisted upon an unconditionalsurrender, and at the end of a fortnight the garrisonyielded, and the Duchess was immediately taken toNaples.

The condottieri had certainrules, which they observed faithfully ; for instance,they spared each other, they demanded enormoussums for their services, but they always sent theirprisoners back without a ransom.Otho was about the same age as Joanna ; hewas very popular in Italy and was handsome aswell as brave and good, and upon him Joanna'schoice fell. And it was fortunate for her that it did,for he was the best of all her husbands, thoughunable to save her from the final tragedy whichclosed her life. He was generous and faithful to allhis engagements, he was neither greedy nor am-bitious, and agreed to the condition which Joannaimposed.of King, which she feared would excite the envy ofThis was that he should not bear the titleCharles Durazzo, but every other honour that it was268The Beautiful Queenin her power to grant him she bestowed upon him.She gave him the principality of Taranto, which hadbeen forfeited, and it is thought that one of her greatreasons in marrying him was that he might under-take the government of this part of her dominions,which it would have hardly been safe to entrust toany one who was not thus closely allied to her.She was forty-six when she married Otho, butshe was so well preserved that she was still extra-In character Otho is saidordinarily youngr-looking.to have resembled her so much that the greatestharmony and affection existed between them ; and atlast, after three ventures which can none of thembe described as ideal marriages, Joanna made ex-perience of conjugal happiness, though it came latein life, and was destined not to be of very longis gratifying to know that sheduration.Stillitsecured at least a lustre of real happiness from thatstrange mixture of joy and sorrow which we call life.Strange to say, on the same day that Joanna andOtho were married Ambrose Visconti, who hadbeen a State prisoner in the Castel del Ovo since hisrebellion against the Queen, made his escape fromWhether there was some relaxation in thewatch kept over him on this august occasion, orprison.for her mercy towhether Joanna, socelebratedthose who had offended her, had given orders thatan opportunity for escape should be given him, wedo not know.Joanna's Fourth Marriage269There was a celebrated astrologer living in Pro-vence when Joanna was born, named Anselmo, whowhen consulted as to whether theroyal infantPrincess would marry answered, " Joanna maritaberiscum Alio."The superstitious Neapolitans nowdeclared that the interpretation of this hitherto cryp-tic utterance was that Alio represented the initialletters of the names of her four husbands, Andrew,Louis, James, and Otho, which seems rather far-fetched.If Joanna married a fourth time to please her-self, she did not please her adopted son CharlesDurazzo,nor his wifeadopteddaughter and niece, who were both very angry,fearing that if there were any issue from the Queen'sMargaret, hermarriagethey would lose the crown,althoughJoanna took every opportunity of assertingherintention of leaving it to Charles Durazzo, her mostThis fourth marriage took place inungrateful heir.1374, according to Costanzo ; other writers, whoappear to have copied each other, put the dateat 1376.At the time of Joanna's fourth marriage, andfor a few years after, Naples was the only part ofItaly that was at peace, for the Florentines and theViscontis had invaded the Papal States, and theprincipal cities belonging to the Papacy, Bologna,Perugia, and Pavia, took this opportunity to de-clare their independence.270The Beautiful QueenThe Pope at first tried to bring back the Floren-tines and the revolted cities to their allegiance byfatherly persuasion; but as they disregarded all hisovertures and promises of pardon if they submitted,he summoned the Florentine magistrates to appearbefore him at Avignon.But instead of obeying hisorders, they ill-treated his messengers, and Gregory,now driven to exercise his authority if he wishedfor peace, issued a Bull of Excommunication againstthe Florentines, dated April 30th, 1376.This wasa most severe punishment, for it absolved all theirsubjects from their allegiance, and by it they forfeitedall their rights and privileges as citizens, and theirestates in every part of the world became the pro-perty of any one who could seize them.princes were forbidden to receive them into theirForeignkingdoms, except as slaves, and their children to thethird generation were proclaimed incapable of hold-ing any office, either ecclesiastical or civil.This terrible punishment destroyed the trade ofFlorence completely, and the citizens soon tried tomake their peace with the Pope, for besides all thesetemporal deprivations, they were also deprived ofthe Sacraments, except in the case of the dying.Intheir distress the Florentines now appealed to thedyer's daughter afterwards known as St. Catherineof Siena, whose reputation for sanctity was evengreater than that which her contemporary St. Bridgetof Sweden enjoyed, and the Commune of FlorenceJoanna's Fourth Marriage271entreated her to go to Siena and intercede withGregory for them.St. Catherine was received with great honour atAvignon, and the Pope had such confidence in herjudgment that he entrusted her with full power tomake peace with the Florentines, knowing well thatshe would not do so at the expense of the Church.On her return to Siena the people rose against herand even threatened to kill her, but she escapedfrom them, and the Florentines then begged for themediation of the neutral States of Italy.Joanna and Otho exerted all their influence atAvignon and Florence, and were aided by theGenoese, and at length succeeded in procuring atruce.During this temporary peace the Florentinesprevailed upon St. Catherine of Siena to go asecond time to Avignon, and urge the Pope toreturn to Rome, promising to submit to the HolySee if he would remove it back to the Eternal City,but hinting plainly that if he -did not they wouldGregory, yielding at lastagain begin hostilities.against his own judgment to the remonstrances ofSt. Catherine, who like St. Bridget told him of thevisions and revelations she had had concerning him,decided to go back to Rome, fearing that if he dis-regarded the letters St. Bridget had written to him,and the solemn warnings of St. Catherine and Peterof Aragon—who also claimed to have had a revelationfrom Heaven, commanding the Pope to return—he272The Beautiful Queenmight be disobeying the will of Almighty God ; sohe set sail for Rome, whither he did not arrive untilJanuary 17th, 1377.In the meanwhile St. Catherine of Sweden, thedaughter of St. Bridget, had gone back to Romefrom Wadstena (where she was now Abbess in thefirst convent of the Brigittines) to labour for thecanonisation of St. Bridget.In 1376 Catherinearrived at Naples, bent on the same errand, namely,to collect a list of the miracles said to have beenperformed by St. Bridget during her visits to Naples,and to get the attestations of the Archbishop andbishops, and other witnesses of the truth of thesereputed miracles.There Catherine, who had no likingfortheQueen, didnotsee Joanna atall, though shestayedtwomonths atleast in the city.Pro-bably St. ' Catherine disapproved very strongly ofJoanna's many marriages, for she herself was notonly a "widow indeed," but she had never been awife except in name, having persuaded her husbandto let her live as his sister.Perhaps there may havebeen some jealousybetween these two women, both remarkable for theirAt any rate, there was no friendshipbeauty.between them such as had existed between Joannaand Catherine's mother.One of St. Catherine's Neapolitan friends was thewife of Jamotti, the Seneschal of Salerno ; and duringp. 272]GREGORY THE ELEVENTH.Joanna's Fourth Marriage273the Abbess's stay in Naples, Alfarina, as she wascalled, confided to her that her husband's love forher had turned to hatred, because she had borne himno less than seven stillborn infants, and he believed,with the superstition then so common among allranks, that she was accursed.Alfarina was againabout to become a mother, and she dreaded thatagain her hopes might be disappointed, and anotherlittle coffin be required to take the place of thecradle she had prepared.Catherine comforted herand encouraged her to have hope, and gave hersome relics of her mother so soon to be canonised ;and not long after the joyful sound of the wail of anew-born infant was heard in the palace, whichafterwards received the name of Bridget, and issaid to have been the first child in Italy so called.Gregory XI. received as enthusiastic a welcomeon his entry into hisSt. Urban V. had done.capitalashis predecessorThe reins of his whitecourser were held by Robert Orsini, one of the greatestRoman barons, and he was acclaimed with loud,These demon-joyful shouts of "Evviva il Papa!"strations were as hollow as a drum : he was besetfrom within by the insolence of the Roman nobility,and from without by war and rebellion ; and at theend of a year he decided to return to Avignon, butbefore he could carry out this intention he died onMarch 27th, 1378.On his deathbed he is said by some writers,18274"The Beautiful Queerithough others question it, to have warned his hearersto place no faith in visions and revelations, and tohave regretted that he had been led by them toreturn to Rome.At the same time it must beremembered that he was on the point of addingSt. Bridget's name to the Calendar of the Saintswhen his death occurred, and it was left to hissuccessor to continue her cause ; but the canonisationdid not take place until 1391, when Boniface IX.at last rewarded all Catherine's efforts on her mother'sbehalf.Although Gregory XI. had never been a greatfriend to Joanna, it was an unhappy day for herwhen he died, for his successor became her greatestenemy.Just before his death, foreseeing that therewould be great difficulties in the election of the newPope, Gregory published a Bull providing that insteadof the usual number of two-thirds of the votes beingnecessary to secure the election of the SupremePontiff, when the Conclave should meet for thatpurpose, a majority of votes should suffice.twenty-threeCardinals, eighteenThe Sacred College consisted at that time of onlyof whom wereThereFrench, four Italian, and one a Spaniard.was a strong feeling among the Italians, and especiallyamong the Romans, to force the Conclave to elect anItalian Pope instead of a French one this time,The city of Romeas the late Pope had foreseen.was now governed by a supreme magistrate calledJoanna's Fourth Marriage275the Senator, assisted by twelve Bannerets ; and duringthe time which elapsed between the death of Gregoryand the meeting of the Conclave, these Banneretsmet, and waited in a body on the Cardinals andwarned them that the people of Rome were deter-mined to have an Italian Pope, and in the eventof any one of another nationality being chosen theywould not undertake to protect the Cardinals fromthe violence of the populace.The mode of election of a new Pope and allthe arrangements for the Cardinals who form theConclave differ very little in the twentieth centuryfrom those which prevailed in the fourteenth. Romechanges very slightly in these matters—she is "sempereadem "; but the circumstances attending the Con-clave which followed the death of Gregory XI. wereso unusual, and the result was of such vital con-sequence to Joanna especially, as well aswhole of Christendom, that we must devote a littleto thespace to describing it, even though it be an oft-toldtale.
