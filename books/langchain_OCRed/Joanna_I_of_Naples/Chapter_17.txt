The writersof the sixteenth century speak of it with an en-thusiasm which is almost religious.It is also amirror of the manners and customs of the author'sage.It opens with a most vivid description ofthe Plague, and the plan adopted is a hundredtales related by seven ladies and three gentlemenwho make a villeggiatura from Florence to escapethat dread scourge.It is thought that the author owed, in a greatmeasure, the beauty of his style to his associationwith Joanna for so many years, for her eloquenceand the ease with which she spoke both Italian andthe Provencal language were a liberal education,Joanna and Charles of Sweden249and the Princess Maria was also famed for hermanners and conversation as well as for her wit.In 1 36 1, when Boccaccio was living at Florence,he was visited one day by a Carthusian friar, whoasked to see him in private, and then told him hehad a message for him from a member of hisOrder lately dead in the odour of sanctity, namedFather Petroni, who had died in May, 1361, inThe name of Boccaccio's visitor wasFather Joachim Ciani, and he informed him thata rapture.Father Petroni had begged him on his deathbed toseek the author of "The Decameron," and warn himthat unless he reformed his life and his licentiouswritings, of which he ought to be ashamed, hewould die very shortly, and suffer eternal punish-ment for his sins.Father Petroni also made several prophecies con-cerning other persons, among whom was Petrarch.Boccaccio asked Ciani how Father Petroni, who hadnever seen him or Petrarch, could know anythingabout them, and Ciani replied that not long beforehis death he had had a vision, in which many thingshad been revealed to him ; and to prove the truthof what he said, he communicated to Boccaccio some-thing concerning himself, a secret which he believedThis made such anno one knew but himself.uponBoccaccio, who wasimpressionby the prospect of an early death and a life ofeternal misery, that he was converted there andterrified250The Beautiful Queenthen, resolved to reform his manner of life,torenounce love and poetry, and even to part withhis library, which at that time contained little butprofaneliterature—which expressionthe classic Greek and Latin writers.then meantNot contentwith this change of life, which he faithfully carriedout, he gave himself up to the study of theology,and was ordained priest after receiving the minororders.He then wrote to Petrarch and told him of thevisit he had received, and of his resolutions, andasked him to accept his library in discharge of somedebts he owed thepoet.Petrarch was not sopersuaded of the truth of Father Petroni's warningsas Boccaccio had been, and endeavoured to dissuadehis friend from abandoning literature and partingwith his library, and concluded by offering Boccaccioa home in exchange for his books, which he declaredhe would not except on any other terms.Petrarch also urged that to deprive a man ofBoccaccio's age of his books entirely, when he hadcultivated letters so successfully hitherto, was todeprive him of what would be a great solace in hisold age, and he asked him how St. Jerome wouldhave been able to combat heresy as he did if he hadhad no books to help him.Boccaccio declined Petrarch's offer to live withhim, but he kept his books, and added the study oftheology to his other knowledge, and soon became aJoanna and Charles of Sweden251noted priest, and was entrusted with an importantmission by the Bishop of Florence.Soon after he became a priest, Nicholas Acciajuoliinvited him to Naples, and for a time they livedtogether in a palace at Amain ; but they did not geton very well, as Acciajuoli now ranked among thehighest princes, and apparently gave himself airsto one who had been his own familiar friend. Healso after a while treated Boccaccio shamefully, inthe hope of getting rid of him, and put him into amean lodging, badly furnished, and sent his menials,his cooks, lackeys, and even his mule-drivers andscullions to take their meals at the same table.Boccaccio soon had enough of this kind of thing,and left Amain and went to the north of Italy, tostay with Petrarch in Padua for three months.He then went to Certaldo, which was the birth-place of his father, and after spending some timethere returned to Naples, where he met with sucha warm reception from Joanna that her courtiers allvied with each other in doing him honour.Butthough the Queen made him the most liberal offersto remain attached to her court at Naples for therest of his life, he decided to return after a timeto Certaldo, where he was seized with the firstdangerous illness he had ever known, which ruinedhis strong constitution, and he never wholly re-covered from the effects of it.In October 1373, he began a course of lectures252The Beautiful Queenin the Church of St. Lawrence at Certaldo, on the"Divina Commedia." The commentary he then wroteon the first seven cantos makes two thick volumes,and his enemies said he tried to display his ownknowledge rather than to explain Dante's immortalpoem.In July, 1374, Petrarch died at Arqua, of afit of apoplexy, and Boccaccio thus lost his greatestand best friend, whom he only survived for eighteenHis lectures and the labour they involvedmonths.proved too much for his enfeebled strength, andon December 21st, 1375, he died at Certaldo. Bytheir deaths Joanna lost the two greatest ornamentsof her court, and two of her staunchest friends andadmirers, both of whom, as has appeared above, haveleft their tribute of praise to the unfortunate andbeautiful Queen of the Two Sicilies.About ayearaftertheaccessionof PopeGregory XI. there occurred one of the most romanticand dramatic incidents in Joanna's life—which wascertainly not wanting in either of these elements.It was connected with the second visit of St. Bridgetof Sweden to the Neapolitan court, which she made1 37 1, on her way to the Holy Land, whithershe, with her daughter Catherine and her two eldestinsons, Charles, Prince of Nericia, and Birger, twoyoung men of very different disposition and char-acter.Charles was a fine, handsome man, a brave soldier,Joanna and Charles of Sweden253but of passionate, even violent nature, and yet hehad great charm of manner, and was very muchHis father, who had been veryproud of his eldest son and his achievements in theliked and admired.hunting-field as well as on the field of battle, hadspoiled him, and he had given his mother a greatdeal of anxiety all through his life.She had greatinfluence over him, and could to some extent curbhis impetuous temper and love of the world, andby her early training had fostered the religious sideof his character—which was by no means a negligiblequantity, for if he had strong passions, he had alsovery strong faith in all the doctrines of the Catholicreligion,Birger, on the other hand, had never given hismother a moment's anxiety in his life : he was avery pious, devout man, of a studious disposition,very retiring, caring nothing for worldly pleasures ;he had neither Charles's personal beauty, nor hispower of attracting affection and admiration, andled a lonely life, occupying himself with works ofcharity and study.These two brothersarrived in Rome in thein order to accompany theirautumn ofmother on her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, onAs the boat whichwhich she was about to start.137 1,was toconvey the pilgrims to Naples left theharbour, St. Bridget turned toFather Peter ofAlvastra, her confessor, and said, as she looked at;254The Beautiful Queenthe party, " We shall all return safely except theone I love best"—a prophecy destined to be ful-filled.Joanna had just returned from Avignon, whereshe had had a most cordial reception from the newPope Gregory XI., when St. Bridget and the otherThe Nea-Scandinavian pilgrims reached Naples.politan nobility again hastened to offer their princelyhospitality to the Swedish mystic and her companionsbut this time St. Bridget preferred a quieter residence,seeing that she was a pilgrim, so they went to theHospice of Santa Maria dell' Avvocata, which ad-joined the monastery of the Brothers Hospitaliersof St. John.One of St. Bridget's first acts after her arrival inNaples was to ask for an audience of the Queen, herfriend, and Joanna graciously accorded her oneimmediately.She was apparently at the time staying in theCastel del Ovo, as it was there that the dramaticscene we are about to describe took place.Shereceived the Swedish pilgrims at a solemn audience,with all the honours due to the high rank of thePrincess of Nericia and her sons.Joanna was now about forty-three, and her majesticbeauty was by no means impaired, but had rathergained in dignity, by all the sorrows she had ex-perienced.It was seen to the very best advantage,as she was magnificently attired; her golden hairJoanna and Charles of Sweden255was worn brushed back, showing her fine fore-head, which was one of her best features, and wascrowned on this occasion with a diadem of pearlson black velvet, which seems to have been especiallybecoming.There was a tender look in her greatdark eyes, and the sweetest of smiles, for whichshe was famous, played round her lips,assheallheroverwere remarkable also forstood to receive her distinguished guests, toweringladies-in-waiting, many of whomtheir beauty, and sur-knights, amongrounded by hercourtiers andwhom the chief gentleman-in-waiting was one Lan-dolpho Crispano ; some of the royal princes werealso present.St. Bridget advanced first tokiss the Queen'shand, and then turned to present her two sons.Birger knelt at the Queen's feet, according to theetiquette of the court ; but Charles was so enchantedby the vision of grace Joanna presented to hisgaze, that he forget everything exceptJoanna'sbeauty, and pressing impulsively forward he seizedthe Queen in his arms and kissed her on the lips.The hot blood of the Neapolitan princes andgentlemen-in-waiting was raised to boiling point atthis unseemly conduct to their mistress, and instinc-tively their hands went to their swords, and butfor the restraining hand of Joanna on Crispano'sshoulder Charles's days would have come to anabruptconclusion.The Queen was not atall256The Beautiful Queenoffended at this Scandinavian expression of admira-tion, and behaved most graciously to the impetuousyoung Swede.St. Bridget was terribly distressed at this incident,for Charles had a wife in Sweden, with whom hewas not on the best of terms ; her piety did not suithis worldly taste and love of society, and it was saidhe would gladly be rid of her, and his subsequentconduct showed there was truth in this report.St. Bridget went backtothe Hospicedeeplymortified and grieved at what she foresaw wouldbe a great trial, for the Queen was again a widowand had seemed to be by no means displeased byCharles's sudden passion for her. The saint threwherself on her knees and then prostrated herselfbefore the altarin the chapelof the BrothersHospitallers on her return, and for the rest of herstay in Naples spent the greater part of her timethere.Here the sick were brought to her to heal,and here she poured out her heart in prayer forher son.Meanwhile Charles seemed to have abandonedthe idea of continuing his pilgrimage to the HolyLand, and to have made up his mind to remain inNaples, where he spent his days in following theQueen, and dancing attendance upon her ; and Joannaencouraged her Swedish lover, and it was saidseriously contemplated asking Charles to marry her.St. Bridget, on hearing this gossip, went to theJoanna and Charles of Sweden257Queen and told her that Charles already had a wifeWhether Joanna didseriously think of asking the Pope to dispenseand childrenin Sweden.Charles from his marriage vows, which seems in-credible, or whether she was unaware of his marriagetillSt. Bridget apprised her of it, or whether shemerely intended to employ Charles to fight her battlesfor her (for the incursions of Ambrose Visconti intoher dominions and the quarrels of the Neapolitanprinces made her councillors desire her to marry afourth time, so as to have some one to help herto defend her kingdom) we do not know. Howeverthis may be, she continued her friendship with thehandsome young Scandinavian warrior, and, to thegreat distress of his mother, they met frequently,and not allSt.Charles toleaveBridget's entreaties could induceNaples, whose Queen heapedpresents upon him.Joanna now issuedinvitations to one of thegrand or solemn balls for which her court wascelebrated, but when the evening arrived CharlesThe Queen sent a messengerdid not appear.with a command for him to come, as she wasexpecting him ; but on reaching the Hospice atwhich he was stayingthe messenger found hewas seriously ill with a sudden attack of fever,and too weak to leave his bed or to speak aboveHis illness, which was fatal, lasted aa whisper.fortnight, during which time St. Bridget scarcely7258The Beautiful Queenlefthisbedside, watching and praying forhisrepentance, which, if tardy, seems to have beensincere.When the news of his death was communicatedto the Queen, Joanna commanded that Charles'sfuneral should be celebrated with the pomp befittingone who was of high rank and on terms of intimateThe Archbishop of Naplessung the Requiem in the cathedral, and a veryfriendship with her.grand procession followed the remains of the hand-some young Swede to the Franciscan monastery ofSanta Croce, where he was buried.His death wasone of the greatest sorrows of St. Bridget's life ;she was seventy when it occurred, but she waspresent at his funeral, and almost immediately afterleft Naples, with the other pilgrims in her train,for the Holy Land.The Swedish saint paid one more visit to Naples,about two years later, on her way home fromJerusalem to Rome, where she was living, andwhere she died soon after. On her arrival thistime at Naples she found the city sufFering fromthe Plague, and Joanna, the Archbishop of Naples,and the citizens were all assembled at the harbourTheyto greet her when her galley was sighted.implored her to deliver their beautiful city fromthis terrible scourge ; for her reputation was so greatthat the Queen, as well as the people, believed shehad the power to drive it away by her prayers, forJoanna and Charles of Sweden259in those days this dread disease was considered apunishment from Almighty God.St. Bridget was not slow to take advantage ofthisbelief, and answered that " penitencealonecould turn away the divine anger from kings andpeoples, and that she would pray forguidance,and tell them what Almighty God revealed to heron the subject."The result of the saint's prayers was that shewrote a severe letter to her friend the Queen,inthe course of which she admonished her asfollows :" Confess your faults with sincerity, and firmlyThink on the manner inresolve to amend them.which you have fulfilled the duties of wife andQueen.Restore any wealthunjustlyacquired.Be justsubjects from as many taxes as you can.before you aregenerous.Free yourSurroundyourself with frank, wise, and disinterested counsellors.Do not paint your beautiful face, lest by so doingLove and solacesouls should be lost.Be humble.the poor.Meditate upon the Passion of Christ,and fear the Lord, for you have led a life of easerather than that of a Queen.
