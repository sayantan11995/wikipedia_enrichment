CHAPTER HIPetrarch's First Visit to NaplesONE of Joanna's many claims to fame is, shewas the friend of Petrarch and Boccaccio, thetwo greatest geniuses of her time, both of whomhave eulogised her in enthusiastic terms in theirimmortal writings.She was only thirteen whenPetrarch paid his first visit to the court of Naples,in1 341, to submit his writingsto the learnedKing Robert for examination before he acceptedthe crown of laurel, although he was already sofamous that this examination was unnecessary.Francis Petrarch was now thirty-seven, and sostrikingly handsome and of so fine a presence thatwherever he went he attracted attention, and hewas an ornament to any court. He was tall andvery manly in appearance, with fine features andeyes full of fire ; he had a clear, ruddy complexionand a countenance that betrayed the genius andimaginative power which distinguished his writings.A highly accomplished scholar, he was a philosopher33334The Beautiful Queenand a theologian as well as a poet of the first water ;but he was more and higher than all this, as thefollowing words of his will show." I love truth," he says, " and not sects.I amsomething of a Peripatetic, a Stoic, or an Academician,and often none of them, but always a Christian.To philosophise is to love wisdom : and the truewisdom is Jesus Christ.Let us read the historians,the poets, and the philosophers, but let us havein our hearts the gospel of Jesus Christ, in whichalone is perfect wisdom and perfect happiness."He was the intimate friend of Cardinal JamesColonna, who was one of his greatest patrons, andintroduced him to his family, the noblest and mostprominent in Rome.After leaving the universityof Bologna, Petrarch had spent a year in Avignon,and amid all the beauties of the magnificent andbrilliant court there had remained heart-whole : inhis own words, he was " free and wild as an untamedButstag," though of a most passionate nature.before he left Avignon he was destined to meet hisfate.On Palm Sunday, 1327, he went to Mass in themonastery of St. Clare, and for the first time sawLaura, dressed in a green robe embroidered withviolets. Her wondrous beauty, as we learn fromthe Sonnets of Petrarch, at once captured the poet'sheart, and she became the idol of his adorationand the inspiration of his verse.But alas ! sheFrom a print by Raffadle Morghen, after a picture by TofanelluPETRARCH.P- 34]Petrarch's First Visit to Naples35was already the wife of another.Possessed of ahandsome dowry, her mother had married her whenvery young to one Hugh de Sades, who held ahigh position in Avignon, Laura's native city.She was an honourable woman, a faithful wife,and neither an allegorical myth nor the mistressof Petrarch, as some romancers have said in anage when calumny was rife.Equally false wasanother report, that Urban V. had granted Petrarch,who was in holy orders, a dispensation to marryLaura and that Petrarch had refused it, saying" thetie would sullyaffection."Urban V. did not come to the throne till after theconjugalhisdeath of Laura.Laura, on discovering the poet's passion for her,treated him with chaste severity, avoiding him ifthey met by accident, and when forced to meethim in any public place or social gathering shewore a veil, against the use of which he lamentsin one of his sonnets.She also terrified him bythe austerity of her expression.When he went to Naples Petrarch was still underfascinations, and indeed hethe spell of Laura'sdesired the honour of the laurel crown more forThe custom of crowningher sake than his own.a genius with a laurel crown in Rome had beenabandoned for a thousand years, and there wasnow aquestion as to whether Petrarch shouldreceive this honour in Rome or in Paris ; but he3 6The Beautiful Queenultimately decided to go to Rome, if Robert, Kingof Naples, pronounced him worthy of such anhonour.The King entertained the poet by showing himthe wonders of his beautiful capital, and especiallyby taking him to visit the supposed tomb of Virgilat the entrance to the Grotto of Posilipo, whichwas then darker and narrower even than it is now ;but it was held so sacred, Virgil having been supposedto have made it so by incantations, that no robbersdared to infest it.Then Robert held a public examination of thepoet, which lasted for five days, during which theking questioned Petrarch on all kinds of subjects,scientific and philosophic ; Petrarch lectured onpoetry and history, astonishedthe King by hiswisdom and learning, and almost converted him tobecome in his old age a lover of poetry, which heAt the close of this exami-had hitherto scorned.nation the King in the presence of the Queen,Joanna, and all the princes and princesses of thecourt, pronounced a sort of panegyric on the geniusof the poet, and declared him worthy of the laurelcrown.Robert desired that the ceremony of coronationshould take place at Naples, but Petrarch preferredto be crowned in Rome, where, as he explained tothe King, Virgil, Horace, and so many other poetshad received this honour.Accordingly PetrarchPetrarch's First Visit to Naples37left Naples in the beginning of April for Rome ; butbefore he left, Robert took off the robe he waswearing, and, giving it to him, begged him to wearit at his coronation.During his stay in Naples Petrarchhis"Africa," an epic poem which he was then writing,to King Robert, who was so pleased with it thathe begged it might be dedicated to him.Petrarchreadpromised that it should be, and fulfilled this promiseafter the King's death. He was crowned in Romeon April 8th, 1341, wearing the King's robe ofstate, and accompanied by twelve young Romanmen clad inscarlet robes and wearing crowns offlowers on their heads. The ceremony was per-formed in the Capitol by the Senator of Rome.Among the learned men Petrarch met at thecourt of Naples were John Barrili and BarbatusSulmone, whom he compared to Homer and Virgil ;another celebrated man was the King's librarian,Paul of Perugia, a friend of our Richard de Bury,Bishop of Durham, said to have been the wisestman in England, and the author of a charming littleessay on the " Love of Books."Petrarch had metde Bury at the court of Avignon, and was onfriendly terms with him.He issaid to havepossessed the largest library in Europe.Boccaccio,with whom Petrarch was destined to become veryintimate on a later visit to Naples, had not yetwritten the Decameron, nor won the fame he after-38The Beautiful Queenwards enjoyed, and was atthistime living inobscurity in that city, and through the favour ofPaul of Perugia coming to the palace to visit theHere he met the beautiful Maria ofKing's library.Sicily, Robert's natural daughter, who became toBoccaccio what Beatrice and Laura were to Danteand Petrarch.Maria, who was witty and accomplished as well asbeautiful, had married a Neapolitan nobleman namedd' Aquino, but she was the constant companion ofher father, whether he was at Castel Nuovo or atone or other of his summer residences, either in theBay of Baiae, or Sorrento, or Amain, or some otherlovely spot in that land of beauty.Three days after Petrarch left Naples Boccacciomet Maria for the first time, and under preciselysimilar circumstances to those under which Petrarch,who probably told him the story, first met Laura,namely, in church—and, oddly enough, in the churchof St. Clare in Naples instead of St. Clare's atAvignon—and meeting, he straightway fell in loveThrough Maria he became acquaintedwith her.with Joanna, then nearly fourteen, " whose culti-vated mind," says Guinezelli, " appreciated all hismerit."It was the fashion at that time for every marriedwoman of rank to have some celebrated military orliterary man in her train as her lover, and he wasconsidered asindispensable an appendage as herPetrarch's First Visit to Naples39coronet :if a soldier, he fought for her and woreher favour on his shield ; if a poet, he dedicated hispoems to her exclusively. How far this devotionwent depended upon the character of the woman ;in Maria of Sicily's case it is believed to have gonevery far, for in those days Boccaccio had the reputa-tion of being somewhat lax in his morals.But wemust never forget that calumny was one of thebesetting sins of the age, and all stories of intriguesrequire to be taken with the proverbial pinch of salt.Giovanni Boccaccio, who was the natural son ofa Florentine merchant, was born in 1313, and ishis first works, " Thebelieved to have writtenRime," " The Filocolo," a very prolixeffusion," The Fiammette," etc., under the direct inspira-tion of Maria, who also suggested the " Decameron,"on which his claim to immortality rests, for in thishe appears as the maker of Italian prose.One more most celebrated figure among KingRobert's courtiers we must not omit to mention,for he is accused by some writers of playing theassassin's part in the murder of Andrew of Hungary,that ghastly tragedy which left a stain never yeteffaced on the most brilliant court of the fourteenthcentury.called his second Maecenas.This was Nicholas Acciajuoli, whom PetrarchHe was the son ofone of the very richest merchants of Florence, andoriginally came to Naples to negotiate a loan between4oThe Beautiful Queenhis father and the King.He was very good-looking, highly accomplished, and endowed withsuch charming manners that the Princess of Tarantomade him the tutor and governor of her son, Louishusband, and hisof Taranto,Joanna'ssecondyounger brother Philip.Acciajuoli was not onlya conspicuous figure in Robert's court, but also oneof the most important personages in Joanna's reign,for his influence over Louis was supreme, and thefriendship which grew up between them mostintimate.In the beginning of January, 1343, Robert felt hisstrength was fast failing, and, judging death to benear, he made his will, dictating it in the presenceof his counsellors. He made Joanna his universalheiress, not only of the kingdom of Naples, but alsoof the counties of Provence and Piedmont.IfJoanna died without issue, her sister Maria wasto succeed, and she was bequeathed a marriage dowryof 30,000 ounces of gold, with some lands for whichshe had to do homage to Joanna. To Andrew,in case he survived Joanna, he left the principalityof Salerno, for which he was to do homage to thethen reigning King and Queen.According to anagreement he had made with his nephew Canrobert,King of Hungary, he left Maria's hand in marriageto the eldest brother of Andrew, Canrobert's eldestson Louis, who had just ascended the throne ofHungary.Petrarch's First Visit to Naples41This marriage, if it ever came off, could onlyincrease the difficulty of Joanna's succession, becausethe elder member of the Neapolitan family wasalready married to the younger son of the Kingof Hungary, and his elder son was by this willto be united to the younger sister of Joanna. Robertthe Wise did not display his wisdom in the dis-Not contentposition of his two grandchildren.with marrying Joanna to an idiot, he now proposedto marry Maria to a semi-barbarian king, who wasdestined to become her sister Joanna's deadliestenemy.Robert would fain have made his Queen, Sancha,Regent of the kingdom during the minority of theyoung King and Queen, but she refused to acceptthe charge, being bent on entering a convent at herhusband's death. He therefore appointed a councilof regency with Sancha at the head of it ; the othermembers wereof Cabassole, Bishop ofCavaillon and Chancellor of the Kingdom of Naples,PhilipPhilip of Sanguineto, Seneschal of Provence, Geoffrey,Count of Squilazzo, High Admiral, and CharlesArtus, Grand Chamberlain of the kingdom.Joannaand Andrew, and also Maria, were not to attaintheir majority till they reached the age of twenty-five, and until that time all their edicts, gifts, andsales were to be considered null and void withoutthe consent of the Council.Finally Robert recommended the Queen, his4 2The Beautiful Queengrandchildren, and his dominions to the protectionof the Pope and the College of Cardinals. ThePope at this time was Clement VI., who was a goodfriend to Joanna after Robert's death. He was agreat Pope, clement by nature as well as by name,and one of the most profound scholars of his age,to whom Italian historians have not done justice,because of his preference for Avignon, where hiscourt was celebrated for its luxury and magnificence.As soon as his will was duly sealed and attested,Robert called Joanna and Andrew to his bedsideand endeavoured to impress upon them the solemnresponsibilities of their position, warning them ofthe dangers with which they were surrounded onsides, and apparently frightening them, for weallare told they wept so bitterly that he gently re-proved them for their grief.Three days before hisdeath, though very weak, he had himself carried tothe church of St. Clare, which he had founded, andthere was invested with the habit of the ThirdOrder of St. Francis, in which humble garb he died.He was only sixty-four at the time of his death.Petrarch says of him : " He died as he had lived,If Heavenspeaking and acting in the same manner.had positively decreed that he should not preventthe misfortunes which were to follow his death, itwas the greatest happiness that could have happenedto him, and I believe no man ever died at a morefortunate moment for himself."Petrarch's First Visit to Naples43With a poet's prescience of coming evil, and witha keen sense of his own prophetic powers, which thesequel justified, he wrote to his friend BarbatusSulmone, on hearing of the death of Robert, asfollows :"What I have so much dreaded has happened,What an afflictionour great King has left us !for me, my dear Barbatus !I fear to see his deathfollowed by the calamities I have predicted. Mymind is but too good a prophet when it announcesThe youth of the Queen and hersinister events.husband, the age of the Queen Dowager, her pro-jects, the dispositions and manners of the courtiers,make me fear everything.

" The lambs alluded to were Joanna andMaria, the wolves Friar Robert and the Hungarians.Joanna, who was now in her sixteenth year, was" fair and goodly to look upon," says Boccaccio, whoenlarges at great length on her intellectual gifts andher generous and fine disposition.Brantome, thecelebrated French chronicler who accompanied MaryQueen of Scots to Holyrood, says that Joanna'sexceededthat of Petrarch'sbeauty farLaura."
