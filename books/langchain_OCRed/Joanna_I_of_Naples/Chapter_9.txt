One saysAversa, atLouis, on reachingonce tookthatprisoners the Duke of Durazzo and all the princeswho had remained in Naples, including the littleCharobert, whom this writer says the Neapolitanshad brought with them in his cradle—which, seeinghe was two years old, seems improbable.Carraccioli,the author in question, says that Louis then orderedthe Duke of Durazzo to be beheaded on the samespot on which Andrew was murdered, and then keptthe others whom he had arrested chained in ironsmost strictly until he could send them to Hungary.We prefer to follow Villani's version, which tellsus that Louis, persisting in his demand to be shownthe spot where Andrew was murdered, was led toThe King of Hungary's Vengeance131the Celestine monastery, where they all dismountedand proceeded to the castle, going up to the galleryin which Andrew was first seized, and then on to thebalcony from which he was hanged and thrown overinto the garden.When they reached this spot the fury of the KingHe turned to Durazzo in aknew no bounds.transport of rage, and said :" You have been a false traitor, and compassedthe death of your lord my brother, and intrigued inPapal court together with your uncle, thetheCardinal of Perigord, who, at your request, delayedand endeavoured to prevent his coronation, whichshould, as was becoming, have been performed bythe sanction of the Pope, and this delay was thecause of his death." With fraud and deceit you obtained adis-pensation from the Pope to take your cousin, hissister-in law, to wife, in order that, by the death ofhim and the Queen Joanna, his wife, you mightbecome King in their stead." Moreover, you have been in arms with thattraitor Louis, Prince of Taranto, our rebel, who hasdone as you have done, and with fraud and sacrilegehas married that iniquitous and adulterous woman,her King and husband, who wastraitoroustoAndrew, our brother, and therefore itthat you should die where you caused him to die."isfittingDurazzo vehemently protested his innocence, and3 2The Beautiful Queenimplored the King's mercy, but in vain.Louis nowproduced the letters to Charles Artus, written inDurazzo's name and sealed with his seal, concoctingthe assassination of Andrew, and then demandedhow he could excuse himself.Without giving the unhappy Durazzo time toexamine the documents in question, which are con-sidered to be of very doubtful authenticity—forCharles Artus was not yet taken, so it is not easyto see how they could have come into Louis'spossession, and Durazzo's seal was easily imitated,as it was well known all over Europe—the angryKing called forward one of his suite, who stabbedthe unarmed Duke in the breast, while anotherHungarian seized him by the hair. A second stabin the throat, which partially severed his head fromhis body, killed him.Nothing can justify the conduct and treachery ofLouis in this murder.It was a gross breach offaith and trust, it was a dastardly action, cowardlyin the extreme ; and whether Durazzo was guiltyof Andrew's death or not it was unjust, becausehe was murdered without any trial or examination,or witness against him except these very doubtfulletters.Under pretence of zeal to punish his brother'smurderers, Louis was bent on obtaining the crownof the Two Sicilies for himself ; and as Durazzo wascertainly aiming at the same object, he was a specialThe King of Hungary's Vengeance133object of hatred to Louis, who had not forgiven himforstealing his bride, Maria of Sicily, from him.But, fortunately for Joanna, his zeal outran hisdiscretion, for this foul murder, coupled with histreachery, revolted the feelings of all classes, rich andpoor, against him, and a reaction set in in favourof the Queen.Not content with murdering Durazzo, he threwthe body over the fatal balcony and forbade any oneto bury ittill he gave permission, thus denying hisvictim, whom he had already deprived of the lastSacraments, Christian burial.He seized all the other princes who had been hisguests an hour before, and threw them into theCastle of Aversa as prisoners for the present, untilhe could make other arrangements for taking themto Hungary. He then set out for Naples, but hewas met at Melita, which is half-way between thecity and Aversa, by a deputation of the citizens, whosaluted him with the greatest reverence—of whichhe scorned to take the least notice, but rode intoNaples as a conqueror, his terrible banner carriedbefore him, his helmet on his head, refusing to passunder the canopy which the chief nobility broughtout to hold over him.He also declined to meet the governors of thecity and the representatives of the nobility, butdemanded the keys of the city to be given up tohim, and sent them to Hungary in token of con-i34The Beautiful Queenquest. He then let loose his soldiers with ordersto destroy all the palaces of the royal family, andthe terrified Neapolitans feared he was going topillage the whole city ; but this he forbade his soldiersto do, his chief wrath being directed against all theroyal princes.Louis then held another inquiry—or rather in-quisition, for torture was the means employed toget evidence—into Andrew's death, and many nobleswere executed as the result of these mock trials ;the real object of which was to obtain incriminatingevidence against Joanna, and to remove all thebarons who were opposed to the Hungarian cause.The first object was completely defeated, for neitherdeath nor torture could extort a word of evidenceagainst the Queen ; another proof of her innocence.Louis now took possession of little Canrobert,Joanna's child, whom he loaded with caresses andthen sent him to Hungary with the other princes.The child did not live very long after reachingHungary, and it was far better for Joanna that hedied there ; for had his death taken place in Naples,her slanderers would have said that he had beenmurdered to make room for the children of herThe other royal princes weresecond marriage.sent, chained, to the Castle of Wisgrade, which isas a roomy prison, but " where theredescribedwas little to have and less to spend."In the meanwhile Maria of Sicily, the youngThe King of Hungary's Vengeance135Duchess of Durazzo, was waiting in the CastelNuovo to meet the Hungarian King, whom sheexpected to return with her husband, who had goneto meet him. Her two children were with herwhen a messenger arrived to inform her of theKing of Hungary's treachery, and the horriblemurder of the husband of her youth, whom sheloved passionately, and who had saved her frommarrying Louis of Hungary, whom she hated.

We canwell imagine the sensation her arrival must havecaused among the monks, when the young Duchessof Durazzo, who was second in rank only to theQueen, knocked at their postern-gate disguised asa poor beggar, carrying two babies in her arms, the136The Beautiful Queenelder of whom could not speak, while it was plainlyvisible that a third child would soon be added toher family.

To preventthis sale, which neither their pride nor their affectionshe was going toendeavour toeffectthatherselltofor the ancient Angevine rulers could brook, theysubjected Joanna to a captivity which they had thegrace to make as pleasant as possible under thecircumstances, and in which she was treated withall the respect due to her as Queen and Countessof Provence, and we are told also with the utmostcourtesy.Maria, the widowed Duchess of Durazzo, wasonly eighteen when with her two little baby girls,Joanna and Agnes, shereached her sister, thecaptive Queen, who was separated from her ownlittle son. The meeting between the two sisterswas no doubt very touching, when after so manyperils Maria at last found herself in a place of safety,although that place was a prison.Both these young widows had lost their husbandssay, Andrewby a violent death, and, strange toand Charles of Durazzo had been murdered onthe same spot, and the same cruel enemy waspursuing them.Joanna, generously forgetting thatCharles of Durazzo had been a traitor to her, took138The Beautiful Queenupon herself the care and education of his children,and when the third child was born adopted her asher daughter. No doubt the two little babies ofMaria were a source of amusement and consolationto both sisters in their captivity, and to some extentatoned to Joanna for the loss of her boy, of whosefate she was so uncertain.We must now see what had become of Joanna'shusband and Nicholas Acciajuoli, who, when theyleft Joanna, had intended to proceed by differentways to Florence, where Angelo Acciajuoli, thebrother of Nicholas, was bishop, in order to enlisthis services on Joanna's behalf, for he was a manof great influence in the Papal Court.The fate of Louis and Joanna was, it may be said,If he judged them guilty ofin the Pope's hands.the murder of Andrew, he had the power to sendthem not only to prison, but to the scaffold ; while,on the other hand, if he pronounced them innocent,and took them under his fatherly protection, Joannamight recover her fair fame and her kingdom.It was therefore of vitalimportance to bothJoanna and Louis to leave no stone unturned toprocure a favourable verdict at the Court of Avignon,and they were most fortunate in being able toapproach such a powerful advocate as the Bishopof Florence with such an influential friend as hisbrother Nicholas to plead for them.Angelo Acciajuoli once proposed to pay PetrarchThe King of Hungary's Vengeance139a visit in his hermitage at Vaucluse, to see him andthe celebrated fountain, said never to have beenfathomed, which is the source of the River Sorgia,and rises in the midst of a gloomy cavern at thefoot of a huge rock.Petrarch, highly delighted atthe prospect of receiving so honourable a guest,scoured the neighbourhood to obtain delicacies toset before him when he should arrive.The Bishop, who was on his way from Avignonto Florence, was expected to the midday dejeunerat twelve o'clock.Everything was ready at thestruck, but noappointed time ;twelve o'clockBishop appeared, and the poet, who wanted hisluncheon, grew impatient, and while waiting wrotesome linestothePrioroftheneighbouringmonastery to the following effect :this."

He fears, no doubt, that he will meetwith the repast of a poet, and deigns not to visitgreat King Robert, wherethe place where thecardinals and princes have been : some to see theBut if I am unworthyfountain, others to visit me.to receive such a guest, it seems to me that he isstill more unworthy for breaking his word."i4°The Beautiful QueenBy the time these lines were written a greatcommotion was heard outside the hermitage, andthe good Bishop arrived, having been delayed onthe way.But to return to Louis of Taranto and his tutor.When they reached the Florentine frontierwere met by an embassy from the chief magistrates,theyforbidding them to enter Florence, lest by so doingthe inhabitants should suffer from the vengeance ofThe Guelph party in FlorenceLouis of Hungary.took no partthis protest, and were highlyindignant at it, for they owed much both to theinrelations of Joanna and to the uncle and brotherof Louis, who had laid down their lives for themin battle.But though the Florentines had received so manyfavours from Joanna's father and King Robert, aswell as from Louis's relations, the chief citizensdecided it would not do to run the risk of incurringthe anger of the Hungarian King, so Louis wasobliged to take refuge for ten days in the Castleof Valdepeso, which belonged to a chief of theAcciajuoli family.This was all the more galling to the Guelphsbecause a month before, when Philip Gonzago ofMantua, who had been fighting on the side of theHungarians, passed through Florence on his wayfrom Naples he was received with the honours theywished to show to Prince Louis of Taranto.The King of Hungary's Vengeance141Nicholas Acciajuoli was, however, too faithful andtoo clever a friend to his pupil, Louis, and to hissovereign, Joanna, not to find a way to help her ;so he chartered two armed galleys from Genoa, andon board them he and Louis sailed for Provence.But on nearing the shore they found they could notland with safety either at Marseilles or Nice, andthey heard the bad news that Joanna was incaptivity, the Barons in open rebellion, and Louis'sHungarian agents very busy doing all the mis-chief they could.Neither Louis of Taranto norAcciajuoli were men to be easily baffled ; they weredetermined to reach Avignon by hook or by crook,so they sailed past the Provencal shore to AiguesMorte, which is on French soil, and landed there,and, following the course of the Rh6ne, arrived atVilleneuve, on the opposite bank of the river toAvignon.Arrived here, all they had to do wasto cross the celebrated Bridge of St. Benezet atAvignon.Louis, however, thought it more prudentto remain at Villeneuve until he knew what kind ofa reception he would meet with at the Papal court,while Acciajuoli and his brother, the Bishop ofFlorence, ^who had joined them at Valdepeso, wentto see Clement VI. and consult with him as towhat was to be done to reinstate Joanna on herthrone.
