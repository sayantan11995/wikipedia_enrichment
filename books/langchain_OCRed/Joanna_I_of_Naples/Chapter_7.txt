and on December 23rdhe embarked from Naples for Marseilles, but aviolent storm drove him ashore on the coast ofHerculaneum, where he landed with difficulty.Inthe meanwhile a great commotion was going on atCastle Nuovo : the Queen was taken ill, doctorsand ministersof State were summoned tothepalace to await the interesting event, and whilethe storm was still raging Joanna gave birth to ason and heir.The Pope had already promised to stand god-father to her child, and the Cardinal Bishop wasrequired to represent His Holiness.Baptisms inItaly are celebrated within twenty-four hours ofWhat followed the Murder99birth, so messengers were at once dispatched toHerculaneum to bring back the shipwrecked Cardinalto stand proxy for the Pope.It was the custom to name the Neapolitan princesafter the paternal grandfather, and Joanna scrupu-lously observed this etiquette, and named her sonafter Andrew's father, Canrobert, the late King ofHungary.There were great rejoicings in Naplesat the birth of an heir to the throne, and these werea great consolation to Joanna, who looked uponthem as proofs of the affection and loyalty of thegreater part of the nation.The day after the baptism the Bishop of Cavaillonre-embarked for Marseilles, but he was caught ina more terrific storm than before ; and as he himselfrelates in his autobiography, which he wrote shortlyafterwards, he was saved this time miraculously bySt. Mary Magdalene, the patron saint of Marseilles,whom he invoked.this time ; and when the Cardinal arrived at AvignonPetrarch was in Provence atin January, the two friends met, and having hearddeCabassole'saccount oftheassassination ofAndrew and all he had done to discover the con-spirators, Petrarch wrote the letter from which wehave quoted, to his friend Barbatus of Sulmone.Surely if there had been the slightest truth in thescandalous rumours aboutCardinalwould have told his intimate friend, who alwaysJoanna, thebelieved in the Queen's innocence.looThe Beautiful QueenImmediately after the Cardinal left Naples thePope sent two bishops to theNeapolitan courtto take charge of the young prince,for Joannabeing a minor was not allowed to bring up herPerhaps Clement may have feared thatown child.there might be some foul play, as he knew theQueen was surrounded by traitors, and the murderof the King had made the Neapolitans a bywordall over Europe ; at any rate the Bishops of Paduaand Monte Casino arrived at Castel Nuovo beforethe baby was a month old.Joanna was now eighteen, and as soon as shehad recovered from the birth of the child she sentfor the most trusted friends of the late King Robert,and took counsel with them as to the best means tobe pursued to bring the murderers of her husbandto justice.She did not wait to ask the Pope'ssanction, knowing he would refuse it on account ofher youth; but she acted on her own initiative, anddisplayed that good sense and wise policy for whichshe was afterwards so famed.A deputation from the nobility of Naples waitedupon the Queen, and begged her to take the ad-ministration of affairs into her own hands now thatthe Cardinal legate, who had signally failed in hismission to discover the conspirators, had retired.The members of this deputation with remarkablefrankness told the Queen of the rumours whichwere afloat about her complicity in the murder,What followed the Murder101saying that some boldly accused her of it, and addingthat the disaffection was growing daily.Her next move was to cause to be affixed to herpalace-walls and to other public buildings a severeedict against the conspirators.She then signed; acommission empowering one of theNeapolitanbarons, named Hugh de Baux, to execute justiceon all who were found guilty, without respect ofpersons.This edict was signed in February, 1846(old style)—that is, five months after the assassina-tion, but the reasons for the delay have, we hope,been made sufficiently clear to exonerate the Queen.Joanna now wrote a second letter to Louis ofHungary, from which we shall quote the mostsalient passages.She says :" I hear that many wonder that I have sufferedthe parricides [sic] who have slain my husband andyour brother to go so long unpunished. What isthis, then ? Why do the people accuse me of thisgreat iniquity, when I have always dearly loved KingAndrew, my excellent husband, and he as long ashis life lasted always lived in peace with me ?Butwhatever the rest of men may suspect, I earnestlydesire that you should believe that it has not beenpossible for me to avenge this great injury done tome, from my ignorance of the assassins, and fromthe difficulties of the times, and that I have sufferedso much anguish of mind from the murder of mybeloved husband that, stunned by grief, I had well-102The Beautiful Queennigh died of the same wounds."The last sentencehas been quoted before in this book, but it is as wellto repeat it with the context in which it so naturallyoccurs and seems to give such unconscious evidenceFor if she had found Andrew aof her innocence.peaceable, excellent husband whom she loved tenderly,why should she have consented to his murder ?Hugh de Baux's methods of getting at the truth,or attempting to do so, were barbarous in the ex-treme, but they were the constant practice of theage in which he lived. He seized some of Andrew'schamberlains and proceeded to torturethem, toextractso-called confessions, in which no sort ofconfidence could be placed, for the victims wouldsay anything when on the rack.The Duke of Durazzo opposed the original planof holding these ghastly inquisitions in the halls ofthe public courts of justice, where all the peoplewould have heard them, and instead examined theprisoners in his own palace.This on the face ofit looks very suspicious, and as if the Duke hadonly too good reason to fear that he might beaccused himself ; whereas if the examination was heldunder his roof, the victims would say anything andaccuse any one but the Duke, in the hope of cuttingshort their sufferings.The chamberlains, Nicholas di Mirazzano andJacobo de Pace, made many accusations. Amongothers they accused Charles Artus and his son—no;What followed the Murder103doubt justly ; and then it was that these two fledto the Empress of Constantinople.Others whowere accused of being in the plot fortified them-selves in their castles, while Philippa and her sonthe Count d'Evoli, herher grand-daughter Sancha and her husband, who were alsodenounced, were all living either inCastelNuovo or in Naples, and daily frequenting theson-in-law,thecourt.Now itis very remarkable that none of thosewho were tortured, either now or later, ever accusedJoanna of being in any way connected with thecrime, and apparently she had never for one momentsuspected Philippa—her father's foster-mother, theold tried friend of her grandfather and QueenSancha, and her own faithful nurse and governessand friend, who had been all but a mother to her—of having had any part in the conspiracy.Philippa and her granddaughter Sancha had con-tinued to live at Castel Nuovo with Joanna, andwe can fancy Philippa, who had nursed Joanna andher father, now idolising the infant prince.She hadevidently been with the young Queen all throughthe terrible trials which had befallen her, and thereis no doubt that Joanna was greatly attached to herand therefore it can be imagined how great was herhorror when the messengers of Hugh de Baux,to whom she had given such absolute power overthe murderers when he had discovered them, arrived104The Beautiful Queenat the palace to arrest Philippa and Sancha.Theyare said to have been sitting with the Queen, eitherat their spinning-wheels or embroidery-frames, whenthe guards entered the room and dragged themforcibly from Joanna's presence, in spite of her pro-Philippa, who musttestations, which were in vain.have been nearer seventy than sixty at this time, isdescribed by some writers as a decrepit old woman,while others say she was still handsome, though it istrue that Sicilian and Neapolitan women age muchsooner than their Northern sisters, so it is possiblethe Catanese may have been old in appearance aswell as in years.Sancha was only about twenty, a young wifein the prime of her beauty ; but neither her youthTheynor Philippa's age availed them anything.were dragged down to the sea-shore, and there,in the presence of crowds of people, were torturedThe mobin a manner too horrible to describe.was not allowed to come near enough to hear whatthe sufferers said under torture, but they were ableto witness the horrible proceedings.A place was prepared for the execution of thesetwo unfortunate women, who, whether guilty ornot, evoke our sympathy for the brutal manner inwhich this so-called justice was administered. Tothe scaffold they were dragged on a sledge, but,happily for her, Philippa died on the way thither,exhausted by the torments to which she had beenWhat followed the Murder105submitted ; while Sancha, whose tortures were evenmore horrible than her grandmother's, was burntalive.Philippa was disembowelled, and her headHer son,the Count d'Evoli, and her son-in-law, the Count ofaffixed to one of the gates of the city.Trelice, were not executed until August 2nd, and afew days later some of the other barons who wereThe mob was sodemoralised that after these executions they mangledarrested were put to death.the bodies of the executed conspirators with theirteeth and nails out of sheer vicious ferocity.Itis said that the Count d'Evoli was much favouredby Joanna in the beginning of her reign, but shewas as powerless to save him from execution asshe had been in the case of Philippa and Sancha.Joanna's whole life was, to some extent, saddenedby these events, for she was tenderly and deeplyattached to Philippa, and Sancha had been thecompanion of her childhood and youth, for theyhad been brought up together ; while Philippa hadnever been separated from her for a single dayever since her birth until the day she was draggedfrom her to torture and death.From that day the young Queen, taught by thismost bitter experience, never wholly trusted any oneagain ; from henceforth she bore alone the caresof royalty, and the solitude of those whose highrank places them above their fellow men.Before these trials befell the young Queen sheio6The Beautiful Queenis said to have been of a most joyous disposition,full of mirth and high spirits, loving gaiety andall the pleasures of the court ; but from henceforthdignity and majesty are thefirstcharacteristicsmentioned in every description of her.In privatelife she was from this time kind and affable ratherthan gay and lively, while in public life she wasnoted for her masculine energy and firmness.Boccaccio says of her that " from the time thatshe began to govern not in name only, but in fact,she conducted herself with so much prudence thatshe daily transacted the affairs of State with barons,warriors,counsellors, and otherministers, withsuch unblemished fame that neither the eyes norears of envy ever perceived anything with whichto calumniate her.She was modest in her mannerof living, and the very character of her beautywas ratherthat of majesty than ot softness orvoluptuousness."Yet she ever retained a charmof manner, which together with her beauty madeher the centre of admiration of her brilliant courtand the idol of the fcourtiers who surrounded her,while the fame of her majestic, or, as some writerssay, angeliclovelinesswas a theme of conver-sation in all the courts of Europe.It is not certain what became of Charles Artusand his son.It is said by some authors that theywere imprisoned at Benevento, and put to deathprivately there, out of respect to King Robert, ofFrom an engraving after the painting by Titian.GIOVANNI BOCCACCIO.p. ro6]What followed the Murder107whom Charles Artus the elder is believed to havebeen the natural son.Other writers deny this,and say that he was the husband of Robert's naturaldaughter, the Princess Maria of Sicily.The Empress of Constantinople, who had shelteredthem, died in the October following the execution ofPhilippa and Sancha. Her death took place at Naples.She was the last of the Queen's relatives of the eldergeneration, except Maria of Sicily ; and as now theDuke of Durazzo had rebelled against her, she wasdeprived of the society of her sister, and, the friendsof her youth having fallen on the scaffold, she wasmore than ever alone.The Princess of Taranto died without living to seethe marriage of Joanna and her second son Louisaccomplished, for which she had certainly plannedand plotted—if she had not actually, as many believe,arranged the assassination of Andrew to make wayfor Louis.The next trial that befell Joanna was civil war,brought about by the rebellion of the Duke ofDurazzo, who now openly accused the Queen of themurder of her husband, and hoisted his standardagainst her. He was joined by his own brothers andby his cousin Philip, the youngest of the sons of theEmpress of Constantinople, whose youth made hima prey to the flattery of Durazzo.Robert, the eldest of the Princes of Taranto, hadjust returned from Greece, and he and his second108The Beautiful Queenbrother Louis took Joanna's part, and commandedher troops and went out to meet the Duke ofBut while these princes wereDurazzo's forces.fighting against each other, both were dreading thatthe King of Hungary would invade the kingdomto avenge his brother's death.Joanna, foreseeing this event, had sent an embassy,with the Bishop of Tropea at its head, to Louisof Hungary, after the birth of her son, to deliverthe letter we quoted above, and the Bishop did notreturn until early in the following year, 1347 (oldstyle).Friar Robert and Nicholas the Hungarian hadalready gone back to Hungary, fearing the powerof their adversaries after the death of Andrew ; andthey had of course given their version of what hadhappened to their master, and had succeeded in somisrepresenting Joanna thatthey had convincedhim of her guilt, and Louis, burning with rageand the desire of revenge, was now making allianceswith other powers, and preparing a large army toinvade Joanna's dominions.The Bishop of Tropea reported all these thingsto Joanna on his return, and the threatening letterhe brought with him from the King of Hungaryto Joanna fully confirmed his observations.Louis, King of Hungary, surnamed the Great,who had succeeded his father Canrobert, or Charobert,in 1342, was one of the most powerful EuropeanWhat followed the Murder109monarchs of his time.His father had left thekingdom to him afterit had acquired under hisgovernment a high degree of splendour, for itembraced Bosnia, Servia, Croatia, Wallachia, Mol-davia, Dalmatia, and Transylvania, besides Hungary-proper.Louis was most warlike and ambitious :hefoughtsuccessfullythe Transylvanians,theCroatians, Wallachians, and Venetians, and, as weshall see, twice during Joanna's reign he invadedNaples and made himself aterrortothe in-habitants.His father, we know, had considered he had aclaim on the kingdom ; and when Joanna's sister,Maria of Sicily, whom Friar Robert had advisedLouis to marry, eloped with Charles of Durazzo,Louis was intensely annoyed, for this, as the wilyfriar foresaw, would have been a stepping-stone tothe coveted crown of Naples, which probably Louiswould in any case have endeavoured to wrest fromThe murder of Andrew gave him somethis, and when it wasattemptingJoanna.pretextforannounced to him his wrath and desire of revengeas well as of conquest knew no bounds, and areapparent in the following letter to Joanna."

As Hallampoints out, " The name of Joanna of Naples hassuffered by the lax repetition of calumnies." Headds that " the chargeof dissolute manners sofrequently made is not warranted by any specificproof or contemporary testimony."The second accusationthatshecontinued toretain the power of her kingdom only shows whatLouis was aiming at. What else should the Queenhave done ?It was her kingdom, and Andrew'sdeath in no way detracted from her claims.Whileher husband was alive the poor young Queen hadno power in her own kingdom, as we have seen,for Friar Robert and his Hungarian followers hadsupplanted her and her interests.The third accusation, of " neglecting vengeance,"we have been endeavouring to show was unavoidableunder the circumstances in which Joanna was placed.The fourth, of her " subsequent excuses," is moredifficult to refute, if we endorse the French proverb" qui s'excuse s'accuse "; but if Joanna had takenWhat followed the Murdermthe more dignified course of behaving as if she werewife, " above suspicion," and hadCaesar'slikescorned to defend herself, they would have saidthat her silence gave consent to the assertions of herguilt.The poor young Queen found herself in mostIt was most perplexingdifficultto know how to act, surrounded as she was on allcircumstances.sides by treason and treachery, her every actioncruelly criticised, and the worst interpretation putupon all her deeds : she did the best she could, andif venomous tongues aspersed her fair fame it wasno fault of hers.Directly she received Louis's cruelletter she called together her councillors and laid itbefore them, who recommended immediate prepara-tions for defending the kingdom from the impendinginvasion which it was clear Louis was bent uponattempting, and, as a most necessary preliminary step,they counselled their sovereign to marry again.
