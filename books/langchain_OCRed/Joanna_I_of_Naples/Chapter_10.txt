CHAPTER XJoanna Pleads before the Pope and CardinalsTHE cityof Avignon has many claimstoThe fact that it was the chosencelebrity.place of residence of the seven French Popes, from1309 to 1378, would in itself be sufficient to investit with an interest second only to Rome itself, butIt was, as we haveit has other claims to fame.already said, the home of Petrarch's Laura, and inone of its churches he first met her.Its streets andgardens were traversed by the poet and his belovedlady, and in another of its churches is her tomb.During the residence of the Popes it was visited bymost of the various European sovereigns, by theirambassadors, and, especially during the reign ofClement VI., it was resorted to by the most learnedmen in Europe.In the seventeenth century the celebrated Crillondied there and was buried there. He was one ofthe most renowned soldiers of the sixteenth cen-142Joanna Pleads before the Pope143tury, and distinguished himself during the reignsof five French kings, and was the first officer toreceive the title of Colonel-General of the FrenchHenry IV. of France always spoke ofinfantry.him as " le brave Crillon," and after the battle ofArques wrote on the battlefield this pregnant dis-patch to him :" Hang thyself, brave Crillon. We have foughtat Arques and thou wast not there."Another very celebrated man was a native ofAvignon, the Chevalier Folard, who was born therein 1669, and died there in 1752. He was one ofthe greatest tacticians the world has seen. He tookpart in all the wars at the end of the reign of LouisXIV., and supplied the generals under whom heserved with plans of defence ;he wrote severalworks on war-tactics and defence, all of course nowhopelessly obsolete, but most valuable at the timethey were published.At the close of his life he joined a Jansenistsect of fanatics known in France as the " Convul-sionnaires," whose vagaries gave rise to a celebratedThey used to visit the tomb of thewitty couplet.deacon Francois de Paris, one of their members,who had died in the odour of sanctity, and therethey fell into all sorts of convulsions, and pretendedthat miracles took place in this churchyard of St.At last they became such a nuisance thatMedard.the authorities were obliged to order the cemetery1 44The Beautiful Queento be closed.Whereupon some wag wrote uponthe gate :"De par le Roi defense a Dieu,De faire miracle en ce lieu."Another of these sects which sprang up someyears later, about 1373, was the Dancers ; they werethe offspring of the Flagellants, and originated inAix-la-Chapelle.They spread throughoutLiege,Hainault, and Flanders.These fanatics fell sud-denly into fits of dancing. Men and women joinedhands, and danced violently till they were almostsuffocated, when they fell to the ground and thensaid they were favoured with visions. The priestsdeclared they were possessed, and exorcised them. 1In the year 1226 the town of Avignon wasnearly destroyed by order of the Papal legate, sentthere to oppose the Count of Toulouse, who hadfavoured the cause of the Albigeois, and at the timeit had not recovered from theof Joanna's visitpunishment inflicted upon it, so that like Rome itpresented a striking mixture of great luxury sideby side with the direst poverty. Among the low,ill-built houses of the natives stood the magnificentpalaces of the Cardinals, and perched upon a grandriver Rh6ne was therock above thegloriousfortress-like but most splendid of all these mansions,the majestic palace of the Popes, which still survives,though now used as a prison.1 Mosheim, vol. i.Joanna Pleads before the Pope145Petrarch, who was most indignant at the luxuryof the Papal Court, thus comments upon thesebuildings." What a shame to seethese peopleraising magnificent palaces, resplendent with goldand superb towers which threaten the skies in thisnew Babylon, whilst the capital of the world liesin ruins !"The poet as an Italian could not tolerate withpatience the removal of the Holy See from Rometo Avignon, and with his usual exaggerated butpicturesque language he inveighs against it.In one of his letters called the " Mysteries " hethus describes the licentiousness of Avignon : " Allthat they say of Assyrian and Egyptian Babylon,of the four Labyrinths, of the Avernean and Tar-tarean Lakes is nothing in comparison with thishell. We have here a Nimrod powerful on theearth, and a mighty hunter before the Lord, whoattempts to scale heaven with raising his superbtowers.

He liked the society ofladies, and they were admitted to his palace andveryformed a court there, at the head of which wasCicely, Duchess of Turenne—Petrarch's " Semiramiswith her quiver."She married the son of AlphonsusIV., King of Aragon, and became Duchess ofTurenne in her own right by the death of herbrother, the Viscount, in 1340.This woman was excessively proud and imperious,and very cunning also, and managed to obtain avery strong influence over the Pope, and amassedgreat riches from all hands.She was the specialobject of Petrarch's hatred.She livedintheJoanna Pleads before the Pope147greatestsplendour,andcompletelydominatedtheCourtofAvignon,anddisposedofagreat deal of the patronage attached to the PapalCourt by virtue of her friendship with Clement,who allowedhimself to be influenced by her;notbut there isslightest ground for thewriters, whosuggestions of some unscrupuloushave calumniated the Holy Father by suggestingthethere was more than friendship existing betweenthem.The scenery round Avignon is most varied ; thedeep blue waters of the Rh6ne rush past the lordlypalaces, and receivethe Durance,which windsabout on the other side of the city.it wide avenues of elms surround the town.Just belowTheland is very rich : vines crown the hills, olive-treescover the meadows, while islands in the great river,magnificent trees, and rich fieldsmake a fairylike prospect.all combine toThe walls round the city were builtin 1358,but they are more ornamental than suitable for pur-poses of defence, and are flanked with square towers.The mystic number seven regulated everything inAvignon : there were seven gates in these walls,seven churches, seven monasteries, seven nunneries,sevencolleges,sevenparishes,sevenhospitals,and seven Popes lived there in succession—thoughthis last was by accident or coincidence, not bydesign. We must not forget to mention the cele-;H8The Beautiful Queenbrated Bridge of St Ben6zet * which spans theRhone at Avignon, on the opposite side of whichstands the town of Villeneuve, where on theirarrival Louis of Taranto remained, while NicholasAcciajuoli and his brother, the Bishop of Florence,went to Avignon to obtain an audience of thePope.Clement is said to have received them withhis usual courtesy and affability, and no doubtentertained them at one of his regal banquets, forhe was famed for the delicacy of his table as wellas for the sumptuousness of his furniture and tableappointments.His first step upon hearing their errand, andlearning of the imprisonment of Joanna, was tosend for the Duke of Normandy and prevail uponhim to leave Provence, and return immediately tohis own dominions, to show the Provencals thatJoanna was not about to sell Provence to him ; thisquieted their fears, and paved the way for Joanna'srelease.There was livingat Avignon at this time arelation of Joanna's, namely, the Due de Berri,who on hearing of her captivity also exerted him-self to obtain her release, working most zealouslyon her behalf. He went round to all the principal1 St. Benezet was originally a shepherd living in the second halfof the twelfth century.

on her shoulders glittered the crossesof the kingdom of Jerusalem—one of her titles being,it will be remembered, Empress of Jerusalem—andOverin her hands she bore her orb and sceptre.her head was carried the canopy of State, orna-mented with gold fringes, and its four gilt polesborne in turns by the highest noblemen in herkingdom.These canopy-bearers wore coronets upontheir heads and splendid attire.The Queen, who was theadmiration of allbeholders,herbeautycallingforthshoutsofdelight, was accompanied by her husband, Louisof Taranto, who must have felt intensely proudofhis youngwifeandsovereign,andalsoNicholasbyBishop of Florence, and by aAcciajuoliandhisbrotherthelargeescortofher Ultramontane knights, with theirladiesalldressed in great splendour.Some of these ladies15 2The Beautiful Queenwere carried in litters ; others sat on side-saddlesmade in the shape of a chair, which couldnothave had a very equestrian appearance.Joannawas an excellent horsewoman, and may have dis-pensed with this arrangement ; her palfrey was ledby two knights of princely birth.As the procession passed along the narrow crookedstreets it was delayed by the most cosmopolitan ofcrowds which thronged the city, attracted thitherfrom all parts of Christendom by the presence ofthe Pope, and itis not likely that in those dayscrowds were regulated as they are in twentieth-century London.The convent of the Ursulines had long been theusual place of residence of the sovereigns of Napleswhen they visited Avignon, and here they stoppedfor the Queen to alight to take the customary re-freshment of wine and confectionery, and also togive the Cardinals time to meet in the ConsistoryCourt at the Papal palace, before which she was nowabout to appear and plead her cause.This court was held in one of the magnificentlyproportioned halls in the Pope's palace.It wasarranged with a throne of crimson and gold for thePope, raised above all the other seats, at one end,and round this, arranged in a semicircle, were seatedthe Cardinals, on a lower level ;they were allvested in their robes of scarlet silk, with their goldcrossesupontheirbreasts and their jewelledJoanna Pleads before the Pope153The Popeepiscopal rings on their right| hands.is said by one author, from whom we are nowquoting, to have worn the triple tiara.This is amistake.
