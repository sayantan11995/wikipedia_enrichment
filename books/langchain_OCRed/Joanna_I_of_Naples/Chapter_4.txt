He won the more mercenary nobles over bypromises of promotion, and soon found himself atthe head of a party powerful enough to defy thePope himself.He treated both Joanna and the Queen Dowagerwith the greatest insolence, and claimed everythingright of Andrew alone, making Joannapractically a State prisoner, while the Hungarianstheinpressed themselves everywhere, to the exclusion ofthe Neapolitan princes and nobles.The princes of the blood, banished from courtby the haughtiness of the Hungarians, retired totheir own castles, leaving Joanna to the mercy ofthese barbarians—the lamb among wolves, as PetrarchThe lamb, however, was notso aptly called her.altogether unprotected.Philippa was with her, and,for the first year after King Robert's death, theDowager Queen remained at Castel Nuovo, whereJoanna and Maria resided with her.The Lamb among Wolves51The Princess of Taranto also continued to live inNaples with her daughters, whilst her eldest sonRobert was absent fighting for her real or supposedrights as the titular Empress of Constantinople.This princess, seeing that Andrew was a mere toolin Friar Robert's hands, and utterly incapable ofappreciating either Joanna's beauty or her talents, orof doing anything except eat and drink, began, it issaid, to plan a marriage with Joanna and her secondson, Louis, trusting, if she succeeded in winningJoanna's affection for Louis, to persuade the Pope toannul her marriage with Andrew.There seems no doubt thatthePrincess ofTaranto didtry to divertthe young Queen'saffections from her boorish, idiotic husband to herown handsome, learned, brave, and attractive son,and in all probability it is equally true that Philippathe Catanese aided and abetted her in this to thebest of her power ; but that Nicholas Acciajuolijoined in this vile conspiracy to tempt Joanna to beunfaithful to her first husband, as some historiansbelieved by Costanzo, whom we arefollowing, to be a libel on so upright and honourableassert,isAcciajuoli owed everything to Robert, anda man.common gratitude to the late King would preventhim from joining in a plot to compromise Joanna'shonour, in days when the marriage-tie was not soeasily broken as now.Louis, as the sequel will show, was by no means5 2The Beautiful Queenso blind to his cousin's charms as was her husbandAndrew, but there is not a scrap of evidence toshow that the young Queen atany but a cousinly affection for Louis ; on thetime hadthiscontrary, she was so watched and guarded by theHungarians, that had she shown any preference forLouis, Friar Robert and his creatures would havebeen only too glad to seize upon any pretext to getrid of her and secure the throne for Andrew alone.Joanna was too fond of her grandfather, to whosecommands and wishes, both before and after hisdeath,she showed implicitobedience, and tooinnocent, to think of such a thing as abandoningher lawful husband for another more attractiveone.In the October following Robert's death PetrarchHe wasdeputed by the Pope to assert his right to ad-again visited Naples for two purposes.minister the government of the kingdom duringthe minority of the King and Queen, and furtherchargedby hisfriend and protector,CardinalColonna, to obtain the release from perpetual im-prisonment of the Pipini brothers, the Counts ofThey had beenMinervino, Lucera, and Potenza.sentenced to life-long imprisonment in the castle ofCapua by King Robert, for besieging Count Marra inThe Pipini were friends ofhis casde of that name.the Colonna family, whom they assistedquarrels with the Orsini, their hereditary enemies,in theirThe Lamb among Wolves53and the municipal authorities of Rome.Soon afterhis arrivalin Naples, Petrarch wrote to CardinalColonna, and in his letter gives such a graphicdescription of Naples that we cannot do better thanquote parts of it, for Petrarch was a very effusivecorrespondent, and hisepistleis too long to bequoted in full.He says : " Immediately on my arrival in NaplesI visited the two Queens, and went to treat withthe council on the subject of my coming.But ohinfamy of the world, what a monster ! May Heavenrid the soil of Italy of such a pest. ... I mournforthee,Naples, my beloved !that thou artrendered like to one of these Saracens—no pity,no truth, no faith, a horrible animal, with bald headand bare feet, short in stature, swoln in person, withworn-out rags torn studiously to show his nakedskin, who not only despises the supplications ofthy citizens, but from the vantage ground of hisfeigned sanctity treats with scorn the embassy ofthe Pope.Yet this is not marvellous, because hispride is founded upon the treasures he accumulates,for from what is reported it appears that his casketsfull of gold do not accord with the rags he wears.Perhaps you would know his name : he is calledRobert, succeeding, in this place, to that Robertlately dead who was as much the honour of ourage as this is its eternal infamy."Having enlarged on this theme, he continues54The Beautiful Queenfurther on : " He wears nor crown nor brocade norsilk, but with a squalid mantle, filthy and torn, whichcovers but half his swollen body, and with a crouch-ing gait, bent not by age, but by hypocrisy, he ruleswith unutterable arrogance and tyranny the courtsof both Queens, oppresses the weak, treads justiceunder foot, confounds all things human and divine,and like a new Palinurus or Tiphys * sits at the headof this great vessel, which from what I can discernwill quickly go to the bottom, as all the marinersare like himself, except the Bishop of Cavaillon, whoas much as he can takes the side of justice, abandonedby all the others."He goes on to tell the Cardinal to relate thesethings to the Pope, and to add that the Apostolicembassy would havebeenreceivedwith morereverence by the Saracens than it was in Naples.He also says he has been three or four timesto visit the Capuan prisoners, who place all theirThe old Queenhope of release in the Cardinal.has great pity on them, but can do nothing to helpthem, as Friar Robert was determined to keep themin prison ; Joanna and Andrew might have mercyon them, if Friar Robert and Nicholas, the governorof the King, would permit them.If Friar Robert had never done anything worsethan refuse to release these turbulent Pipini, weshould not have much to say against him, for they1 Palinurus and Tiphys were pilotsThe Lamb among Wolves55were not worthy of the interest Cardinal Colonnatook in them ; and their subsequent release, whichPetrarch persuaded Andrew to grant, only hastenedthe catastrophe which was impending on this un-happy King.Petrarch had many opportunities of conversingwith Joanna duringthisvisit, and was struckwith her talents and learning.have attached him to her court ; but asat thattime she was a Queen in name only, withoutpower to do good to any one, as she patheticallyShe would fainsaid of herself, this was impossible ; but she wasable to appoint him herdomestic chaplain andalmoner, an office only bestowed upon people ofdistinction.Shortly before coming to Naples for the secondtime, Petrarch had received further preferment fromPope Clement VI., who made him Archdeacon ofParma, and at the end of 1342 conferred upon himthe Priory of St. Nicholas, Pisa.The deed by which Joanna appointed the poether domestic chaplain was signed on the day ofa most terrifictempest,which occurredwhilePetrarch was in Naples, and is described by himwith his usual eloquence.This storm was causedby a violent sirocco, and was felt on all the shoresof the Mediterranean, but spent its worstfuryon Naples.It was predicted a few days beforeby the bishop of one of the neighbouring islands,5 6The Beautiful Queenas a scourge from God ; he also prophesied thatthe city would be destroyed by an earthquake onNovember 25th, when the storm actually happened.Happily this second part of the prophesy wasnot fulfilled, but itspread such terror throughthe city that the inhabitants prepared for death,business unattended to, and whenleavingthe first signs of the storm broke women rushedtheirhalf-clothed, with their babies in their arms, to thechurches,where they prostratedthemselves onthe floor praying for mercy.Petrarch, who confesses he was frightened bythe general consternation, went to spend the nightin the monastery of St. Laurence, where he wentto bed shortly before midnight, the monks havingretired at their usual hour.shaken from their foundations."

They took place in a part called theCarbonaria, amid the most brilliant and magnificentassemblage of nobility in Europe.Petrarch wasinduced to go to one of these entertainments, atwhich the young King and Queen were presentbut he left in disgust after seeing a young noblemanexpire at his feet, whereupon he put spurs to hishorse and fled.He used all his eloquence to try to disgust theNeapolitan nobles with these barbarous tournaments,but in vain ; they would not be persuaded to givethem up.establishedIt was during this visit of Petrarch to Naplesthat Joanna, for her own amusement and that of herher " Court of Love," orcourtiers," Parliament of Love," as these courts were called.They settled difficult questions on subjects connectedwith love and marriage, composed by their arbitrationthe quarrels of lovers, and awarded prizes to poetsand other writers.Joanna was chosen as President of the Court of62The Beautiful QueenLove, which was organised this year for her birthday-feast, and a story is told in connection with it whichthrows a light on the relations of Andrew andIt seems that when Joanna took her seatJoanna.under the canopy erected for her, there was anotherempty seat a little below hers, and Andrew tried totake it, but the young Queen waved him away fromit, saying :" Fair sir !

To counteract all this, the wilyfriar wrote to Louis of Hungary, Andrew's eldestbrother, begging him to come to Naples and marrythe Queen's sister Maria, according to the testamentof Robert, and to seize on the kingdom itself in hisown right, as the heir of his grandfather, CharlesLouis of Hungary was only too ready toMartel.fall in with these plans, but they were met by acounter-plot of the house of Durazzo, as we shallsee directly.The Dowager Queen Sancha remained only a yearin the world after her husband's death, and aboutthe first anniversary of it entered the convent ofPoor Clares in Naples, which she had herself foundedSancha had always, as we havesome years before.said before, hankered after the religious life, andnow seized the first opportunity of retiring from aThe Lamb among Wolves65world she despised, to join the strictest Order inthe Catholic Church and exchange the luxury of themost refined court in Europe for the coarse habit,and inclined board as a bed, of the Poor Clares.It turned out fortunate for her that she did so,before the impending tragedy which involved theruin of so many.this chapter.Petrarch's epitaph on King Robert may fitly close" Here lies the body of King Robert.He was the glory ofkings, the honour of his age, the chief of warriors,His soul is in heaven.and the best of men.Skilful in the art of war, heloved peace. ...
