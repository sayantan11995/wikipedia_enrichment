CHAPTER XIJoanna's Acquittal and its ResultsLATIN is the language of the Consistory Courtof Rome, and, as no mention is made of anyinterpreter, we may safely conclude that Joannapleaded her cause in that tongue, which she wrotewith ease ; for as her audience was so cosmopolitanand the effect of her eloquence was so immediate,she must have spoken a language understood byHad she addressedthem in either the Provencal or Italian language,all or most of her hearers.both of which she spoke with great fluency, onlyOnpart of her hearers would have understood.one occasion when Sancho, Prince of Castile, whohad to have an interpreter, was present at a RomanConsistory he heard loud applause, and asked hisinterpreter what was the meaning of it."

To prevent the spread of the infection, heestablished a special body of police ; he bought a fieldoutside the city as a burial-ground for the dead, andspent large sums of money on the transport thitherof the infected corpses, besides paying doctors toattend the poor and providing winding-sheets forthem.Avignon was at the time the plague brokeout full of visitors, many having come from theJoanna, which maycountry to pay homage toperhaps account for the enormous numbers—whichwere estimated in Avignon at one hundred andtwenty thousand—who are said to have perished ofthis terrible scourge.The disease was at its height during Lent, andduring the three last days of Holy Week fourteenhundred people are said to have died of it in theThe fact that it was worst during those dayswhen the Lenten fast was most strict shows thatcity.to live well was one of the best means of wardingoff an attack ; but at that time the Lenten fast wasvery much stricter than it is now, and dispensationsThe greatest number ofnot so easily granted.victims were among the women and children of thepoorest classes.The rich, however, were by no means exempt,and one of the Avignon victims was Laura, thebeloved of Petrarch, who died on April 6th afterthree days' illness.She had a presentiment that sheJoanna's Acquittal and its Results163would not live beyond three days after the fever setin, so she made her will and sent for a priest andreceived the Last Sacraments, and died with greatresignation, surrounded by friends and relations,whom not even the fear of the plague could keepaway from one they so loved and admired.She diedabout six o'clock in the morning of April 6th, andwas buriedthat same day after vespers, in thechapel attached to the monastery of the FranciscanFriars Minor.Petrarch, who was still madly in love with her,was at Verona at the time of her death, anxiouslyexpecting news of her ; but the plague had stoppedall communication with Avignon, as the courierswho carried the letters could not pass. He did notget the news of her death until May 9th, when hewas at Parma, and his grief, as may be imagined, wasintense. He passed several days without eating ordrinking, rendering himself, we should think, ex-ceedingly liable to an attack of the dread disease.He said of himself that " he dared not think ofhis condition, much less could he speak of it, andthat the loss convinced him that there was no longeranything worth living for; and since the strongestcord of his life was now broken, he should renouncethe world, where his cares had been deceitful andhis hopes vain and perishing."Before Petrarch had ceased to weep for Laura hisfriend Cardinal Colonna also died of the plague at164The Beautiful QueenAvignon, where his loss was greatly felt ; for hiscourt was a brilliant one, attended by literary menand men of genius from all parts of Europe.Butthe Italians who visited him could not bear Provenceafter their Maecenas, as they called him, was dead, andmost of them left the city of Avignon and returnedto Italy.Villani, the historian, was another victim to thisterrible pestilence, which had been predicted byBut he left an account of the beginningastrologers.of it, and among other things he tells us that themortality was greater in Pistoja and Prato than inFlorence, and greater in Bologna and Avignon andProvence and the whole kingdom of France, butgreatest in those countries beyond the sea amongthe Tartars.The Mendicant Friars came out splendidly duringthis calamity.

But Clement VI.with his usual clemency defended them in two Bullswhich he published, forbidding them to be forciblybaptised, under the severest penalties, as such wasthe alternative given to the Hebrews if they wishedto escape death.Another outcome of the fear and panic whichthe plague roused was the revival of the fanaticsknown as the Flagellants, who first appeared inthe eleventh century, and during the feuds of theGuelphs and Ghibellines they spread throughout1 66The Beautiful QueenFrance, Bohemia, Austria, Italy,Russia, Poland,and Hungary, but they did not appear in Englanduntil this second outburst of their fanaticism in 1348.They were penitents who went inprocessionthrough the various towns and cities to which theypenetrated, naked to the waist, and armed withscourges, with which they lashed themselves untilthe blood flowed, and marked their progress onthe ground.thefollowing year, but they have frequently made theirClement suppressed them inappearance since.It is computed that 100,000 victims perished ofthe plague in Venice, 60,000 in Florence, 1,200,000in Germany, and it is said that more than 200,000villages and small towns were left without anyWhile of the good Friars who workedinhabitants.so nobly to help the sick and dying, no less than124,434 died of this terrible disease.The cardinals and rich barons at Avignon shutthemselves up intheirpalaces, and burnt hugefires to keep away the infection ; and Clement VI.,who refused to go away from Avignon while it wasraging, also took this precaution of burning largefires and remaining indoors.The Great Pestilence, or the Black Death as it wasalso called, did not appear in England until Augustof this fatal year, 1348, and before it was extermin-ated it carried off" 5,000,000 victims during the yearit lasted.Joanna's Acquittal and its Results167Boccaccio, who had left Naples when the King ofHungary invaded it, went to Florence and therewrote his description of the ravages of this ghastlyscourge, which first of all began in the Far East.He tells us that inhis native city " no humanwisdom, no precautions, availed to avert the calamity.In vain by the orders of the magistrates were thestreets cleared of every impurity ;in vain werethe gates of the city closed against all infectedpersons, and the counsels of the most prudent putin practice for the preservation of health. Andequally unavailing were the humble supplications,not once but often made to God by devout persons,in solemn processions and other forms."His account is much too long to quote in full,but he describes some of the attendant horrors withgreat pathos, as when he says that in the panic" brother abandoned brother, the uncle his nephew,the sister her brother, the wife her husband, and,what is more surprising still and scarcely credible,fathers and mothers deserted their children as ifthey were children (sic) and feared to visit or servethem." Another horror he mentions was the sick beingthus deserted by neighbours, by friends, by relatives,so that no woman, however delicate or beautifulor noble, made any scruple to be served by a man,let him be who he might, old or young, from whichcause many who survived lost much of the modestyof their manners.68The Beautiful QueenThe plague had one good effect as far as Joannawas concerned : it frightened Louis of Hungary outof Naples, although it was not so bad there as inother parts of Italy, or as at Avignon and Provence.He, however, thought it better to remove the greatbody of his men to Apulia, to avoid the infectionin Naples, where its ravages were sufficiently serious.His retreat paved the way for Joanna's return,and about this time the news of her acquittal bythe Roman Consistory reached Naples, and a revul-sion of feeling towards their exiled Queen set inamongst the Neapolitans.With the exception of a few important men, whohad gone too far in encouraging the Hungariansto hope for forgiveness from Joanna, allnow united in earnestly desiring her return andTherestoration to the throne of her grandfather.nobility, who hated the haughty Hungarians andtheir insupportable yoke, resolved to throw it off;classesbut knowing this would be impossible without thehelp and support of their Queen, they sent secretmessengers to Avignon, begging hertoreturnand take up the reins of government again, andpromising if she would supply them with a fewmen and some money they would fight for herand do all in their power to reinstate her in herkingdom.At first Joanna was not inclined to agree to thisproposal, knowing that it would be no easy task toJoanna's Acquittal ' and its Results169get rid of the Hungarians ; but she laid the lettersbrought by the Neapolitan ambassadors before thePope and the Cardinals, who were only more certainof her innocence when they read them than theyhad been before. They counselled her to grant thepetition of her subjects as quickly as possible, andClement, anxious if possible to prevent more blood-shed, tried to restore her to her throne by diplomaticmeasures. To which end he sent an apostolic legateto Louis, Cardinal Guy of Boulogne, who was a relationof the Queen of Hungary, and was remarkable forhis gentle manners and persuasive powers of speech,by which the Pope hoped the King of Hungary mightbe persuaded to retire and leave the throne to Joanna.While the Cardinal was treating with Louis ofHungary in Naples, Joanna's staunch friend NicholasAcciajuoli was engaged in trying to raise men andmoney in order to wrest the kingdom from theinvader by force, if diplomacy failed to accomplishThe States of Provencethe reinstatement of Joanna.and Piedmont vied with each other in contributingto the expedition, but their combined efforts fell farshort of the required sum, and the Queen was re-duced not only to selling her famous diamonds, butall her other jewels, and finally to offering the city ofAvignon with the surrounding country to the Pope.Louis of Hungary, feeling sure that possession wasnine points of law, refused to listen to any of theproposals of the Cardinal of Boulogne for a peacefuli7°The Beautiful Queensettlement, so there was nothing for it, if Joanna wasto recover her kingdom, but to resort to arms.The sum the Queen asked for Avignon was80,000 golden florins. A gold florin was at thattime worth about a fifth of an ounce of gold, so thatthe price for which she sold it was equal to aboutThe Pope60,000 pounds sterling of our money.immediately paid this sum, which was used to defraythe cost of ten galleys fully equipped, and armedwith the men Acciajuoli had enlisted to relieve Naplesfrom the Hungarian yoke.Itissaidthat the Queen had succeeded inwinning the friendship of Clement so completely thathe would now do anything for her, and willinglyagreed to pay the sum she demanded for Avignon.He knew that Joanna earnestly desired the coronationof her husband, Louis of Taranto, as King of Naples,and that she wished for this almost as much as shewished for the restoration of her kingdom ; andwhen he gave her and Louis his parting blessinghe bestowed the coveted title upon him.Inconsequenceofthissalethe EmperorCharles IV. yielded to the Pope all the rights whichhe possessed over the town of Avignon, in themonth of November, 1348, at Gorpiet. The Latincontract, still in existence, states among other thingsthat Joanna sold Avignon with the consent of herhusband, Louis of Taranto.By thissale shesacrificed the lesser possessions of Avignon to regainJoanna's Acquittal and its Results171the throne of the Two Sicilies.The contract of salewas signed on June 19th, 1348, in the house atwhich Joanna was residing in Avignon at the time.Joanna remained about three weeks longer inthe plague-stricken city of Avignon after the sign-ing of the contract for its sale, and then, all theirpreparations being complete, she and Louis went toMarseilles and embarked there for Naples, full ofhope and elated with the knowledge that at any ratethe campaign would not be crippled for want ofmeans.They were returning under very different circum-stances from those under which they had left Naples.Then Joanna was suspected and openly accused ofthe murder of her first husband ; now she wasreturning with her character not only cleared, butwith the assurance of the Pope and Cardinals that shewas above suspicion, and was now under the specialfavour and protection of the Holy See— a valuedfriend of Clement VI., theidol of the gallantProvencal barons.Moreover, she was going backat the earnest invitation of her Neapolitan subjects,who were now only too ready to lay down their lives,if need be, to restore her to her throne.
