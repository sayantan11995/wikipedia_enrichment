CHAPTER IIJoanna's ChildhoodA MINOR mystery in the life of Joanna I.** why so wise a man as Robert the Goodshould have chosen Philippa the Catanese, whomhistorians speak of as " a woman sprung from theisdregs of the people, originally a laundress," as themost fitting person to have charge of the heiressto the Neapolitan throne.Whether Philippa wasworthy of the confidence reposed in her by the Kingand Queen or not, it was an unwise choice Philippa'slow origin afterwards reflected injuriously upon herroyal charge, and roused at the time the envy ofher contemporaries, who, prejudiced by the favourshown her, were ready to attribute every vice toJoanna's governess.Philippa was a native of Catania in Sicily, thewife of a Sicilian fisherman and herself a laundress,who was called in by Violante of Aragon to act aswet-nurse to her son Charles, the Duke of Calabria,'7281The Beautiful Queenwhen she was in Sicily with her husband, who wasengaged in an expeditionagainsttheSicilians.Philippa was not only beautiful and graceful, butintelligent also, and she soon acquired courtly man-ners, and took such tender care of her foster-sonthat Violante henceforth heaped honours upon her.Robert's seneschal, Raymond de Chabannes, had atthis time a favourite Moor who acted as his cookand steward, and pleased his master so well that hegave him his own names in baptism, and set himfree, and when he resigned the seneschalship recom-mended Robert to take the Moor in his place.Raymond the Moor soon became as great a favour-ite with the King as Philippa was with Violante, andwhen the Catanese's first husband died they arrangeda second marriage for Philippa with the new senes-chal, now raised to the rank of a knight.Before Violante died she begged Robert to begood to Philippa, and when he married Sancha,another Aragon princess, he gave Philippa to her asgrewof her.equally fondone of her ladies of the bed-chamber, and SanchaWhen the Dukeof Calabria, her foster-son, married Catherine ofAustria, Philippa was made first lady of the bed-chamber to her ; and when his second wife, Mariaof Valois, went with him to Florence, the Cataneseaccompanied her in the same office.The Angevine princes were celebrated for theirfidelity in rewarding the attachment of their subjects,Joanna's Childhood19in no matter how low a station, by bestowing uponthem high posts intheir household, which mayaccount for the affection and gratitude of so manyHerof the Neapolitan royal family to Philippa.contemporaries, with the credulity of their age, how-ever, attributed it to magic potions, in which theSicilian women were said to be very clever.Boccacciomade a much shrewder guess at the source of herinfluence, attributingitto her skill in makingcosmetics and confectionery.She succeeded in winning Joanna's affection also,and is believed to have lavished a mother's care uponher ; and when the young Queen came to the throneshe was the first lady in her court, and was treatedwith the greatest respect.It is impossible that Philippa could have risen toso high a position, from so lowly an origin, unlessshe had had great talent as well as personal gifts torecommend her, for she was a trusted servant ofRobert for forty-five years, and the devout QueenSancha had such regard for her that it was due toher influence that Joanna was placed under hercharge.Both Robert and Sancha must have had solidreasons for this choice, for we read in Carracciola'sLife of Joanna how particular they were in choosingThe King tookthe little Princess's attendants.special care that nothing should be said or done inthe child's presence from which she could learn evil,;20The Beautiful Queenand to that end he confided her to chaste matrons ;moreover, he took some nuns out of their convents,with the permission of the Pope, to instruct her inall Christian duties and in the religious ceremoniesat which she would have to assist, and to train herIndeed, so strictly did Robertin industrious habits.and Sancha bring their little grandchild up that theywould not allow any one to be seen in her companywho wore rouge or paint or the hair of any deadperson.It was a custom in the fourteenth century, whengross ignorance was the rule in all ranks of life, toentrust the education of royal princes and princessesto the religious orders, whose members were gene-rally more cultivated, and for this purpose, as in thecase of Joanna, nuns were permitted by dispensa-tion from the Pope to leave their enclosure andlive in the palace where their services were required.Thus it was quite in accordance with the spiritof the age for Robert to send for two nuns tocome to court, and try to form the character of thefuture Queen on religious principles, and it wasparticularly acceptable to Sancha.This unworldly Queen desired to leave the worldand join the Poor Clares, the strictest order of theChurch, for whom she had built a convent in Naplesand she was only deterred from taking this step byPope John XXII., who very wisely told her shewould be neglecting her duty as a wife if she didJoanna's Childhood21so, and thereby rendering herself displeasing toAlmighty" God, instead of her proposed sacrificebeing acceptable to Him. The pious Queen there-fore remained in the world until the death of herhusband.As Joanna grew older, still more elaborate ruleswere laid down by her grandfather with regard toher bringing up. None of those who dressed herwere to be of low birth, or unpolished manners ;her court was to be presided over by a man of thehighest prudence and authority, whom the noblesand their sons who frequented it would obey. Hewho gave the future Queen water for her hands attable, as was then the custom, must be a knight orgreater than a knight, and so must those who borethe dishes to her, and who tasted them to see thatthey were not poisoned before they were handed toher.

Asshe grew older her cultivated mind and her remark-able talents and great charm of manner, as well asher extraordinary beauty, which increased daily, madethe death of her father less grievous to the King, whosaw his granddaughter promised to make a goodqueen, and be a worthy successor to his throne.Unfortunately Robert's anxiety on Joanna's ac-count did not stop here. To make her successionstill more secure,as he thought, he arranged amarriage for her when she was only five yearsold, with Andrew, Prince of Hungary, the thirdson of Canrobert, King of Hungary.Robert is said to have acted on the advice of PopeJohn XXII., who desired thus to unite the opposingclaims of the two elder branches of the AngevineIn this matterfamily to the crown of Naples.;24The Beautiful QueenAs we saw in the last chapter, the eldest andHungarian branch of the Anjou line had never likedthe disposition of Charles the Lame, in leaving thethrone of the Two Sicilies to his second son, Robertand the Pope hoped a marriage with Canrobert'sthird son, Andrew, with the heiress to the Neapolitanthrone would prevent Canrobert and his heirs fromattempting to wrest the crown from the reigningbranch.Accordingly Robert arranged thisunfortunatemarriage between Andrew, then a little boy of seven,These child-marriagesand Joanna, a child of five.among royal families were not uncommon. A dis-pensation had to be obtained from the Pope, andsometimes, as in the case of Joanna's contemporaries,Magnus II. of Sweden and Blanche of Dampierre,the marriage was celebrated by proxy.It is trueMagnus was eighteen at the time of his marriage,but the little Belgian Princess Blanche was onlyThe great Queen Margaret of Sweden, theten.Semiramis of the North, as she was called, was onlyten when in 1363 she married Haquin and wasbrought tothe Swedish court to be educated.of feebleAnother of these child-marriages was that of PrinceJohn of Bohemia—he was like Andrew of Hungary,intellect—who when only nine yearsold was married in 1330, just three years beforeJoanna, to Margaret, daughter of Prince Henry,Margaret, who is knownCount and ruler of Tyrol.Joanna's Childhood;25to history as " Mucklemouthed Meg," was a fewyears older than her husband, and her marriageturned out more disastrous, if less tragic, than thatof Andrew and Joanna.Robert, however, determined that Andrew shouldcome to Naples, and, after the wedding of these twochildren had been celebrated there with all possiblepomp, decided that the young prince should remainat the Neapolitan court, and be educated there andsubjected to the influence of its culture, for theHungarians were at this time a semi-barbarian nation,By his attempt to conciliaterude and uneducated.the Hungarian branch of the Angevins with thisalliance, Robert disappointed the elder princes ofTaranto and Durazzo, both brave, talented youths,who hoped their uncle would bestow the hand ofthe heiress of the Two Sicilies upon one of them,or on one of their younger brothers, all of whomwere well known to Joanna, and constant frequentersof the Neapolitan court.It was unfortunate for every one concerned thatRobert's choice fell upon Andrew, whom he hadnot seen, instead of on one of the other attractiveThe boy was so young, when hecousins of Joanna.arrived in Naples to celebrate his marriage, that theKing could not possibly tell what time and educationmight do for him, or how his character would developbut he seems to have been almost, if not quite, imbecile.It was, however, too late to retract now, and Robert26The Beautiful Queenreceived the child-bridegroom and his father, Can-robert, the King of Hungary, with every sign of joy.Canrobert was attended by a number of Hungarianbarons, who were as astonished at the magnificence,culture, and refinement of the Neapolitan court asthe Neapolitan princes and nobles were at the bar-barian appearance and rude, uncultivated mannersof the Hungarians.This marriage, which was destined to turn outso disastrously, was celebrated withutmostpomp and splendour. The subsidiary courts oftheTaranto and Durazzo, with their princes, were allpresent as well as the Hungarians.Ambassadorsfrom all the other states and principalities of Italywere there, and among these the most numerousand the most gorgeously attired were the Florentines,whose staff bore the arms and wore the liveries ofthe Duke of Calabria, as though he were stilltheir ruler.This was considered the most delicatecompliment they could possibly have paid to hismemory.The Neapolitan nobility vied with the princesand members of the royal family in the splendourof their costumes in an age when extravagance indress was carried to an extent never since surpassedeither in costliness of material, brilliancy of colour,or absurdity in fashion.In all these particularsthe men equalled, if they did not surpass, theAmong other ridiculous fashions affectedwomen.Joanna's Childhood27by the younger men were theirclothing, one leg being clad in blue velvet andparti-colouredthe other in pink knee-breeches and silk stockings,or else one in green and the other in red brocadeddamask, or cloth-of-gold, while their shoes hadthe knee with a gold or silver chain.long points turned up at the toe and fastened toMen offashion all wore long hair hanging in ringlets overThe old men had long beards andtheir shoulders.long, flowing robes like Orientals.For a long time after this great function Floren-tine, Roman, Venetian, Sienese, and other Italianladies endeavoured to follow at their weddings,on a mitigated scale, the fashions set at Joanna's,which seems to have been the subject of court-gossip all over Europe.The infant-bride was resplendent in gold andpearls and other jewels ; and little did Robert think,as the two children—who, we are told, were delightedwith all this fuss and splendour—knelt before himfor his blessing, that they were both doomed to bethe subjects of violent and tragical deaths.At the end of October in this same year Can-robert went back to Hungary, leaving behind hima suite of Hungarians, with one Nicholas at theirhead as the governor of Andrew—who, by the way,was a mere nonentity—and one Friar Robert, inwhom was vested all authority over the young prince,as his tutor.28The Beautiful QueenThis is another instance of a member of a religiousUnfor-order being chosen as tutor to a prince.tunately Friar Robert, upon whom Italian historiansheap every kind of abuse—and even Petrarch canhardly speak of him without animosity—was notonly unsuitable for the office, but by his ambitionwas, to a large extent, responsible for the tragedyHe was a Franciscan friar, andwas evidently highly obnoxious to the Neapolitans,followed.thatbut whether he was really such a sink of iniquityas he is described by his contemporaries to havebeen may be doubted.He lived in an age when neglect of bodily cleanli-ness was considered a great mark of holiness, asit certainly is the greatest of all the bodily morti-fications practised by the saints, and there is nodoubt Friar Robert, from all accounts, gave con-vincing proofs of one meaning, and that not thehighest, attached to the " odour of sanctity."Thisis" attributed to him as hypocrisy, and Petrarch callshim "worse than a serpent," who is said to haveconcealed under his dirty habit vice and cruelty ;he is also accused of having wilfully brought upAndrew in ignorance, in order to gain a perniciousThis may or may notinfluence over his mind.be true.Andrew was apparendy so stupid,ifnot actually imbecile, that Friar Robert may havefound it impossible to impart any knowledge tohim.Joanna's Childhood29He certainly hated the Neapolitans as much asthey hated him, and he tried all he could to exalthispupilattheexpenseofJoanna, and theHungarians at the cost of the Neapolitans, but hedid not appear in his true character until after thedeath of King Robert.About a month after Joanna's marriage the cityof Florence was nearly destroyed by a most dis-astrous flood, which Villani, the historian, and someof the Florentines themselves, looked upon as ajudgment from HeavenKingRobert shared this opinion, and in a long Latintheirsins.forletter, which he as chief of the Guelphs wrote tothe citizens on this occasion, he exhorts them torepentance.The viewthatit was achastisement wasstrengthened by a vision seen on the night of thedeluge by a hermit who lived above the monasteryof Vallombrosa. He heard a terrific noise as he waspraying, and, going to the door of his hermitage,saw a troop of armed horsemen, all black andterribleinaspect,ridefuriouslypast, who, inanswer tohis questionas to where they weregoing, said they were going, please God, to drownthe city of Florence for its wickedness.Florence was at this time a very licentious city,and the scene of frequent bloodshed caused byencounters between the Guelphs and Ghibellines,the former of whom espoused the part of the Pope,30The Beautiful Queenthe latter the part of the Emperor ; they were alsocalled the Neri and Bianchi, as the followers of thePope's party and the King of Italy's are to this dayin Rome.During this century all the Italian republics andIn Romethe constant battles between the adherents of thecities were divided between rival factions.Colonnas and the Orsini, and the absence of thecontrolling power of a residential Pope, made theEternal City a prey to murder, assassination, andrapine, and unsafe to live in, for even the churcheswere in ruins.No incident of importance happened in Joanna'slife for five or six years after her early marriage.The child made such progress in her studies, andhad such excellent abilities, that by the time shewas twelve years old Costanzo and other writerssay of her " that she already surpassed in under-standing not only every child of her age, but manywomen of mature years."Moreover, by hergenerous and affectionate disposition and charmingmanners, she endeared herself to all around her.She was most obedient to Robert, whose heart wastorn with remorse when he saw his beautiful grand-child growing daily more accomplished and morefit to fill the high dignity in store for her, while,on the other hand, her semi-idiotic consort learnednothing from his Hungarian teachers except theirunpolished manners and the hatred they felt for theJoanna's Childhood31Neapolitans, with which Friar Robert endeavouredto inspire him.As the children grew up, the contrast becamemore striking between the beautiful Joanna andAndrew, who,unfortunateboorishandthePetrarch says, was " from all eternityugly andcontemptible."Joanna, as she entered her girlhood, is said to havebeen saddened at the terrible prospect of spending herlife yoked to so uncongenial a companion, especiallywhen she saw herself surrounded by many handsome,princes, her constant com-brave, and attractivepanions, who paid her homage, worshipped at hershrine, and would gladly have died for her, whowas one of the richest heiresses of her time, andendowed with extraordinary beauty as well as withsuch exceptional talents.Robert dimly foresaw some of the temptationsto which his own want of discretion would exposehis grandchild, and when Pope John XXII. died,and was succeeded in 1334 by Benedict XII., hemight have obtained a dispensation from the newPope to annul this infantine marriage, on the groundof Andrew's unfitness ; but, instead of doing this,he contented himself with calling a general assemblyof the nation, at which he caused the oaths ofallegiance to be taken to Joanna alone.This stepexcluded Andrew, orbarbarian followers, from any share in the govern-ambitious andratherhis3 2The Beautiful Queenment of the kingdom, and all Robert'sItaliansubjects joyfully took the oath of exclusive allegianceto the popular Joanna.Apart from all national jealousy, the Neapolitanshated the Hungarians on account of their drunken-ness and otherlow, coarse vices, and insolent,The Neapolitans were them-barbarian manners.selves by no means immaculate-—and indeed in thematter of licentiousness there was not much tochoose between them and the Hungarians.But theNeapolitans were sober and polished and refined inmanner, and of the careless, happy, joyous disposi-tion which still characterises them ; while the Hun-garians, in spite of their boorish inferiority, werehaughty and ambitious, and impudently aimed at gain-ing the ascendency in the kingdom for themselves.By this oath the political union between Andrewand Joanna was dissolved, but their marriage con-tract was still unfortunately religiously and civillybinding, in spite of their youth when it was made.King Robert, however, was to a great extentabsorbed in his books, for he remained a scholar tothe end of his days, and during the last year or two ofhis life was much taken up with Petrarch, whom hesucceeded in getting crowned with laurels at Rome,and induced to pay his first visit to the court of Naples,the year before Robert died—to see, as the poet said," the only King who could judge of anything moreimportant than a ragout or a flight of birds."
