CHAPTER  II.THE "model prison" AT PORT ARTHUR.I HE supreme disadvantage of travel in NewZealand is the necessity for so much of itbeing done in small steamers. No soonerhas the weary pilgrim recovered from the prostratingeffects of one voyage than another must be enteredWith a bravery borne of soul-harrowing experi-on.ences, and with a resolution worthy of any enterprise,I boarded the steamer for the southern port ; and atlast, after a repetition of familiar tribulations, wecame to anchor in the harbor of Lyttleton, on theeast coast of the South Island. The city is built inthe crater of an extinct volcano, which surrounds itwith high hills known as "The Seven Sleepers." Onthe summit of each hill, clear-cut against the bluesky, can be traced an outline resembling a person ina recumbent attitude. One of these outlines is so welldefined that it bears a striking semblance of the Dukeof Wellington, and has been so named.In thisneighborhood lies the quiet, sleepy Port of ChristChurch, which is passed on the way to Dunedin, themost interesting journey by rail on either island.As we left the mountains, there was unfolded toour gaze a great fertile valley, extending into the fardistance, and beyond it a range of lofty mountains,rugged and seamed by time and the ceaseless action88NE W ZEALAND AND TASMANIA.This sheltering range protects theof the elements.smiling valley at its foot from the hot and witheringwinds of summer, and the blighting chill of winter.The scene throughout the day was a continuance ofvalley-land which bore every aspect of a prosperous,happy farm life, so softened by the touch of naturethat it brought all things to a complete harmoniouswhole.

The town is reachedin a few hours by boat from Hobart ; the trip givesone a very good idea of the general coast-line, andPort Arthur itself is still attractive. To my mind theobject of greatest interest was the old man who hadbeen banished from England for life for stealing somecandy from a counter in a bakery to which he hadAt the time of my visit he wasbeen sent for bread.very old, and had formed such an attachment for theplace that he could not be tempted to leave it.

The building was made of heavystone, quarried near by, and was so well built that theyears have left no trace upon it. The whipping-post,a heavy iron pillar, still stands ; and if it could speak,the very air would, doubtless, become laden with thegroans of the suffering. The recreation ground wasa small yard surrounded by high walls ; to this theprisoners were driven out every day and allowed somany " rounds," twenty rounds making a mile.When it was necessary to inflict extra punishmentthe criminal was marched into a dark cell and kepton bread and water served but once a day.I enteredthis cell, whose very walls might well cry out inprotest against the wrongs perpetrated in the name ofFour great iron doors, double bolted, barredjustice.and locked, shut in the helpless and hopeless victim.Ventilation was not a consideration, for to admit airwas to give light, and this vile den was intendedto exclude every glimmer of day. The blacknesswas awful beyond description.Into this chamber of94NE W ZEALAND AND TASMANIA.horrors were thrust men and women who in any pos-sible way had rebelled against their conditions.This direful institution was called the "prison ofsilence," and was used in punishment of a variety ofCriminals were sent there to be disciplinedoflfenses.only, and while within the walls were not allowed toutter a sound ; neither were they given any occupa-tion ; their lot was to sit in silence for days or weeks.The utterance of a single word meant either the darkroom or the whipping-post.I was surprised when the old convict to whom Ihave alluded took us to a large room and said, "Thisis the chapel where they preached to us on Sundaysand told us what miserable wretches we were." Theroom was of circular form, and the pews were fear-fully and wonderfully made ; they extended aroundthe room from a door on the right to a door on theleft, and were so constructed that the "worshipers"These pews were incould see the preacher only.reality only stalls large enough to seat one prisoner ;the distance between the rows was about two feet,and the benches were partitioned oflf at regular inter-vals with small doors that swung either way.
