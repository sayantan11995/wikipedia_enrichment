CHAPTER  IV.THE LORD OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT.I HE ruler of Siam, Prow Chula Chum Clowby name, is a most intelligent man whospeaks three different languages and hasquite a knowledge of the outside world. The presentking is the first ruler who ever left his domain.Some time ago he paid a visit to Singapore, and thecitizens of that town erected a statue of an elephantin the public square in commemoration of his visit.The king is more progressive than the previous rulers,but he is slow to bring changes to his people or adoptnew methods. With few exceptions the same usagesprevail that have been handed down through the cen-Some small changes have been made, butturies.nothing that indicates a spirit of real progress.Ithas ever been an unwritten law that the royal familymust marry royalty. As they have been largely shut,up to themselves, and have had, practically, no deal-ings with the outside world, the lack of opportunityhas prevented them from intermarrying in the royaltyof surrounding countries, after the European fashion.Because of this the king's choice in marriage is lim-ited to a selection from his own family. The lateking, like the present one, had many wives and chil-dren ; from the children of his father the present kingSIAM.191chose his wife. They are hah' brother and sister, bothThechildren of the late ruler by different wives.recognized royal children are those of the queen only,who occupies the palace with the king.These chil-dren are five in number, and the oldest has been pro-Besides these the king is theclaimed heir-apparent.In his harem ithappy father of forty other children.is said there are fifteen hundred women who are allof more or less noble birth, for only the noble mayventure to send their daughters to the king. Thehighest possible honor that can be bestowed upon aman is the addition of his sweet young daughter tothe hundreds of women who live within the palacegrounds.The king lives in great state in a very large palace.The building is of white stone, two or three storieshigh, and of modern architecture. The great stepsare guarded by two immense elephants, built of brickand mortar and covered with gold leaf. When theking leaves the palace he is accompanied by all thepomp usual among more enlightened rulers.Hisstables are the finest in Asia. He scorns the littleIndian pony, and his horses are brought from thecountry that produces the king of horse-flesh—Aus-His charger is black as coal, with fiery eyes,tralia.and is an "up-to-date" high-stepper.Besides thisfine array of some hundreds of thoroughbred horses,the king dotes on his three white elephants.Theseare seldom used ; they are regarded as sacred. Theelephants are carefully cared for by attendants, and(quarters have been biiilt for their special comfort, each192SIAM.In the center of the roomhaving a large, airy room.a heavy pillar is decorated with a canopy of showydrapery, under which the vicious creature paws, aimsineflfective blows at his innocent keeper, and other-wise displays to the looker-on his appreciation of thecare bestowed upon him.The day was appointed on which I was to feast myeyes upon the visage of a real live king.I had littlefear, for I had passed through a similar experience, andhad come off with my life.It is the custom to appearbefore his majesty in full dress ; that is, in some kindI was traveling atof light dress, with gloves, etc.the time with no other baggage than a valise, inwhich limited space I could not stow away a wholedry-goods store ; so in matters of dress I had reallysmall choice. The garment settled upon was draggedforth into the sunlight for an airing, and next day Iwas on my way to the palace. A long row in a smallboat on a sweltering day, with my clothes clingingcloser than glue, and my front hair drooping—infact, almost dripping—were the penalties of going tosee the king.I reached the outer walls of the grounds, wheretwo noblemen met me and escorted me to the corridorThere I met the high and mighty ofof the palace.the land, waiting to perform the arduous task of pre-senting me to the king. A number of foreign repre-sentatives were expecting to be received, and thesewere also present in the elegant corridor, where wewere served with refreshments while waiting.Pres-ently a message came from the king, through th?SIAM.193prince, his eldest brother, that his majesty was pre-pared to receive me. The prince was to escort me tothe audience-room and present me. He ofifered hisarm and conducted me to a long hall, on each side ofwhich stood armed soldiers ; this led to the privateGreat bronzed doorsaudience-room of the king.opened as we approached, and when I entered theking walked half way across the room to greet me,which was really done in a most democratic way ; hethen motioned me to a seat near by.The king speaks English, but never to a foreignerI, of course, spoke my own language,in the palace.which he understood perfectly, though he carried hispart of "the conversation in Siamese, and his olderbrother interpreted. He was thoroughly informed onthe latest phases of the woman question, and seemedto know of all the eflForts that were being put forth bythem for their own elevation and the betterment of theworld. When I spoke to him of the education of hisown women, many of whom had never attendedschool, he was of the opinion that the time had notyet come for general education among the Siamese.His argument was clever, considered ex parte. Hefirst touched upon a thought that has awakenedwide-spread interest in connection with the highereducation of women ; namely, will it unfit them forthe peculiar conditions that surround them ?In' With educationspeaking of this the king said :there always comes culture and refinement. TheIf they becomepeople of this country are very poor.cultured and refined, they will- naturally want things194SIAM.about them more beautiful than those they have beenaccustomed to, and this education will bring with ita spirit of discontent."There may be something in the king's argument,but I am of the opinion that he is fully aware of onefact : If the women of Siam ever become educated hecan never build walls high enough to keep fifteenhundred women in his harem.After an hour of pleasant conversation, duringwhich I gathered his majesty's ideas on many localand foreign subjects, I left the palace with a guidewho was under instructions to show me around thebuilding and grounds.JAVA AND BURMAH.
