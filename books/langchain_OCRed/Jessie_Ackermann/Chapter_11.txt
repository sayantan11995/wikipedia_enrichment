CHAPTER  III.woman's education in japan.IOST oriental countries boast of their culture,but education is chiefly confined to the maleportion of the population. Women, withbut few exceptions—few as compared with the masses—are denied the first rudiments of learning.This isnot so true of the women of Japan.Boys and girlsalike are sent to primary schools, and since the adventof missionaries special attention has been given to theeducation of girls, and the higher education of womanis an oft-discussed subject. Many of them aspire toprofessions, and not a few are engaged in literary pur-In Tokio I was " interviewed " by a lady re-suits.porter, who was one of the staff of a daily paperOne of the best temperanceconducted by a woman.magazines of our day is edited and owned by a Japa-nese woman.While in Tokio I addressed the "Society for theHigher Education of Woman." The meeting washeld in the school established by the government fornoblemen's daughters ; for the government has awak-ened to the fact that the advancement of a countrydepends largely on the development and education ofits women. The embassadors to America, Englandand France are obliged to take their wives with them,?i8JAPAN.119the government having issued the following order:"Our women are all backward in intelligence forwant of sound education, and the education of thechildren goes hand in hand with that of the mothers,and is an object of highest importance ; therefore, wedesire the embassadors to take with them their wives,daughters and sisters, that they may learn in foreignlands the correct system of instructing children."The meeting to which I refer was attended by abouttwo hundred peeresses.After the address an oppor-tunity was given to ask questions, and it was surpris-ing to see how alive they were to all that pertains tothe advancement of women. They recognized thefact that the true elevation of the country dependedon their own improvement. No nation can move onand leave its women behind ; it can only progress aswomen keep abreast with the age.Several younggirls of rank have been sent by the empress to theUnited States that they may have the advantage ofour best schools.Their capacity for advanced mentaltraining has been fully established by their highstanding in their classes, and the fact that several ofthem have carried off first prizes in competition withAmerican girls of their own age.This will doubtlesslead to placing girls throughout the empire on anequal footing with boys in educational privileges.Following this must soon come the legal recognitionof women.Education in Japan has taken a remarkable formamong some of the better classes of women.Thepeople are very fond of assembling to listen to pro-I20JAPAN.fessional singers and readers.
