The natives appearedto be—and in fact are— a mixture of every race ; theyhave intermarried until now they belong to no reallydistinct family, and are without distinguishing charac-teristics.

Through the kindness of the mayor263264AFRICA.it was arranged that I should reach the summit, andat the same time save my strength and shoe leather.On the top of the mountain a great reservoir was incourse of construction, and to carry material to the topserial cable lines had been put up.These consistedof heavy wire ropes, extending from the apex of themountain to its foot ; an engine at each end kept theOver these wires ran pulleys, tocable in motion.which baskets were attached, and in one of these wewere to ascend three thousand five hundred feet.The manager of the works and another gentlemanwere to accompany me.A long and delightful drive around the foot of themountain brought us to the side facing the sea, wherethe engine house stands, from which point we were tostart. The perpendicular walls of the vast hill rosebefore us, and the undertaking seemed most perilous.We crowded ourselves into the basket, the signal wasgiven, and we moved slowly over the wire, suspendedI looked below, and saw the shadow growin mid-air.less and less till it seemed scarcely the size of myAs we neared the face of the rock we hung athand.rest for a few minutes until a workman gathered usup, and we were landed on the top.There were afine view, wonderful works, and hundreds of men tobe seen ; and even a nice house—the home of themanager—where we rested and partook of his hospi-But, truth to tell, I was thinking about thetality.getting down again, and I confess I did not like theidea, especially when the gentleman who was with ussaid, " I would give anything if this trip were over."AFRICA.265When the time for the descent arrived, I walked to theedge of the summit, seated myself in the basket, andtook courage for the down trip, which was accom-plished in a few minutes ; and then I, too, was ableto say, " I have been to the top of Table Mountain."Just out of Cape Town a few miles is one of GeneralBy kind invitation of the overseerBooth's colonies.I drove out to see what was being done to elevate asmall portion of the " submerged tenth," in whoseThereinterests the General has so bravely worked.is no doubt that if the poverty-stricken of the greatcities could be brought to such places, and surroundedby similar influences, there would soon stand forth amighty host for whose bettered condition they wouldforever bless General Booth.

He waspossessed of a great desire to tread unknown parts' to step on sod never pressed by the foot of thewhite man !" To this end he made preparation for anextended trip to distant parts, taking with him sev-eral natives and camping out.After long days andweary nights of travel he reached a lonely, forsakenspot on a hillside, and there pitched his tent, believ-ing he was far out of the track of his kind. A largefire was kindled without the tent, and the lone min-strel sat him down to pick the jews-harp.His soulreveled in the delight that from that spot no white268AFRICA.face had ever looked into the starry firmament, noeager soul had feasted on the wild beauty—this alonewas left for him; and with a satisfaction born of greatThe next morning heachievement he fell asleep.betook himself to a cool seat under the long, feathery,drooping limbs of a tropical tree to revel in solitude.A native, following with a fur rug and a camp-stoolfor the comfort of his master, found an empty sardinebox and a whisky bottle, which he tossed to oneside, and they fell almost at the feet of the Belgian.The latter's disappointment was almost greater thanWith uplifted eyes and extendedhe could bear.arms he exclaimed, "Great heaven! the Scotchmanhas been here before me !'

The driver jumped lightly to the box, gath-ered up the reins, and before I knew it the mettlesomesteeds were speeding on their way.The coach was filled with passengers, outside asThis gave it the appearance of being top-well as in.heavy ; and as we swayed from side to side we werein constant fear that those of us on the top would beleft by the wayside. The careless, almost reckless,manner of the driver was in no way calculated toinspire confidence, and my only thought was, "Howawful it will be when night comes on."Night came.

The barren wastes of the deserthad given way to tropical foliage ; and the moaningwind was lost in the fresh sea air that blew softlyover the land, subduing the clouds of dust that untilthen had continuously enveloped us.Continuing the journey southward we came toQueenstown, where we saw the first real native vil-lage, some two or three miles from the city.Thiswas inhabited by Kaffirs, who received us with greathospitality, showing us through their houses, andgiving us any desired information. The Kaffirs are ofa somewhat lower order of intellect than that I had ex-pected to find ; and to educate and evangelize them is,in my opinion, an almost hopeless task, though themissionaries report great progress in this direction.In these parts the natives are not so black as arethe negroes of the United States, but they are muchless intellectual in appearance. The men wear onlya blanket wrapped around them ; no matter howhot the sun, or cold the wind, this ever abides withIn some way these blankets are dyed a deepthem.terra-cotta color, and one blanket serves the wearerfor years. From appearance, I should say some ofthem had been handed down for several generations.The men are lazy, and their highest ambition is topossess themselves of a certain number of cattle ;AFRICA.271with these they are able to purchase a number ofIn increasing his wives the Kafl&r increaseswives.his stock in trade, for the women perform all the hardlabor.
