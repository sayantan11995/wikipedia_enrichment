CHAPTER  11.QUEER WAYS OF SHOWING GRIEF IN CHINA.FIRST witnessed a Chinese funeral in thestreets of Victoria, on the island of HongKong. As I passed along a strange noiseattracted my attention, and looking in the directionwhence it came I saw a large moving crowd, andresolved to see what it might mean.I retreatedfrom the street to the steps of a native shop, andthere awaited the advancing throng, which provedto be a Chinese funeral. A long procession, madeup of strange-looking people, was headed by smallboys carrying wooden signs, or banners.These wereinscribed with those fiendish hieroglyphics, with in-numerable horns and hoofs, that give one the impres-sion that the language is of a warmer climate thanThese banners were carried far abovethat of China.the heads of the bearers, and the inscriptions were sup-Followingposed to recount the virtues of the dead.the mourners, wailers filed in line, for this was theNumbers were hiredfuneral of a well-to-do person.to wail and cry ; ten or a dozen were dressed in white,with cone-shaped covers made of white calico on theirheads ; these covers drooped far over the face, com-pletely concealing the features.

Asthej' marched they swayed their bodies to and fro,and howled, and moaned, and sobbed ; the one whomade the most noise was accounted the best mourner,and probably received the largest amount for hisservices. Behind the mourners the pall- bearers slowlymarched, as if trying to keep step with the loudwails. The cojB&n was large, and looked heavy.Itwas flat on the bottom, oval at the sides, with acurved lid, and a heavy piece extending upward fromone end, which marked the head, for it was the samewidth all the way down.Large ropes were boundabout it and the ends were made fast to a piece ofbamboo, which was placed over the shoulders of themen, leaving the cofl&n to wobble about as theymarched along.The thought of a bier has never occurred to thesepeople, for it is not in the nature of a Chinaman toBehind the coffin fol-devise labor-saving methods.lowed bearers of sweets and meats to be placed onthe grave of the departed and consumed at his leis-ure. A pyramid-shaped tier of shelves were ladenedwith food of all kinds, including a whole roast pig,-fowls, ducks, and many savory bits seldom tastedin the life of an ordinary Chinaman. The runningand hurrying of some parts of the procession as theyoccasionally became detached from the other by rea-son of the large crowds, the endless din of the noisethey called "music," mingled with the sound ofORIENTAL OBSEQUIES,309wailing voices, made a scene of confusion not easilydescribed and never to be forgotten.The selection of a place of burial is the chief con-cern of the relatives, for much of the future staTie ofhappiness depends upon where the bones oftheFrequently days elapse before andeparted rest.auspicious spot -away from the range of the windwhich blows " bad luck,"— can be settled on.

The coffin was carried in the man-ner described, but there was no procession beyond therelatives, and no extra mourners. The coffin hadpassed before I caught sight of it, but my attentionwas arrested by a number of weeping persons ridingon wheelbarrows.I called a coolie and followed upthe procession of six wheelbarrows, on which wereseated nine weeping women and three men.Itnever dawned upon me that it might be a funeral.Wheelbarrow travel, which is the usual mode in these3IOORIENTAL OBSEQUIES.parts, was unique, and the thought of being wheeledto a funeral in one of those unsightly conveyancesovercame the solemnity that the occasion demanded,and 1 confess I overtook that funeral procession ina frame of mind unfit to offer my services as oneThe mourners were chieflyof the hired wallers.women, and, being of the poorer class, could notafford the expense of white garments for mourningapparel ; so their grief was indicated by a strip ofwhite muslin bound about the head, with the endsThe grief they failed to ex-left dangling down.press by way of garb was made up in noise, asthey threw themselves from side to side, with manyhairbreadth escapes from landing in the road.

As I satperched upon a saw-horse, a common seat among thepoor, I saw a very rude coffin against the wall on theopposite side of the room. When the crowds of menand women pushed in, several seated themselves uponthe coffin, and almost sat upon each other as theyORIENTAL OBSEQUIES.313tried to make room for one more. The thought cameto me that probably they had purchased it at "a bar-gain," and were keeping it in readiness, thinking, atthe same time, that it would serve as a warning ofour "common end" ; but it was only my Yankeeproclivities that led me to such conjectures.It wasthe custom in those parts whenever the husband orthe wife died, to embalm the remains and keep thecoflSn in the house until the death of the other, and,The husband of thisfinally, bury them together.family had been dead seven years, and the coffin hadbeen in the house all the time !Before leaving the town I returned to say a lastword to the woman, thank her for her kindness, andleave a copy of the Bible in her language.I did notenter, but stood in the doorway a sufficient time tomake mental notes of the scene before me. On thecoffin sat a young child eating rice from a bowl withits hands. An old hen and her brood of chicks hadcome into the house (a way they have in that coun-try), and, being on familiar terms with the child, hadhopped up on the coffin and helped herself to amouthful of rice, which she threw to the floor insmall particles, and, in hen language, called the littleones to partake of the feast.

Many regard the process of burningas the highest expression of all heartlessness. Wecome to have almost a reverence for these shells ofORIENTAL OBSEQUIES.315ours, made up of perishable matter.

As we become more enlight-ened we shall also learn that it is possible to burnour dead with the same reverence and respect as thatwith which we now consign them to the ravages ofthe worms of the dust, knowing that in all proba-bility future generations (when the burial-places ofto-day are lost to sight) will subsist upon the vege-tation nourished by moldering ancestors.Aside fromthe question of health, cremation would be a perfectboon to that portion of humanity who are so consti-tuted that they must visit the graves of their dearones in order to express their heart's sorrow.Iwould just as soon think of weeping over the spotwhere the cast-off garments of the dead were buriedas to go to the cemetery, and in anguish of soullinger beside the spot where the worn-out, cast-offgarment of a personality has been buried.
