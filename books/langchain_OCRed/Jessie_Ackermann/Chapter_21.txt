CHAPTER  I.THE GRAND TEMPLE OP JAVA.|T THE present rate of " globe trotting " thepress of time is so great that very few findleisure to depart from the beaten paths oftravel, and consequently some of the places of great-est interest are missed ; but when one starts with six,seven or more years before him, many byways andside-tracks lead the pilgrim to spots almost unknown.Among these, is* the island of Java, and it is wellworth the traveler's while to spend an extra month,if need be, to reach the center of that country andsee what should be classed among the wonders ofthe world.Were Java under the rule of any but the sleepyHollanders—who are still more sleepy for their so-journ there—the center of the island would long agohave been made more accessible, and the peoplebrought in closer contact with the outside world.But when Holland, after the manner of other coun-land, pensioned thetries, took unto herself thisrulers, set aside all native rights, and appropriated196JAVA AND BURMAH.the labor of the natives to cultivate and make richthe soil, she lost sight of all things save the enrich-ment of her treasury, and the bestowal of 'ofl&ces " upon a few favored individuals.' fatIn the way of vegetation Java contains all that weimagine as belonging to Eden—palms of all kinds,breadfruit, cocoanut, and scores of other tropicaltrees, as well as spice-plants and fruits, and a generalgrowth more luxuriant of foliage and graceful ofform than that found anywhere in the western world.These trees form the home of birds of gorgeous plum-age, and fireflies and insects that look like flyinggems as they move about in their glory of color.Isaw there more than the poet has dreamed of, orpainter ever depicted, for nature far outrivals theskill of man. On one side I caught glimpses ofpretty little valleys clothed in eternal summer ; onthe other, lofty mountain peaks crowned with fleecyclouds.At the Batavia postofiice I read in English, "Thegrand temple in the interior of Java, that for archi-tectural design, decorations, carvings and finish isworthy of Greece itself, testifies to a cultivation of thenatives that has long since died out."It did nottake me long to make up my mind to make the tripto the interior, not only that I might gaze upon thistriumph of architectural skill, but that I might alsosee the ruins to be passed on the way.In looking upon the ruins time has wrought, itseems wonderful how nature reclaims and drawsagain within the earth all that has been taken outJAVA AND BURMAH.199Seeds are dropped by birds, or blown by theof it.wind between the joints of stone ; moistened by therains and fed by the dust, they germinate, spreadtheir roots, force even the mighty stones asunder andthrow them to the ground whence they were dug.Everywhere in Java the destroying vegetation isthrowing down, feeding upon and covering up ruinsthat, for want of a little care, will soon be lost tosight.The journey to the temple is two hundred milesby slow rail, with all the annoyances experienced inthat hot clime,—dust flying, perspiration oozing fromevery pore in the body, and clothes a burden almostunendurable. The two hundred miles covered, thereally difficult part of the journey began by stage.The six little horses were changed every few miles,and even then I felt that a humane society shouldhave had charge of the whole party ; but we rode,struggled and walked until we reached our journey'send, where I sat down to refresh myself on the cocoa-nuts brought by one of the coolies.If the distancehad been twice as long, and the difficulties even morenumerous, I would have felt that the stupendoussight before me was sufficient requital for all the dis-comfort. The legend given by the natives describesthe temple and its construction better than I couldbring it before the reader.Two thousand years ago, the natives decided toerect a great temple worthy of their country and relig-ion. A site was first selected in the interior of theisland, on a gently sloping hill, where a structure that200JA VA AND BURMAH.would abide all time should stand. A plan was thencalled for, and the scores submitted must have out-numbered the glory-seeking aspirants to honor whowould have figured in architectural fame at theIn that country where the commonWorld's Fair.people have no political rights, but where the highplaces are held by right of birth, it is a strangething that the plan of this temple should have beensubmitted to a popular vote, and thus decided.

One massivestone after another was dug from the quarry, andunder the skillful hand of the sculptor was convertedinto a thing of beauty, and sent to fill its place in thepile that was to form the temple. The time camewhen the last figure stood out in all its beauty uponthe last block ; the cap-stone had been polished withcare, and all was in readiness to pile the stones oneupon another, a task which was to be completed inOne hundred thousand workmen camethree days.from all parts of the island, ready to complete thework ; a national holiday was proclaimed, and twomillion pilgrims came to see the structure reared.I stood on a great knoll, and as I viewed the land-scape on all sides, the scenes of that distant timecame clearly before me.For three days rose thistemple of Boer Buddha, without the sound of ham-Javanese Child.Javanese Fruit Woman.203JAVA AND BURMAH.mer—as mute as are the workings of nature.
