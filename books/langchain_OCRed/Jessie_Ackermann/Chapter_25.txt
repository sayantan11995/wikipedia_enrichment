CHAPTER  I.TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.HUNDRED and fifty thousand miles oftravel by land and sea aflfords great scopeIf one werefor a diversity of experiences.to ask me where I had had the greater variety—onland or sea— I would be unable to say, for both havebrought such varied experiences that at times thetears would unbidden start, and again I would bealmost convulsed with laughter.Occasionally, terror,also, has had almost complete possession of me.I believe the most remarkable experience in allmy journeys occurred at sea.I had been travelingthrough the Australasian colonies, and was on myway to India.There is little traffic up that coast,and the steamers are anything but first-class—simplycargo-boats, with passenger cabins. We started fromFreemantle, on the west coast. The passengers werefew in number ; six traveling men, one minister, aFrench catholic priest and myself made up the list.The whole coast is a wilderness of sand-hills. As faras the eye can reach no sign of vegetation is to be223224INDIA.seen save a growth of wild flowers ; these belong tothe everlasting family, are of every hue and shade,and, strangely enough, take root in the burning sand,among the rocks, and on the barren hillsides. Atthis time not a drop of rain had fallen in two years.The sheep and cattle lay dead on the plains by thou-sands, and the few remaining inhabitants were sickat heart and discouraged.On this coast are some of the greatest pearl fish-Just out at sea, anchored in theeries in the world.shallow waters, was a fleet of about one hundred andfifty small boats, manned by twelve or fifteen hundredmen of many nationalities ; some were from the StraitSettlements, and others from Japan and the North.Our steamer remained here for two days.It is thecustom when a steamer calls at this port for the offi-cers of the pearling fleet to come on board and dineI chanced to sit near one of thewith the captain.officers. He described the manner of going down tothe bottom of the sea, and concluded by asking,"Why don't you go down?" He uttered this in atone that indicated a challenge, and at the same timeseemed to say, " You dare not go."When I remembered how tall I was, the thoughtcame to me, " Surely, they will never have clothes" so I replied, " Yes, I will go,large enough for me ;if you have a suit that will fit me." The captainbecame so excited that he at once left the dinner-table, took a skiff", rode over to a pearling- boat, andin a few moments returned to say that everything wasin readiness. To retreat would be unworthy of myINDIA.225country, so with trembling limbs and almost batedbreath, I started, in company with the stewardessHere the stew-and captain, for the pearling-boat.ardess helped me prepare for the dive. Two suits ofheavy knit wear were soon donned ; then came theoutside garment that covered the whole body, all butthe hands and head ; a metal hoop was placed aroundmy neck ; on this were a number of screws overwhich the neck of the dress was pulled ; then came aman with a wrench and made fast each screw. Theshoes were next brought out ; they weighed thirty-two pounds.

To the helmet was attachedone end of a rubber hose, the other end leading tothe air-pump, and arrangements were completed whenI put on the weights (forty pounds of lead) about myneck and shoulders.Thus attired, it was impossible to move, but anumber of gentlemen from our steamer, with the gal-lantry that characterizes their sex throughout theworld, offered to put me overboard.It took aboutten men to carry me to the side of the ship, and Iwas thrown overboard—yes, thrown overboard !Ilanded on my back, and in a few moments, throughthe glass of the helmet, I saw those ponderous shoes2 26INDIA.begin to come up, and I knew I was going down headI pulled the signal, and was soon taken onI was thenfirst.deck, where the surplus air was let out.lowered to the bed of the ocean.The sensation is very much the same as that expe-It was justrienced in the descent in an elevator.after a wild storm, and the disturbed condition of thewater made the occasion not very favorable for sight-I found the bottom hard and sandy.
