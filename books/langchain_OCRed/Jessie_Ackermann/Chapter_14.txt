No steamers sail the small rivers, andthe only means of travel is either in a small privatehouse-boat, or in one of the public traffic boats thatcarry the natives from place to place. To travel inthe latter entails more or less exposure to disease, forthe lower classes have every appearance of deadly mal-adies lurking about them. Many of them are afflictedwith leprosy, making them loathsome to behold.They go about uncared for, and are left to mingle withthe masses, thus spreading the disease and endanger-ing the safety of the traveler.Crossing a river in anative boat I have found myself surrounded by lepersin almost every stage of life (or death), yet still ableto move about from place to place, veritable walking"pest-houses." When the disease has reached an—142CHINA.advanced stage they are awful to behold. The eatingaway of the various features so disfigures them thatthey bear little resemblance to a human being.To avoid contact with these unfortunates I traveledThis was a novel experience.in a small house-boat.As we loosed the little boat we were to live in for anuncertain time, and drifted down the bay with thetide, a strange sensation came upon me, and I closedmy eyes to mentally peer into the regions beyond,only to feel confused and bewildered as to what wemight encounter. The boat had three apartmentsthe sleeping room, which also served as sitting anddining room ; the kitchen, a small space six by fourfeet, just large enough for a Chinaman to display hisskill in the preparation of food ; and a small room inwhich the Bible-woman slept on the floor, after theBesides the cook and Bible-woman,native custom.the ship was manned by seven native sailors, whorowed when it was calm weather, and spread the sailswhen we were favored with a breeze. We were be-calmed much of the time.The weather was hot anddamp, for we were in one of those humid climateswhere everything mildews. A tin box, elevated afew inches from the floor, stands in every room, andin this, on retiring, you deposit the garments wornIf you carelessly leave shoes orduring the day.books out at night, in the morning they are coveredwith heavy mildew ; and to hang a garment againstthe wall necessitates great labor in drying before itcan be worn or packed away.After a bath at night,when the vapor almost to the extent of steam roseCHINA.143from the body, I had serious misgivings as to the con-dition in which I might be found next morning, and' of mould and mildew made wretched' shades 'the 'my sleepless hours.A calm beset us the first night, and taking advan-tage of the absence of the sun, the men bent to theiroars and toiled all through the hours of darkness.Daybreak brought us to the mouth of the river, upwhich we turned, and encountering the favoring tide,we drifted with little labor to the sailors. The airwas laden with a salt sea dampness, which causedevery garment to lay hold of the body with a clingingembrace from which it was impossible to free one's self;but as it ever is in life, the eternal law of compensa-tion came into full force, and our thoughts were soonturned to the beauty of the country.China, in some parts, affords a variety and grand-eur of scenery little imagined until the inner regionsAlong the Foo Chow river, the trav-are penetrated.eler finds himself amid the boldest, most strikingmountain scenery through which any known riversweeps its course ; but the Kitie, the stream up whichour house-boat slowly sailed, wends its curling waythrough the lowlands. The banks are dotted withwalled villages, and the whole valley, hemmed in bydistant mountains, is covered with rice and sugar-canefields, amid which can be seen the temples, guilds,and pagodas that form the characteristics of this partof the world.The appearance of a foreigner in one of these in-So small a per cent ofland towns is truly an event.;144CHINA.the people read or know anything of the outsideworld that the advent of a white face among themcreates wide-spread interest, and not a little confu-sion.

What was I to do ?No manner of dress could decrease the two yardsI put onof humanity that would confront them.my gloves, to avoid contagion from lepers, tookofif my sun-bonnet, in which I had traveled, andMiss Ackermann in Oriental Costume,CHINA.147with the lady missionary and Bible-woman venturedinto the crowd. When the children saw how I loomedabove the rest they set up a shout, the men chatteredaway among themselves, the women came nearer toexamine my wearing apparel, and numerous were thequestions put to us. The missionary who accom-panied me could speak the language, and explainedthe object of our visit, telling them that we had heardmuch of them and their country, and had come to seewhat they were like. They seemed quite satisfied,and we returned to our boats amid many exclama-' How beautiful they are ! Howtions, such as 'deadly white ! Where did they come from ?' Thelast words the Bible- woman heard were, "That bigone must be a man." The crowd finally disbursedand we were left to the quietude of the night.'With the break of day, crowds again gatheredabout the boat, and when we started for the city itwas with the greatest difficulty that we were able toit was impossible to movereach the narrow streets ;in any direction only as we were borne by the crowds.Their curiosity gave vent to the wildest chatter, andtheir strange, unearthly language, and the constantpeering into our faces, occasioned us much discom-fort.

On a miserable bed ofstraw and rags, in one corner of the room, in a half-sitting, half-reclining position, was a Chinaman ofthat unfortunate class already referred to—the lepers.He was moaning and sobbing, crying out, '' I haveI am starving."Hun-had no rice for two days ;dreds had passed his door, and his cry of distress hadgone forth for more than a day, but no one hadturned aside even to save him from starving.Forfive years he had been suffering from the malady, andhis old mother had plowed in the rice fields to sup-She had watched the ravages of the dis-port him.ease, and had seen him grow worse and worse.Firsthis fingers were eaten away, and there remainednothing but the stumps of his hands, which he heldout in a most pitiful appeal. Then the lips, thecheeks, and one ear gave way to the unsatisfied rav-ages of the plague. The poor mother had looked onuntil she could no longer endure the sight of his suf-ferings ; so she concluded it would be far better forhim if he were dead,—and she left him to perish.Sick at heart from the distressing scene, we madeour way to the great Confucian Temple. The out-side of the building bears the appearance of a theater,wilh cheap-looking, porcelain finish, which in Chinais considered highly artistic.Instead of a spire, ordome, a collection of hideous nondescript imagesforms a central piece on the top of the building, andCHINA.149The wholethe eaves are adorned in similar fashion.unsightly mass is dedicated to Confucius.
