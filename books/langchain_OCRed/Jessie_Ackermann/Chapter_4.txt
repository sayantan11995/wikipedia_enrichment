CHAPTER  I.A LAND OF MANY CHARMS.jOME time ago I stood on the deck of an out-going steamer, bent on a visit to the Sand-wich islands. We waved adieu to our friendson shore and sailed down San Francisco's beautifulbay, nine miles long by fifty miles wide, set withemerald isles, bordered with towns and villages, land-locked by mountains, and dotted with shipping fromall parts of the world. A magnificent entrance, onemile wide—Golden Gate—connects this bay with theThrough this world-famous gatewayPacific Ocean.floats a commerce second only to that of New York.Sometimes the fog marches in, silent and resistless asan army of ghosts ; then again the glory of the set-ting sun pours through it, lighting up the bay andAs it was beinglandscape with a golden radiance.thus lighted we passed out, with Lime Point on oneside, clearly outlined by the pale blue sky, and on theother, high, rugged hills, covered to the summit withgreen in all shades.We passed the great rocks over which creep and crawlthe ugly, lazy sea-lions, where, protected by the gov-44THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.ernment, they bark and roar, much to the interest ofthose who have never seen the *' before.We crossed the bar, reached the open sea, and beforethe shades of night fell were face to face with thegreatest ocean—a wild, weary, trackless waste of water,stretching five thousand miles away.' seal-rocks 'As the shadows of departing day lengthened, allnature seemed imbued with joy ; the very heavenswere tinged with the brightness of another world, andwe imagined we could almost see angelic hands asthey softly shifted the fleecy drapery of the skies.The sun was lost beyond the horizon ; the pale moonrose to throw its enchantment over land and sea ; onegreat star after another opened Its bright eye upon us,and we were loath to retire to our cabins.Morning dawned, but the scene was changed. I roseto make a hasty toilet, but felt compelled to desist, toretreat—in fact, to retire. The stewardess tried tocomfort me by saying, "It's only a 'swell'; it willsoon be over." The whole day passed, and "theAs I lan-swell," in fiendish glee, still pursued us.guished in my berth, through the open window camea voice singing, " Oh, for a life on the ocean wave, -ahome on the rolling deep."I could endure the sea-sickness, but the very thought of those words filledmy whole being with an intense desire to imbrue myhands in the gore of the man who wrote them toIf it were only thedelude an unsuspecting public.deep that rolled, no one would care ; but the steamerrolled—everything rolled— I rolled.As I importuned the stewardess to use her influenceTHE SANDWICH ISLANDS.45with the captain that the numerous rollings mightcease, she mildly replied, " This is nothing ; one timeI rolled out of my berth to the floor, under the oppo-site berth, out into the passage, and should have beenrolling still, had I not encountered some deck-hands,who, in the innocence of their profession, mistook mefor freight, gathered up my fragments, and depositedme in a place of safety."I spake not another word,for that woman was a better roller than I.I simplyresolved that at the end of the journey I shouldquietly count my bones to see if I were "all there,"I reached my destination in a somewhat weather-beaten condition, but in the first glimpses of dry landIt was a charm-soon forgot the discomfort of the sea.ing sight—early in the morning, the air balmy, thebay a beautiful blue, and the sun just peeping abovethe water's edge, shedding its rays over land and sea.I felt that we had reached a new world.The first sight of land is Koko Head, a point risingabruptly from the sea, extending into a range of hills,irregular and broken, and covered with many shadesof green, making a most beautiful view from thesteamer.The pilot came aboard, and very soon I was landedin one of the most lovely spots that fortune has everfavored me with seeing.Of the eleven islands whichcompose the Hawaiian group, eight only are inhab-These include an area of six thousand squareited.miles, and have a climate so charming that hundredshasten hither as a refuge from storms and blasts.In Hawaii there are numerous snow-capped mount-46THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.ains, and volcanoes not a few.

The cocoanutpalm is said by Mark Twain to be " the exclamation' of tropical scenery. The tree grows verypoint 'high—sometimes to the height of seventy-five feet—THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.49towering up without a branch or leaf until within afew feet of the top, where among the long, gracefulleaves can be seen clusters of fruit.This is gathered,at great risk of life, by the native boys, who put thesoles of their feet flat against the tree, and, hand overfoot, reach the top, a feat to which the whites arewholly unequal. The beauty of the groves is greatlymarred by the leaning of the trees, caused by strongsea-winds which blow against them until they inclinein every direction and at every angle.Hawaii is also the home of the banana.Greatgroves are cultivated by the Chinese. A tree nevercomes to fructesceuce but once ; as " the aloe blossomsand dies," so this tree " fruits " and dies, is cut down,and a new tree must take its place, growing from thesame roots, before other fruit appears.One of the chief industries of the island is theAs we drove through thegrowing of sugar-cane.valley great fields of tall, standing cane waved in thebreeze, and hundreds of natives were busily engagedin the cultivation of the product that has broughtmillions to at least one man.In the lowlands we saw a plant of rare beauty andlearned that this was the vegetable upon which theIt has beautiful foliage, withnatives chiefly subsist.broad, shining leaves very like a calla leaf, and isoften grown in our hothouses under the botanicalThe root only isname of Caladiiun esculentiim.used, and is prepared after the manner of mashedpotatoes, milk being added until it is reduced to theThe natives dip twoconsistency of cake dough.50THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.in the yard.fingers into the compound, and thus convey it to theirmouths, never using a spoon.

Many of thewomen are good-looking, tall and graceful of figure,and are nearly always well dressed.
