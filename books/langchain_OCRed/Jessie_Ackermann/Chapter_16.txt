CHAPTER  IV.A MISSIONARY CONFERENCE.—AN OPIUM PALACE.|HE great excitement in Shanghai at thistime was the coming together of mission-aries, from all parts of the empire, who arewont to thus assemble to discuss ways and means andgeneral methods of work. They came five hundredstrong, and as some of them were from the very heartof China, — so vast in area, so swarming with humanlife, so immersed in darkness,—they came breathingthe needs of the nation upon the very air that itmight be wafted to the lands beyond, and a Mace-donian cry fall upon the ears of those in distantcountries. Some of these good people had traveledthree months, either by cart or mule back, to reachOne missionary walked hundreds ofthe convention.miles, preaching the gospel all the way, and reached"But," said he,the city in an almost dying condition," I preached a sermon nearly a thousand miles long."The workers of the China Inland Mission came innative dress, which costume they adopt before goinginto the interior, regarding it as a means of protection.The garments were not unbecoming to some of thesweet-faced girls, but it required a great amount ofgood looks to offset the rigid severity of the dress.;l6iCHINA.The men—well, it was positively funny to see them !When the first one was ushered into my presence itwas with great eflFort that I suppressed a smile.Thisauburn-tressed son of England had adopted the dressof a better class.

A Chinaman would takehold of a woman by the arm, and pull away withseven-horse-power to drag her out of the humandebris, and as she was thus violently withdrawn itwas with sad parting from some of her raiment, mak-ing it necessary to beat a hasty retreat.

The first place we visited was a large structurethree stories high, the whole of which was given upto opium smoking, as many as two thousand indulg-ing every night. We reached the "palace" aboutmidnight, when the greatest number were comingand going, and the place was fairly teeming with;165CHINA.tsiUvjkers. The crowds passed us up and down, push-ing us to right and left, making it anything but aneasy task to reach the upper part of the building.The first floor was one large room divided into stalls.The partitions extended but part way to the ceiling,In each stall wasand archways served as doors.room for eight smokers.

Some weretaking their first pipe, paying special attention to thebusiness in hand ; others had taken just enough tomake them happy or silly. One would look up withan idiotic grin, muttering something in an undertone,and puffing away at his pipe ; another would lie in astupor, wholly unconscious of what was going on,from which he would awake after a time and call formore opium. The air was black and heavy withsmoke and the fumes of the drug. As we went fromstall to stall we were obliged to fan away the cloudsof smoke before we could see what was going on. Oneach floor the rich and poor, the high and low,through the fascination for this drug, met on thesame footing.After having visited the dens a few times it was aneasy matter to tell who smoked and who did not, sodecided are the traces of this drug on all who indulge.3ome of the poor wretches seemed to be on the verge1 66CHINA.of the grave, they were so wasted in form.Theiiskin was drawn over their bones and their sunkeneyes and strange color told only too plainly of thegrim monster that was on their track.In severalit was not a commonstalls (though I was toldI saw mothers smoking, with their babessight),propped up at their sides, and I have seen little chil-dren not more than three or four years of age quitestupid from the effects of the drug.

The coolie put a heavystrap around his shoulders and fastened the ends tothe handles of the wheelbarrow, pushing us with allhis might.
