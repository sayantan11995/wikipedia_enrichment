CHAPTER  III.FROM SINGAPORE TO MANDALAY.|T WOULD be supposed that any sortofaccommodation could be secured from Sin-gapore, where can be seen almost everykind of craft that is propelled by steam, sailed by can-vas, or sent gliding down the bay by the strong handof the native ; but in traveling along all the easterncoasts it is almost impossible to find comfortable quar-It was my unhappy fate toters on the steamers.As usual the dis-take passage on a Dutch steamer.comfort of seasickness was upon me, and I was unableto go on deck for a few days.

The prospect of sailing fora few days with a fever-stricken crew was anythingbut pleasant, but as the open sea afforded no desira-ble means of escape I settled down and decided, as2092IOJAVA AND BURMAH.one must so often do in tramping the earth, to makethe best of it.The Sumatran port was reached about midnight,and the ship dropped anchor only long enough totake on the troops. No one was allowed to goashore. As we anchored no sight or sound of troopswas seen or heard ; but presently, borne on the wingsof the breeze, came notes of martial music. As itapproached nearer and nearer, we heard the steadytramp of feet, and in a short time the soldiers were allThose who were able to walk, marched onaboard.board ; others, in the more advanced stages of thedisease, were carried ; and the steamer put to seaagain, all drawing a breath of relief and none fearingthe fever, which was not contagious.We sailed next day over smooth waters, amid spiceislands, the air heavy with pungent odors and theperfume of flowers, until the sun of that day fadedbehind the beauty of an island, and evening wasupon us. The soft twilight shades soon lengthenedinto darkness ; then the pale moon rose and threw aweird light over the scene ; one great star after an-other spangled the heavens, and night swept on.The steamer's lights were turned low, and " tirednature's sweet restorer " had come to some on board.But on the lower deck weary eyes refused to close, andwere filled with tears of sorrow ; men moved aboutwith noiseless tread and almost hushed breath, givingorders in an undertone. An officer came to where Iwas seated on the deck—the heat of the cabin hadbecome unendurable—and said, '' Some of the sol-Suriutia Wmnai:3JA VA AND B URMAH.diers have died, and must be buried at sea.

The lastbrave soldier who died had asked that the flag of hiscountry might form his winding-sheet.His com-rades, many of whom had fought and suffered withhim, carried out his dying request. The flag ofHolland was wound about him, and tenderly theylifted him to the plank ; I heard another splash andthe steamer moved on.There can be nothing moredistressing than a burial at sea. On the Dutch shipno service was read or prayer offered ; it was simplya matter of casting overboard.The next morning we gathered at the table, but noword of the sad scene was spoken.It was a thing ofthe past, and the pressing duties of the hour haddriven it out of our thoughts.In this changefulworld of ours, joy and sorrow are ever crowding uponeach other; the tear is soon dried and gives way to asmile, or a smile quickly passes to give place to atear—and the old world rolls on just the same.I became engaged in conversation with the captain,who was a true son of Holland, but spoke Englishwell. He at once took me for one who had wandered214JAVA AND BURNAH.Just how hefrom the land of the stars and stripes.was able to locate me I am unable to say—probablyby my good looks !I found him the most profaneman I had ever met in my life ; in fact, he seemed tohave determined to punctuate every sentence he ut-I was the only lady passenger,tered with profanity.but he swore in conversing with me just as he did inFinally I said, " Captain, whytalking to the men.do you swear so?" The man opened his eyes inutter astonishment, and said, "Why, did I swear?If I did, I assure you I did not know it." He wasmost profuse in his apologies, and begged I wouldnot consider it a lack of respect for a lady.With the echo of oaths reaching my ears from timeto time, we sailed on until we reached the shores ofBurmah, that country whose native government wasrecently overthrown by force of arms, and which thusbecame part of the vast posessions of British India.The Burmese government was purely despotic—theking sentenced to imprisonment, torture or death,according to his pleasure, without trial, or the leastEverything connected with thepretence to justice.king was said to be " golden."
