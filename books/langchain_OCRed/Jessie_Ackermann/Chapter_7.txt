CHAPTER  I.FROM AUCKLAND TO WELLINGTON.|MONG the English dependencies the coloniesof Australasia are the least known, or, ifknown at all, are usually associated withthe conditions of primitive days, all marks of whichhave disappeared save a few great buildings that standunworthy monuments to a system of most inhumanWhen the last of these buildings hastreatment.been leveled to the ground little will remain to tellthe tale of early cruelties, and Australasia will beknown to the world as it really is—the workingman'sparadise ; a laud of sunshine, fruit and flowers, oflimitless resources and possibilities, and destined tobecome one of the greatest republics on the globe.The remote situation of the islands forming Austral-asia, the infrequent communication with them, andthe great length of time required for the journey(five weeks from England, four from Africa, and fourfrom America), give one the idea that it is a somewhatunimportant country ; hence extensive travel throughthe colonies is a continual surprise.My first visit was from the direction of the SouthSeas ; this brought me to Auckland after a long voy-72NEW ZEALAND AND TASMANIA.age of which the starting point was San Francisco.The steamers employed in this service are principallyfreight boats, and the accommodation is anything butOne hundred and fifty names made upfirst-class.the passenger list ; commercial travelers, tourists andpreachers were among the number.Every possibledevice was resorted to in our attempt to pass thehours.

The bride was avery young, sweet creature, who had never beenabroad before, and the groom was a bright English-it was some-man, but a wretched sailor.I have never known anyonething pitiful to see him.Again and again he declaredso affected by the sea.Poor soul !NEW ZEALAND AND TASMANIA.75that if he had committed all the sins in the calendar,and broken the entire decalogue, his punishment hadFinally, when it became un-far outrun his offense.bearable and he could no longer retain a morsel offood after having tried every known remedy, heresolved to abandon the trip and return home. Aswe neared Auckland he made his intentions knownto his bride, who soon rose to a state of revolt, anddeclared she would go on alone.Auckland wasreached, and each prepared to carry out a separateplan, he to return to England by way of America, andshe to make her lonely pilgrimage through the dis-tant Red Sea.True to their resolves they each fin-ished their wedding trip alone, and arrived in Englandin safety.The approach to Auckland is most beautiful, andreaching it as we did, just when the morning lighthad bathed the landscape in a sea of glory, we saw itat especial advantage. The long projection known asNorth Cape extends into the sea at the left, and tothe right can be seen a perfectly round island calledRangitoto, which means "the bloody sky."It issupposed that the natives have at some time seen theisland in a state of eruption, hence the name. Thewhole country is of volcanic formation.Auckland is situated amid a cluster of hills on asmall strip of land almost surrounded by water. Onthe east, an arm of the sea extends inland, almostmeeting another arm extending inland from the otherside ; only a quarter of a mile of land preserves thisprojection from being an island. The city is quaint—76NEIV ZEALAND AND TASMANIA.life and appearance.and decidedly English in itsOne feature that greatly impressed me was the re-markable degree to which the Sabbath is observed.The streets are wholly free from trafl&c of any kind,and it is only with difficulty that a cab can be hired.Persons accustomed to driving during the week givetheir horses a well-deserved rest on the Sabbath, andtake time to quietly walk to church.Indeed, the ab-sence of rush and hurry forms one of the most re-freshing features of residence in this far-away town.Another thing I remarked was that the common bar-tender of other lands had here been supplanted byyoung women who wholly monopolized the positiona sight somewhat shocking to those unaccustomedto it.About the streets of Auckland I noticed manyswarthy-skinned natives, and was anxious to learnsomething of their customs and habits.In appear-ance they are much like some of the tribes of NorthAmerican Indians— tall, well built, with straightblack hair, flat noses, low foreheads, large teeth, anddark eyes. They speak a language not unlike that ofthe Hawaiians, and are very intelligent, more so Ishould say than are any of the natives of the SouthSeas. When the missionaries first went to New Zea-land ihey found the natives (Maoris) in a semi-barbar-ous state, given to the worship of idols, and possessedof the superstitions common to primitive races. Someof these superstitions they retain to the present day.The Maoris have been given a section of land knownas the " King's country," where they are comfortablyNEW ZEALAND AMD TASMANIA.79quartered. They are gradually decreasing in num-bers, a fact attributed to the introduction of strongdrink, which has a fatal effect upon them. One ofthe tribe, a dangerous character, has given the au-thorities very much trouble. Some years ago, duringthe outbreak between the natives and the whites, hemurdered in cold blood forty of the opposing forces,and although he is a very old man he has causedmuch alarm because of his lawless spirit.I visitedhim in the Auckland jail, and found a desperate indi-vidual who became almost violent in insisting on hisrelease ; this was finally granted by the authorities oncondition that he go at once to the King's country.They still have a chief of the tribe who calls himselfking, but he is peace-loving and law-abiding.Like many natives, these of New Zealand excelin wood carving.It is remarkable that at an earlyday this almost savage race should have displayedso much skill in this art.In many of the museumsof the colonies can be seen valuable specimens of thework of present generations.One of the principal industries carried on by thesenatives is the digging for Kawri gum, which is foundin great quantities imbedded in the earth.It is thegum of the tree which covered the land ages ago.The supposition is that in some volcanic eruptionthese vast forests were buried in the earth, and thedecayed trees left large deposits. The substance isvery hard and flinty, and is largely used in the manu-facture of jewelry. When highly polished it resem-bles amber, and, mourited in elaborate silver settings8oNEIV ZEALAND AND TASMANIA.makes very handsome ornaments. A green stone,greatly prized by the natives, and often worn by thewhites, is also found ; this, too, is polished, and madeinto charms and jewelry of various kinds.its penalties attached.Leaving the north island, less is seen of the natives,their reservation being wholly in the upper part ofNew Zealand.I journeyed southward from Auck-This mode of travel always hasland in a small boat.It is true the scenery wasbeautiful — towering mountains, softly murmuring,streams, clear bright sky, indescribable sunsets, andviews varied by the coloring of blooming fruit treesstanding out among highly cultivatedlowlands.Under some circumstances I should have gone intoraptures over the beauty of nature, but on this littletossing craft, the very movement of which seemed tohypnotize me and place me completely under itsspell, I confess the landscape, from my point of view,had very little charm.

Thechief drawback is a strong wind that sweeps the bayat least nine months of the year.The city is not especially attractive. The principalobject of interest is a fine specimen of native carv-ing—a Naon house, a valuable relic of ancient workpurchased by the government for the small sum of fivehundred dollars. The house was built many yearsago as a monument to Camata Waaka Tuarrgere,It waselder brother of the chief of the natives.erected on the Island of Mana, in Poverty Bay, andis of carved totra, a costly native wood. The workwas done by some of the most celebrated wood-work-ers of that day. The building is forty-three feet long,twelve feet wide, and contains thirty-four figuresintended to represent the most noted ancestors formany generations past. The work surpasses any-thing of the kind executed by the present generation,and it was a happy thought on the part of the govern-ment to secure and preserve this example of ancientnative handiwork. The figures are all about thesame size in height, and to the casual observer seemmuch alike ; but when a native enters the room he atonce recognizes the figures representing the stock fromThe panels arewhich his family has descended.carved on one side only, and are placed, with the moststriking effect, at regular intervals of about four feetIn the same house is aalong the sides of the room.large collection of native gods, the worship of whichhas long since been abandoned.
