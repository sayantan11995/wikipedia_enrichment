We sailed out of the smooth waters ofthe bay into the ever-restless China Sea, throughwhich I had already passed, and of which I stillBecause of theretained most lively recollections.on-coming storm I remained in my cabin for threedays, seeing no one but the pig-tailed celestial who,in reply to my question as to the whereabouts of the170SIAM.171Stewardess, blandly informed me that he was '' theThree days later, when I was able tostewardess."get on deck, I encountered the captain for the firsttime, and to my astonishment found that I was theonly white passenger; indeed, the captain, four offi-cers and myself were the only white persons on board.The ship was manned by Malays, Javanese and Cin-galese, and was "loaded" with thirteen hundredChinese coolies, who were being taken to Singaporeand Bangkok.In this strange company I was tospend thirteen days. The captain was very kind.When he learned that I was a poor sailor he tookother quarters for himself, and had his large, airycabin made ready for me, which added greatly to mycomfort.The class of Chinese who leave their own countryare usually the very lowest, and this cargo of humanfreight was no exception. To add to their generalunattractiveness many of them were afflicted with soreeyes and skin diseases. A portion of the ship wascurtained off with heavy canvas, and here the coolieswere packed in like so many sheep. They slept ondeck on a piece of matting and the usual Chinesepillow, which is made either of crockery or wood.During the day their chief occupation was gambling,and their continuous chatter could be heard throughGambling and opium-smoking arethe entire night.forbidden on shipboard, yet it was evident that theserules were not enforced on this boat, for both wereengaged in, frequently with unhappy results.One day, toward evening, I sat in the saloon pon-172SIAM.dering, weak and weary, over a rusty volume of forgotten lore—for I was wont, on this long trip, to studyWhile I was thus engaged, Iup ancient history.heard an unusual sound.Stepping to the door tosee what it might mean I encountered the captain,apparently greatly alarmed, for he was ashy pale.Before I had time to speak, he took me by the shoul-ders, turned me about, pushed me into the cabin, andIt was all done in a moment, and nolocked the door.word of explanation was uttered by the greatly ex-cited captain; I was simply locked up, very much asTruth to tell,a little child might be for punishment.I was so indignant at the captain for this school-girl-like treatment that I almost forgot to be afraid of whatnext happened. The noise increased.I heard thecaptain order out the guns and swords. A great rushwas made to the room next to the one in which I wasincarcerated, and I could hear the general haulingdown of implements of warfare, though with no ideaBefore my mind passed a truly awfulof the cause.panorama—for I thought of pirates, who so often fre-quent that sea, and feared that if I escaped with mylife at all, it would be to wade ankle-deep throughhuman blood.These thoughts were banished onlyto give room to the idea that it might be mutiny, forI knew there was little love lost between the captainand his crew.For two hours the awful suspenselasted.

When at last the captain opened thedoor, and I learned that the cause of the commotionwas only a riot, and I had been locked up for fear ISIAM.173would faint away, my indignation knew no bounds.It seemed that the gamblers fell into a dispute overthe game, and a quarrel ensued, during which one ofthe men was picked up and thrown over the rail intoThe vessel was stopped, and an attemptthe sea.made to rescue the drowning man, but without suc-cess.

Thegreat waves were left behind, and the salt sea-breezegave place to a languid air which lulled us into softrepose, a state easily reached in that country. Oneach side the banks were fringed with tropical vege-tation, and in the distance we could see the tall cocoaand betelnut trees lift their plumed heads like a rowof knights. A delightful sail of twenty miles up thisriver brought us to the city of Bangkok, the capital ofSiam.Arrangements had been made that my first view ofthe city should be from the top of a great pagoda.We steamed off in a little launch and made our wayKati.

Old women, wrinkled and wornand scantily clad, cry out their wares in sharp andshrill tones, while small children, both. boys and girls,try to outcry them. The noise and bustle continuefor some hours, when the venders return to theirplace of rest for food and a midday nap ; there theyremain until the sun disappears behind the toweringcocoanut and betel trees.Unlike the Chinese, these people livein boathouses instead of house-boats.
