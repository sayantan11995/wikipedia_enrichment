CHAPTER  I.KILLING TIME ON SHIPBOARD.|HE most cosmopolitan gathering in which Iever found myself was in a crowded steamerstarting on a long voyage ; better opportu-nity for studying character is rarely afforded.Isthere anything in the world more interesting than thestudy of our fellow creatures, each cast in a differentmold, with such varied characteristics ? We look inwonder upon nature, studying it in all its forms, fromthe buttercup af our feet to the mighty oak liftingits proud head above us ; we are fascinated by the skillof man, and stand amazed before his handiwork ;but nothing affords such a source of never-endingstudy and surprise as humanity. The chance to in-dulge in such study came to me en route from Aus-It was in the month of May, thetralia to Africa.early autumn of the former land, that I took passageby the only line of steamers plying between thosecountries, and found myself among all conditions ofmen and women.The voyage before us was long— one month out ofsight of land. The steamer was a freight boat with258AFRICA.Many had lost all ;passenger accommodations ; and even with delightfulcompany the journey would not have been the mostThe day after we left,desirable thing to undertake.when all view of land was lost, we turned our atten-tion to " getting settled."All were strangers to oneanother, and after a general summing up all round,and determining in our own minds who were the good-tempered and most companionable ones, we formedourselves into little groups—to talk about the others.It was at the time of the great financial collapse inothers, with whatAustralia.little remained, had turned their faces towards a newcountry, hoping in a brief time to retrieve their di-In Africa there was much excite-minished estates.ment over recent discoveries of gold ; and thithermost were journeying as toward the promised land.Many were hard-working people, who usually makeup the population of mining regions the world over.Others were " speculators " — in plain English, gam-blers. Two ladies were on their way to be married ;one had reached—yes, had passed— the midsummer oflife, and amused herself by humming,"This way I long have sought, and mourned because I foundit not."One couple were on their way to England to bemarried, taking their honeymoon in advance. Twodoctors, intending to practice their arts on the unsus-pecting miner, were among the number. An Englishmillionaire, a young lady traveling alone, and a long,lean, lank individual, who proved to be delightfulcompany, made up the passenger list.;259AFRICA.The weather was stormy the first two weeks, anddrove us under the awnings, where the limited spaceThesebrought us together like a flock of sheep.close relations proved to be not the most pleasantthing in the world, for we were sometimes forced tohear ourselves the subject of remark or criticism, athing little calculated to add to the harmony of thetrip. When the ancient spinster's joy over her happyestate was not the topic of discussion, the free ways ofthe younger were commented on.For the sake ofexcitement some of the party fell to match-making,and tried hard to break the monotony of the voyageby having a real wedding on board.This failed, sothey decided to have a mock breach of promise trialthe engaged young lady sued a cross-eyed Jew for tenthousand pounds damaged affections, I being retainedas her counsel.Of course the case was won.When the storm was over and we once again sailedin calm waters, it was only to experience great dis-comfort in our cabins ; for we were packed like sar-dines in a box, and the unventilated condition of the"rooms inclined us to imagine that the " speculatorshad gotten up " a corner " on air.One trying night,when life was a burden scarcely to be borne, and theheated condition of my cabin could no longer be en-dured, I threw my wrap about me and made my wayto the deck. The lights were out, but I groped alongto a bench, where I threw myself down, thinking toIt was a dark, darkremain only a few moments.night ; not even one star could be seen.Greatsable clouds had rolled themselves up against th^26oAFRICA.horizon like mountains of smoke, and only now andthen could be seen the face of the moon passingthrough the rifts, to be almost instantly lost again inthe blackness. Thus for a time it played hide-and-seek with the sea, upon whose bosom the reflectedclouds seemed to spread themselves, till it, too, rolledin inky blackness about us.Soon I heard the sound of voices near by, and be-came aware that I was not alone, though the hourI lifted my head and peered into the dark-was late.ness, straining my eyes in the direction whence thesound came. The clouds had again parted, and asthe moon shone out for an instant I recognized twofigures, who had now grown familiar to us, and ofwhom it was whispered, " They will make a match."I was evidently unobserved, so I resumed my reclin-ing attitude and tried to sleep ; but my ears were toounaccustomed to the words that followed, for unin-tentionally I overheard this Romeo declare to hisJuliet the tender passion that filled his heart. Whenhe had exhausted all the adjectives at his command,and failed to express all that she was and ever couldbe to him, he paused, not so much to find words asto catch breath ; then with new strength and addedvigor, he "fell to" again, and finally concluded bygasping, as with his parting breath, "Oh, thou—oh,thou—."This was too much to longer endure.One may imagine the feeling of utter loneliness thatwould creep upon an old maid, away ojBf in the middleof the sea on a dark night, in hearing such tenderheart appeals and knowing that they were meant for——261AFRICA.another.I silently withdrew to meditate upon thestrangeness of fate—perchance to slumber.The captain was splendid company, and to thebridge I often betook myself to hear him, with greatenthusiasm, tell of his efforts to solve the mysteriesStanding with him one lovely night,of the heavens.when every star shone with a beauty wholly its own,the captain said, in a half-daring way, " Why don'tyou go to the mast-head ?" My reply was, " I will,if you will go with me." A gentleman on board, aspecial friend of the captain's, was to go with us.He was sent for, and our intention was told him, withstrict injunctions " not to breathe a word about itbut whoever knew or heard of a man keeping aBefore the appointed time it had been whis-secret ?pered among the passengers that a lady was goingGreat was the astonishment, andaloft that night.much the speculation as to who the lady was. Aboutnine o'clock I withdrew to my cabin to prepare forthis new experience.I drew forth the garment thatalways forms part of my wardrobe, a divided skirtused only on special occasions—over which I put onlya jacket that my feet might be perfectly free.I tieda scarf about my ears, for the night was chilly, andtook a short cut, unobserved, to the bridge, wherethe gentlemen were in waiting."From the bridge we crossed to the steerage quarters,where we mounted the rope at the side of the ship.My heart beat faster as I put my foot on the ladderand felt it give slightly ; but with the captain on onegid^ and a fearless gentleman on the other, I took262AFRICA."
