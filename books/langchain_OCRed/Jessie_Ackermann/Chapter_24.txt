The pagoda is built on a rise of land cover-it is solid, cone-shaped—diminishinging some acres ;in rounded outlines—and surmounted by an umbrellaspire, covered with gold leaf to the very point.Flight after flight of stairslead to the elevationwhere the place of worship is built.All about thegrounds are small archways, temples, and all mannerof fantastic-shaped shelters for the hundreds of idolsset up around the pagoda.These are of alabaster,wood and brass, and have been set up by devoutworshipers as works of merit. They are in everypossible attitude—reclining, sitting cross-legged andstanding—all representing the founder of their faith,The fingersGautama, commonly called Buddha,and toes are all the same length— a special mark ofbeauty.

Asthe richly dressed worshiper lifted his silken robes toprevent contact with the stone steps, he paid no atten-tion to the misery of the beggars, but as their cries of," Oh, rich man, give us rice for to-day ?

On this mountain werethe famous caves we intended to visit.They werediscovered some centuries ago, and a pious-mindedBurmese conceived the idea of laying up an unusualamount of " merit " by turning the caves into a greattemple.
