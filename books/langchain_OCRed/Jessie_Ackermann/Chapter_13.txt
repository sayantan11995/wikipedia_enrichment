CHAPTER  I.FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE FLOWERY KINGDOM.|HE country whose name holds fewest allure-ments for the tourist is China. The lowerclass of the Chinese have scattered them-selves to the ends of the earth, taking with themtheir vices and unclean mode of life, which have fos-tered disease to such an extent that the very name ofChina has become a dread to many communities.Itis in this way that the opinions of the outside worldconcerning the "Flowery Kingdom" have beenmolded ; and because of this, even the most enthusi-astic globe trotter turns toward that land with a feel-ing that is something akin to fear.As a matter of fact there is far more civilizationamong the Chinese than we give them credit for.When the inhabitants of the British Isles were paintedsavages, China enjoyed a degree of cultivation. WunWang, who lived during the reign of David, wrote abook that now ranks among the classics, and is one ofthe standard works in the schools of to-day. WhenMoses was leading the children of Israel through the129)I30CHINA.Red Sea, the Chinese were a settled people, havingthe same form of government under vi^hich they nowSince then the famous empires of Assyria, Bab-live.ylon, Greece and Rome have waxed and waned, andpassed away, and China alone stands the sole relic ofpatriarchal days.I confess that the country had very little fascinationfor me, as I contemplated a somewhat extended tripamong the celestials, and I started toward its shoreswith strange forebodings ; but the day was set onwhich I was to embark in the " China mail steamer,"and there was no drawing back.(Shades of Fulton !That " mail steamer ! " — a small tea boat with a fewcabins in which passengers were to be stowed awayfor a month !I took passage from a northern city on the eastcoast of Australia, and surmounted difficulties not afew in getting to the anchored steamer, far down theI was taken off in the freight tender—a primi-bay.tive affair intended only for cargo and live stock.Istood on the wharf while this was being loaded ; sawthe sheep and about a dozen Chinese put on, and thenI went down with the rest of the live stock. The piti-less rays of a tropical sun beat upon us as, unpro-tected by awning or cover, we alternately broiled,baked and stewed in that torrid climate.I sat look-ing first into the faces of the innocent sheep, then atthe bland Chinaman — (Oh, the meek and childlike)—wonder-John ! Who on earth can smile like he ?ing which looked the more innocent, when my atten-tion was arrested by a man at one end of the tender—131CHINA.actively engaged in what seemed to be a great labor.I rose from the candle-box on which I was seated, andsaw he was preparing biscuit. He kept kneadingand kneading away—the perspiration rolling fromhis forehead and chin— until his doughy preparationwas ready for the oven, for he was at the head of theculinary department, and it was near the dinner hour.Some time later, one of the freight hands, a kind-hearted soul, asked me if I would have a cup of tea,to which I assented. He hastened off, and soon re-turned with an immense, thick cup, brimful of tea,and beside the cup reposed some of the very biscuitwhich the cook had been so recently engaged in man-I took the tea, and, when the man's backufacturing.was turned, fed the fish with the biscuit.The mail steamer was soon reached, and I foundthat I was the only woman passenger booked throughMost of those on board were on their wayfor China.to the northern gold fields beyond Port Darwin, ofwhich place it is said there is only a sheet of brownpaper between it and a very warm climate we some-At this port they all disembarked,times hear of.leaving one solitary Jew and myself to continue ourjourney.All went well for a day or two, but the China Seathat stormy body of water dreaded by the oldestand most skillful navigators— fully sustained its repu-tation, and entered into a conspiracy with the elementsto display their fury.

The little Hebrew was terror-stricken ; as formyself—well, when the captain came to assure usthat there was no danger, I had reached the statethat reconciled Mark Twain to a storm : first he wasseized with an awful dread that he might die, thenwith a worse dread that he might not die.I hadreached this last frame of mind, and told the captainit was a splendid experience from which to gain " dy-There is no doubt about it—the sensa-ing grace."tion of hopelessness that comes upon one in a timeof such awful peril is a good experience.The tempest lasted three days, and when, at length,we were informed that we could have our portsopened, it came to us with a sense of relief such as onemight feel in being resurrected from a too previousI have seldom had anything so impress meburial.as the dawn of the day after the storm. The waves,having spent their force, were content to lie in darkfolds against the ship, tossing it from side to side.The somber hues of departing night were reflectedupon the bosom of the angry sea, and the grayof the early morning lent additional weirdness to thescene. The only noise above the moan of the windsthrough the rigging, and the dash of the heavy seaagainst the boat, was the steady tramp of the matekeeping his lonely watch on the bridge.Three days later, early in the morning, while the——133CHINA.moon was yet high in the heavens, we came in sightof Hong-Kong.Anxious to catch the first sight ofChina I hastened on deck, whence a scene of greatbeauty burst upon me. The moon and stars nevershone more brightly— it was almost as light as dayand we could plainly see on our right the sand-hillsthat skirt the mainland, and on our left the largerhills that form the island on which is built the beau-It is but a wee dot in the sea,tiful city of Victoria.consisting of only a range of hills, rising in someplaces with great abruptness, and in others gentlysloping to the water. The city extends some threemiles along the shore and up the hills to the summitof the highest peak, a distance of twenty-four hun-dred feet. A narrow footpath winds around this hillIn addition to th.is is a recently con-to the very top.structed tramway, a portion of which is so steep thatin looking toward the shore a hair-raising, marrow-freezing sensation creeps over one.As we dropped anchor swarms of natives in smallboats descended upon the steamer to take us ashore,and remained near by till morning was full upon us.The captain pointed out one of these small boatsabout fifteen feet in length— in which he said, a familyof four generations had been living for years ! Atone end of the boat (called a " sampan ") a mattingmade of bamboo, extended over a large hoop reach-ing to the gunwales, afforded protection from the sun.Under this the entire family ate, slept, cooked andlived, rarely going ashore.These scenes around the steamer in the early morn-134CHINA.ing hours, formed a comprehensive and sad commen-tary on China.

He pointed tothe heights of the great hills before us, on whichstood many beautiful buildings, and said, "Everystone and stick of timber used in putting up thosebuildings were carried on the shoulders of the na-tives, usually the women."In the interior it is acommon sight to see a woman and a buffalo harnessedtogether plowing in the rice fields.The city of Victoria is decidedly strange in appear-ance, and were it not for the multitude that throngthe streets, it would have the appearance of a ruinedtown.

The teeming millions thathive in this city are truly past all calculation.In-deed, the most astonishing feature of China is theIf I had been trying todensity of its population.picture the entire population of the earth, I couldnever have conceived the multitude that here pressupon one at every turn.In being borne through thenarrow streets of the city, the chatter of the passingthrong is almost deafening.Going down the river the captain pointed out theplace where the opium was seized and burned.Thiscaused that cruel war with England in which notonly thousands of the people were slain, but whichresulted in the greatest evil of the century beingthrust upon the populace, for the opium traffic hasbrought to the venerable empire death in its streetsand desolation in its homes.While I was in Cantonsome Chinese pirates who had looted a coasting boatwere captured, and the command had gone forth thatIt would seem that thethey should be beheaded.sum total of all cruelty could be found in the natureof the Chinaman, for his fertility in inventing inhu-man means of torture could scarce be equaled thisside of the bottomless pit.

Thecommon mode of punishment at present is beheading,and the execution ground is one of the " sights" ofthe city.

Themode of execution is most primitive.The prisoners1 38CHINA.are brought to the grounds chained one to another ;a heavy stake is driven in the earth, and one of thevictims is led forward with his hands pinioned infront of him. He falls upon his knees near the stake,to which his arms are fastened ; the head is thenthrown forward until the chin rests on the chest,leaving the back of the neck exposed. The execu-tioner steps forward with a sharp meat-ax, and, withone well-aimed blow, the head is severed from thebody, and is hastily picked up and placed in a jar.Criminals are usually convicted on circumstantialevidence, and seldom, if ever, have a proper trial.Death is not always the penalty meted out to law-For small offenses the criminal is made anbreakers.example of. A large square board with a hole in thecenter is placed around the neck and locked with apadlock. The criminal is then placed in the publicstreets as a warning to those not inclined to regardthe law. The board is so large that it prevents thevictim's hands from reaching his face, and thus thepoor creature is kept all day from tasting food. Num-bers of these criminals are driven out every morningand back in the evening, for a greater or less time,according to the offense.The missionaries, merchants and commercial menwho live without the wall of Canton form a commun-ity of their own.

Oh, thatI had another life to give to China!"But all thoseforty years of hard work have left no impress—thecity is not even touched by the Gospel ; and, humanlyspeaking, the evangelization of China seems a hope-less task.
