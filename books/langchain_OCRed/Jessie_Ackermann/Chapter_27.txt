CHAPTER  III.PESHAWAR AND THE KHYBER PASS.|HEN I reached India I found it a muchlarger country than I had expected, and Iwas surprised to learn that I could go fromthe most southerly city to the northern boundary byrail. The journey is a long and very tiresome one ;it cannot be taken in comfort unless one supplieshis own bed.This necessitates a servant, and endlesstrouble in making your needs known.But finallythe great plains were crossed, and I reached Peshawarat the gateway to Afghanistan.This is a very curi-ous city, unlike any other place in India. The oldcity is surrounded by a high wall with sixteen gates,all of which are closed by nine o'clock, after whichno one is admitted without countersigns and pass-words.Within the walls of this city there are only fourwhite people ; these are all young women from Eng-land in charge of the Woman's Hospital.Theirhouse is surrounded by walls about forty feet high,and the gateway is guarded by armed sepoys.Inleaving the hospital to drive, walk, or visit a patient,the young ladies always go under escort.I went tothe top of the house to view the city and surround-ings. The houses are peculiar to this place—builtof sun-dried bricks and plastered over with mud.Around the top of each house is built lattice-work,through which the women of the family may look234INDTA.237They bring theirunseen into the streets below.spinning to this place, and in small groups work andchatter the days away.Driving through the city I saw a very different raceof people from those in central and southern India.The city is cosmopolitan, and the frontier people min-gle to an extent unknown in any other part of thecountry. The natives from Cashmere were especiallyinteresting, and their dress was peculiar to them-selves. The season was winter, and somewhat severefor that country, so these people were clad in theirThe outer were made of goat-warmest garments.skin, worn fur side in. The long fur coat reachedalmost to the ankles, and was belted in at the waistTheir boots were of heavy leather,with a knit scarf.loose and baggy at the ankles, with upturned toes.On their heads were cone-shaped skin hats ; thesewere also worn hair side in, and the hair hung downover their foreheads like modern bangs. The wholemake-up gave them a very strange appearance.The city is chiefly Mohammedan, and early in themorning, before daylight, can be heard the call toprayer. A Mohammedan with strong lungs andheavy voice goes through the city crying, " O sleeper,arise and pray ; there is but one God and his prophetis Mohammed !Beyond the city, towards the north, lie the greatplains, shut in by three ranges of mountains—sandyfoot-hills without a shrub or blade of grass, then agreater elevation, and, finally, the highest range,Through thesecovered with a late fall of snow."—238INDIA.Of these passes Khyber is most noted.ranges of such vast extent, three passes lead to thecountries beyond, forming the only means of commu-nication.Itis the gateway to Afghanistan, that country whoseruler is fearful the whole world will invade his pos-I determined to at least go through thesessions.pass, and the natural perversity of woman's naturefilled me with desire to commit the forbidden actenter his domain.Arrangements were soon made and I was readyfor the journey. The morning was bitterly cold ;white , frost had fallen upon everything, and eventhrough my thick robes and wraps I could feel thewintry breeze. A drive of eight miles over a drearywaste such as could never be described, brought us tothe fort, which is the end of the Indian possessions.Towering in awful grandeur before us rose the highpeaks of the mountain range through which we wereto ride thirty miles before the closely guarded terri-tory of the Ameer would be reached. The pass isfilled with bandits and outlaws—who live in cavernsin the rocks and holes in the earth—making the jour-I had applied to the governmentney most unsafe.for troops, and found them in readiness for me at thefort.

On the summits of the lower hills wereround houses used as lookout posts, and in thesewere stationed hundreds of armed sepoys. As soonas a footfall is heard on the road they spring to theirposts and in their native tongue cry out, "Traveler,pass on ; you are safe, you are safe."When half way through we came upon the fortThis is situated at an elevation ofof Ali Masgid.three thousand feet, and commands a fine view ofI made my way to theboth entrances to the pass.top to see a caravfin coming from Cabool, the capitalBy the aid of the field-glass I couldof Afghanistan.see camels, hundreds strong, littleasses weighteddown with great burdens, and many Indian cattle.They made their way over the winding road ; nowand then a camel would find its way over a hill,making a short cut, and come out some distance inadvance of the others. The burdens carried by thecamels were so great that one animal would oftenThey wererequire the whole width of the road.bringing down dried fruits, peaches and apricotsalso green fruits, pomegranates and pineapples. The244INDIA.common pottery and prayer-rugs used by the Mo-hammedans formed part of their burdens.After the animals carrying the merchandise hadpassed, came camels carrying the native women, formany families were coming down to India to live. Alarge dry-goods box was fastened to each side of thecamel, and in these the women were stored away, asmany as six or seven in a box. They belonged tothe high-caste people, so their faces were not allowedto be seen, and their garments were so fashioned thatthey covered the entire body. Two small holes werecut out of the dress for the eyes, but aside from thisno feature of the women could be seen.Concealedby this queer raiment the women were allowed tocome out of the zenanas and travel in the caravan.The camels were driven by low-caste Afghan women,who wore tattered trousers, and had wild-lookingeyes and screeching voices. They carried very heavysticks, with which they urged on a lazy camel or re-minded an innocent-looking ass of their presence.With these strange-looking people, and strangerAt Pesha-surroundings, I traveled back to India.war, the English keep immense stacks of telegraphpoles and railroad ties and rails, that they may pre-pare for an outbreak at short notice, for Russia issaid to look with longing eyes in that direction.

One night when the great city waswrapped in slumber we made our way, in companywith a Christian guide, to the spot where the Tajstands. We passed under the great archway andalong the winding path, amid playing fountains andblooming flowers, to the foot of the steps leading tothe platform. A strange feeling took possession ofme as I mounted those steps leading to a place ofwhich I had read since childhood, but upon which Ihad never expected to look.

Some years ago, PunditaRamabai, a high-caste Indian, a widow, and daughterof a Brahmin priest, became interested in the widowsof India, and never rested till she had established ahome for them.Ramabai is the most remarkablewoman that India has ever produced.Her father,contrary to custom, believed in the education of wo-men, whether wives or daughters. He educated hiswife and she assisted in the education of the daughter,who felt she had a special mission to go from houseto house and arouse an interest in the education ofwomen. This prevented her marriage until the unu-sual age of sixteen, something almost unknown amongShe married a lawyer, but in littlethose people.252INDIA.more than a year and a half he died, leaving herShe felt the sting ofbranded for the rest of her life.this so bitterly that her reason, her judgment, toldher that there was something wrong in a system thatbranded a widowed woman and made her an object ofShe decided to go to Europe and see whatcontempt.the life of a woman in the Christian world was like.With her little girl, very young, she arrived in thegreat city of London, among people of whose tongueshe knew nothing ; but she learned the language,came to America, and raised a very large sum ofmoney for her Widows' Home.While in Powain I visited this fine institution,where I found forty-seven widows, some of them sosmall and young that it would be supposed thatnatural human kindness would have led to their pro-tection ; but they were despised, abused and evencast away, until the kind-hearted Ramabai gatheredthem in and cared for them.Next to this remarkable woman, among those whohave come out a benefactor to their people is MissSoonderbai Powai, who has gone to England to pleadwith a Christian nation to come to the rescue of thepeople of India and deliver them from the withering,blighting curse of opium-smoking.In crossing India I stopped at Jeypoor and visitedthe palace of the Rajah, who was very kind.
