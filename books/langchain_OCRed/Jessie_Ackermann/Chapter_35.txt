CHAPTER  IIIDISPOSAL OF THE DEAD IN SIAM AND INDIA.jHE sights of China prepared me for anythingI might see in other parts ; therefore I wasnot shocked when I reached Siam andlearned that the poor of that country, when dead,were thrown to the vultures. A large place in oneof the temple grounds is set aside as the spot to whichthe common dead are brought.In company with alady I drove to one of these grounds, but on enteringa native told us the dead had not yet been brought.Because of the intense heat it is a law that the deadmust be disposed of within twenty-four hours ; and asdeath usually occurs at night the early morning findsevery preparation made for the final disposition of thebody. We had reached the grounds a little early,but the time was profitably spent in conversation witha most intelligent native, who spoke English verywell. He conducted us over the grounds and throughSoonthe temple, explaining everything of interest.a messenger came to us to say that a Chinese haddropped dead in the gambling-house over the way,and would soon be brought in. On his person moneyenough was found to pay for the wood, and his re-mains were to be cremated. As we walked towardthe gateway we saw geyeral men carrying a rough pine316ORIENTAL OBSEQUIES.317box covered with a red blanket ; this was placed toone side in a sheltered spot, and the men began prepa-rations for cremation. From one corner of the groundthey brought quantities of wood, split in the usuallength for a stove ; a high, long pile was arranged,and before the box was removed to the pile, the na-tives asked if we cared to see the dead Chinaman.We walked over to the box, the red blanket was re-moved, and we saw that the friendless man had beenpacked away with his few eflfects, all of which were tobe consigned to the fire. The cover was replaced,and box, blanket and all were lifted upon the pile.A match was touched to the wood, the pyre waswrapped in clouds of smoke, and long tongues offlame soon reduced all to a small pile of ashes.Meantime some of the dead Siamese had beenbrought in, having been carried through the streetsin an entirely nude condition on a rough plank borneon the shoulders of the natives. To prevent the re-mains from falling into the street, runners had keptbeside the plank to replace a limb or arm upon theboard as it was jolted from its resting-place by themotion of the bearers.Beside the spot reserved forburning the dead was a small square, fenced ofi" bya solid brick wall some four feet high.Within thisa still smaller space was marked ofi" by a row ofbricks, and in the second inclosure the dead werePerched on the fence and on the eavesdisposed of.of the temple sat a row of solemn-faced vultures,waiting for their prey.

When the body has been reducedto ashes, a golden vase, in the form of the king'sdecoration on his umbrella, is brought in and thesacred dust deposited in the vessel, which is placedin one of the rooms of the palace beside other vasescontaining similar relics of the dead. The buildingsare then torn down, and the imperial family put onmourning and make the usual display of grief.In the vast country of India the dead are disposedof according to the religious belief that prevails indifferent parts of the country. The Brahmins burn(This custom I havetheir dead in public places.referred to on pages 231-233). The Mohammedansbury them and place a heavy, flat stone over the grave.And the Parsees, the most intelligent of all the peo-ple of Asia, and, I should say, the most highly edu-cated, build great towers, within which the dead areplaced, to be devoured by the ever-present vulture.The Parsees, who came over from Persia some fewcenturies ago, h^ve settled in great numbers in the;ORIENTAL OBSEQUIES.319Bombay presidency.In their energy in carrying oncommercial pursuits they outdo, if anything, the He-Their steady application to business has madebrew.them the leaders of trade in that presidency.Settlingthere in early days, they brought with them the pe-culiar custom of disposing of their dead that had beenhanded down to them through all the centuries, andprobably will be practiced through the coming ages.One of the most beautiful spots along the coast,without the city of Bombay, is the site of the Parsee"Towers of Silence." A very high stone wall sur-rounds the entire grounds, which include some acresthe whole is laid out like a beautiful and extensivepark, and well in toward the center stand the threeJust why they are called towers would betowers.hard to say, for they are more like unroofed roundhouses.

The bottom is very deep and extends somehundreds of feet into the earth. The oldest tower hasbeen in use for two hundred and fifty years.Thesegrounds are the home of the vultures, and at any time320ORIENTAL OBSEQUIES.of the day and night they can be seen in numbersperched upon the top of the towers and along theedge of the fence. They stand perfectly motionless,and as they are huddled one against the other it iseasy to mistake them for the parapet of the towers.Their long, gray plumage, well dressed and trimmed,has almost the effect of polished stone, and for a mo-ment I mistook them for an ornamental finish to thestructures.By securing a pass from the authorities the groundsmay be visited at stated hours. The funerals takeplace at given times, and no foreigner is then allowedin the grounds ; even the Parsee women are excludedfrom attendance. One day, when the heat was almostpast endurance, I was invited to drive out and viewNothing but my great desire tothe place.fullyunderstand the Parsee burial customs would havetempted me from the house, but such is human thirstafter knowledge (to say nothing of curiosity) thateven the scorching glare of old Sol became a matterof little moment.Casting aside every garment thatcould well be disposed of, I borrowed a gentleman'scork hat to prevent sunstroke, or, as they say in thatcountry, "a touch of the sun," and started along thebeach in the direction of the "Towers of Silence."Ascending the steps we were confronted by a signprinted in the English language, which warned us notto be found on the grounds after a certain hour.Inresponse to a ring of the bell, the porter opened thegate ; our passes were examined, and we walked intot;he corridor, where a miniature tower was explainedORIENTAL OBSEQUIES.323chatty individual. We passed into theby thisgrounds, and the little Parsee lady who accompaniedme fairly gasped for breath as I hurled handfuls ofinterrogation-points at her, and wrote down her cheer-ful information in my note-book. The time passedfaster than I had thought ; indeed I was so interestedin this little woman's explanation that I took no noteof time, and when the funeral hour came around wefound that we were locked in the grounds. The ring-ing of the bell and a knock at the gate remindedme that a funeral procession was about to enter.Idid not know what the penalty might be for thisintrusion, which on my part was quite unintentional,but I resolved to " stand ground" and face it out.My friend suggested that we quietly retreat, and seekthe entrance by a less frequented path, but " retreat "does not figure largely in my make-up.I hastilysettled in my own mind a plan of action. From longassociation with all ranks and conditions of men, Ihave learned that a good way of escape out of a dif-ficulty is to smile one's way through.I steppedtoward the porter with as much of a smile as thesolemnity of the occasion warranted, and in penitenttones expressed my deep regret at having transgressedthe law, but suggested that, as I was already in for-bidden grounds, it would be much better to remain ;and, placing a coin in his hand, I seated myself whereI could command a full view of the procession.Those who attended the funeral drove up in car-riages, but the remains were brought through thestreets on a bamboo litter, the poles resting on the3*54ORIENTAL OBSEQUIES.shoulders of two front and rear bearers, and the sideson those of four marching between the front and rearmen. As they reached the steps, the bearers of thedead headed the procession. They wore long, whitedresses that fell from their neck to the ground, andwere girded at the waist with a sash of the sameThe fingers of each hand were boundmaterial.about with white gauze, and a mitten of the samegoods was pulled over the hands.This was to pre-vent any possible contact with the unclothed dead, forthe remains were only covered with a sheet.

This strange procession moved slowly towardthe tower. The iron doors on the side had beenopened and a ladder placed before it. Up this thepriest made his way, and the remains were handed tohim, that he might place them upon the grating ; thisdone, the little yellow dog, which protested loudly,was also handed up and placed in the tower for a fewmoments. The sheet was removed, the dog handeddown, the descent of the priest was accomplished, thepall-bearers drew from their fingers the wrappings,and the iron doors were shut.
