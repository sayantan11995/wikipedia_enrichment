The signs were faint, but sure.

Onreaching the island, however, it was discovered thatshe belonged to some different order, and she wasthus prevented from carrying out her long- cherishedplan of bringing blessing to the lives of the uncared-for of that desolate spot.South and west of this group of islands the SouthSeas are dotted with similar groups, varying only aIt wasfew degrees in climate, and tropical scenery.my intention to visit these groups on a missionarysteamer, and spend a whole season cruising about thePacific ; but news came to us of swells, squalls and aI had hadgeneral disturbed condition of the sea."swell " enough in getting to Honolulu, so I resolvedto continue my journey to New Zealand and later onreturn to the islands.On this return trip (to make somewhat of a longdigression) we were all delighted to welcome as pas-sengers Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson, the late nov-elist, and part of his family— his wife and her daugh-ter. The passengers were few, and in the journey oftwo weeks I saw much of this interesting trio.Mr.Stevenson had been to New Zealand for a breath ofcool air in the hope of a general return of strength.From his looks I was of the opinion that his visit hadbeen in vain ; and yet he had no thought of anything66THE SAND WICH ISLANDS.less than entertaining the world for years with his pen,from which flowed so much that told us of the won-derful genius of the man.lyike his books, he borethe stamp of genius, and had I not known who he was' There is a man who can say,I should have said, '' I am part of all I have seen.'"As I looked at and studied him from time to timeduring the voyage, I felt sad indeed to see the phys-ical wreck that was overtaking him.There is some-thing about the silent fading away of a genius thatmakes us feel that others less useful should be theones to be borne down the stream.
