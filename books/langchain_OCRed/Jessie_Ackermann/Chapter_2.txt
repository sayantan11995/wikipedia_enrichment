The girl childrenwho are allowed to live meet with a worse fate thanthat of being choked to death with grass.Often,while still infants, they are given away to their futurehusbands ; or, if kept at home until they are ten ortwelve years of age, they are sold for a few blanketsAbout this age a girl is supposed toor merchandise.reach womanhood, and is regarded unfit to mingleShe is confined in a dark room,with the family.sometimes for a year, but in some sections for onlythree months, and is seen by no one but her mother.On emerging from this long confinement her lowerlip is pierced, and a bone or ivory ornament inserted,very much as Tamil women pierce their ears anddraw the lobe down with heavy metals.While still young the poor creature often undergoesthe painful process of tattooing.

The estimation in whichthey are held by men has been voiced by one of thechiefs, who said, " Women are made to labor ; one ofthem can haul as much as two men can. They pitchour tents and mend our clothing."On the Upper Yukon a man buys his wives just asa white man buys his cattle.If he has wood to cutor haul, or much heavy labor to perform, he increasesthe number of wives instead of purchasing beasts ofburden. They are regarded from the stand-point of" a good investment," and only such care is bestowedupon them as will prevent a " depreciation of value,"or keep them up to the best service, which, of course,means the heaviest labor.In times of war, the men captured are usuallykilled, but the lives of the women are spared ; theyhave a value in the labor market. They sometimesfall to the ownership of men who are most unmercifulin their treatment of them. A master's power overit is often a dying command thatthem is unlimited ;several slaves shall be killed that he may have someone to wait on him in the next world.The most inhuman treatment these women have toALASKA.27bear is to be cast out of their houses at a time whenthey should have the tenderest care, and suffer alonetne most awful agony known to woman.Frequentlyboth the mother and child die from neglect.' home 'The word '' is unknown to these people.

The absence of hotels made it necessary to carryour provisions, even to a suspicious looking jug—con-taining cold tea. We were laden almost like camels.The trail led us over the mountains, through a denseforest, and beyond rushing streams and dashing water-falls that seemed to sing an anthem of praise to theMost High as they hurried on to swell the rolling tideof the dark blue ocean. We sat down on a great rockto rest, but the grandeur of the surroundings sooncaused us to forget our fatigue, and we continued toclimb, lost to everything but a sense of the vastnessand greatness of the scenery.

On one pole can be seen the face of awhale, a raven, a wolf and an eagle ; the lowest figureindicates to what tribe the grandfather of the occu-pant of the house, on his mother's side, belongs.The whole forms a genealogical record of the family,the child taking the totem of the mother.Beside thedivision of these people into the tribes, they are sub-divided into families, each of which has its badge, or32ALASKA.totem.

The house was without apartments, and thelarge room answered all the purposes of kitchen, bed-room and sitting-room.In the middle of the room,under the opening in the roof, was a small fire, aroundwhich sat the family, and I should say, their cousins,uncles and aunts, for they live in a very promiscuousmanner, often as many as twenty occupying oneroom.
