CHAPTER  III.FROM SWATOW TO SHANGHAI.IFTER some time I returned to Swatow toembark for the far North, but not until Ihad seen something of one of the customsof the country in which I was deeply interested.Iwas the guest of a missionary whose husband is atthe head of a large hospital in which thousands ofIt occurred to mewomen are treated every year.that here was the opportunity to see something of theway in which the feet of the women are made small.I was told that the women had the greatest objectionto showing their feet, and my friend, who had workedamong them eleven years, had never found a womanwho was willing to remove the bandages ; but, never-theless, we decided to go through the hospital insearch of some woman who would accommodate us inthis respect, and fortune favored us. We came toone whose feet had been bound for forty years.Sheexpressed a willingness, if taken to an apartment byherself, to remove the bandages.In a small room,seated on the floor, she unwound the strip of cloththat for years had compressed her feet into the small-est possible size, and revealed a horrid sight.Ithas been supposed by many that the feet of Chinese151152CHINA.women are made to retain their diminutive propor-tions by encasing them in wooden or iron shoes ; butsuch means have never been used. The feet are allmade small by binding. A child is taken at an earlyage, and a narrow bandage, about an inch arid a halfwide and two yards long, is bound about the feet.One end is placed on the instep and brought over allthis bandage is drawnthe toes but the great toe ;with such force that it pulls the toes to the sole of theViewing the mutilatedfoot where they finally grow.foot from above no toes can be seen, and even whenthe sole is examined only the outline can be traced,for they are pressed in even with the sole of the foot.The bandages are never removed except to replacethem with clean ones.I saw a child about ten years old whose parents,requiring her services about the house, had not boundher feet until she had reached the age mentioned.The poor creature could not walk ; she was carriedabout on the shoulders of natives, and in all proba-bility it would be two years before she could bear herweight on her feet. The common women, who hewwood and draw water, or work in the fields, do nothave their feet subjected to this treatment. The bind-ing unfits the feet for any kind of service, hence itmust be confined to the "better classes."I haveseen a full-grown Chinawoman, bedecked in silk andrichest satin, unable to walk across the room withoutHer feet were butthe aid of a servant or a staff.three inches long 1It is almost impossible to learn when or how thisCHINA.153custom was introduced ; constant inquiry at everyreliable source failed to throw light on its origin.Inthe palace the practice is not carried on. The preseniruler, being a descendant of the Tartars, has neverallowed this curiously cruel " fashion " to make havocamong the women of his household.Before leaving Swatow I crossed to the other side ofthe bay to visit the great Baptist Mission station.

The Chinese never attempt to save a drowningperson ; they have some superstition about rescuingpeople from the water ; and for awhile it seemed asthough we were destined to perish. Very fortunately,however, a Turkish man-of-war had put into the har-bor some time before, and in taking a survey of thebay with its great search-light, saw our overturnedjunk. The life-boats had been lowered when the ves-sel anchored ; and seeing our distress some Turkssped to the rescue, and we were taken in safety to the154CHINA.shore. The next morning we sent messages of thanksto the captain, and a copy of the Bible to each of theIn over one hundred and fifty thousand milessailors.of travel this was the only accident that ever befellme at sea.We had decided to defer our visit to Shanghai untilthe Decennial Conferences, which were to take placein a short time. A number of missionaries from thesouth were also to attend, and for the sake of goodcompany I decided to wait and travel with them. Atthe appointed day about forty, as jolly a crowd asTheyever traveled 'under sail, started northward.represented many lands and every shade of religiousbelief, but all were bent on having a good time. Maymorning dawned bright and beautiful. To keep upthe old-time custom of choosing and crowning a queenwe decided to elect her majesty by popular vote. Atall gentleman traveling with us, who was somewhatshocked at the " unconfined joy " of the missionaries,took it upon himself to maintain the dignity of theparty. To encourage him in his praiseworthy motives,and show him how much we appreciated his presence,some of the fun-loving girls proposed that he be thechosen one. The ballots were passed around and hewas unanimously elected.In mid-ocean there waslittle facility for weaving a garland fair for the noblebrow of the male queen, but the ready wit of one ofthe young ladies came to the rescue.Scraps of rib-bons were clipped from our garments, the crown wasdecorated with many colors, and in a fitting speechthe dignified gentleman was proclaimed '' Queen '' ofCHINA.155the May.All on board participated in the spirit ofthe hour, and when night came we were the betterable to sleep for the lively enjoyment of the day.The steamer was a grand vessel of the French mailFrom the time it started out from the moonlitline.harbor it never gave a lurch, but for two days plowednobly through a heavy sea, with the wind blowing aIn good time we anchored at the mouthperfect gale.of the Whangpoo river, where we were taken aboarda tender, and two hours later we reached the city.The change from southern to northern China wasvery great.

The river was alivewith all sorts of craft , propelled by oars, canvas orsteam. From the masts, sails and sides of these ves-sels floated flags and banners, for this was the Chineseday of days â€” New Year.It was a pretty sight, asthese gayly bedecked boats passed each other beatinggreat gongs, waving flags in salutation and wishingeach other good luck for the ensuing year.The river front of Shanghai, peopled chiefly withforeigners, has been beautified until nothing morecould be desired in the way of elegant surroundings.This section of the city has been set aside for theFrench, English, Americans and Germans, each form-ing a community of itself, but all living in mostfriendly relations. The city proper is surrounded by156CHINA.a parapeted wall forty feet high, and is reachedthrough lofty gateways which at oue time could beentered only at certain hours, and then a countersignwas required.It is one of the greatest cities inNorthern China. On the day of our arrival thestreets were in holiday attire, and the people, arrayedin their best clothes, gave themselves up to pleasureand worship.

The children were, doubtless, unwel-come girls who had been thrown from some of theboat-houses into the river, and the rising tide had leftthem on the bank ; they were probably washed intothe stream again to be borne by the onsweeping tideto the open sea.
