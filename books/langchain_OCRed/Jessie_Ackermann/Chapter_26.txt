CHAPTER  II.SIGHTS IN CALCUTTA AND BENARES.^^^UR point of landing was Calcutta, anythingj M but a native city. The whites are foundhere in such numbers that the whole cityhas a western appearance.It is full of interest, how-I visited Thackeray's birthplace ; the roomever.where Macaulay wrote his wonderful essays ;thechurch where Carey first preached, and the baptis-tery where Judson was baptized.I then went outto see the native town.It was at a very good time to visit the outlyingcity, for the " holy fathers" were just making a pil-grimage to the Hooglj^ one of the sacred rivers ofThese men belong to the Brahmin faith, andIndia.are supposed to be absolutely holy ; their whole timeis given up to religious rites—reading holy booksafter hour.

As he descends the steps and dips himself be-neath the water, he is happy in the thought that hehas accomplished a twofold purpose — cleansed hisbody and paid homage to the stream.While this was going on at the water's edge, justabove, on the bank, I witnessed scenes never to beforgotten. The highest hope of the Hindu is to dieIn one place couldin sight of the sacred stream.be seen hundreds of men and women afflicted withevery disease that could be named, and in every stageof death. One old man, in a dying condition, wasbeing borne to the brink by his friends. They reachedthere just as he was about breathing his last, and thathe might know the blessing of a final look at theriver, a young woman rushed to his side, and withher fingers held his eyelids open until the last sparkof life had fled.This sight of poor, wretched, igno-rant humanity, as looked upon on that spot, filledme with a sense of gratitude for the blessing of birthin a Christian land.At one edge of the city is a spot set aside for dis-It has been the custom of theposing of the dead.232INDIA.Brahmins, so far as we have any record of theirmethods, to dispose of the dead by burning, and thevery primitive way in which this is done makes itsee'm terrible.Five or six bodies lay at the river's edge with theirfeet in the water, while, above, the preparations forSpecial men aredisposing of them were in progress.engaged, who go at their work very much as theyFour heavy iron rodswould in building a house.are driven in the ground, about six feet apart oneLogs of wood are piled upway and four the other.on this space to a height of about four feet, the re-mains are placed on the pile, and other wood makesSitting or standing near are thethe pyre complete.numerous hired mourners and the relatives.

The whole scene is far beyond de-scription. The long flights of stairs leading into thestream, crowded with bathers repeating prayers, thedead and dying, the cry of beggars, the wail ofmourners, the awful sound of the music, the crackingof the fire, and the dark clouds of curling smoke, allmade a bewildering, confusing scene from which I wasglad to turn, only to find things equally shocking.Mounting the stone steps, I soon reached the streetspf the city, and found my way to the leading temples,INDIA.233The first was the Monkey Temple.Here hundredsof these creatures are cared for and almost worshipedby the natives, who regard them as sacred. My nextvisit was to the Cow Temple. The cow is also helda sacred animal by these people, and this temple, setaside for their special care, is of real oriental splendorand design, highly ornamented inside and out. Thelower floor is set aside for the cows, and I found itjust like an ordinary stable, only special care is be-Hundreds of worshipersstowed upon the animals.At one end is a shrine for thevisit the place daily.only image the Brahmins have.It represents threegods in one, and is the most hideous thing that couldWorshipers come early in thepossibly be imagined.morning with young kids to sacrifice to this god.The poor little creatures are tied up by the hind legs,hung against the wall, their throats cut, and theirblood thrown before the idol ; then the worshiperbathes in the Ganges near by. The noise, talk, run-ning and pushing against each other, and the absenceof all influences that lead to a worshipful frame ofmind, are the most noticeable features of the lowerpart of the temple. The upper part is set aside forwomen who are married to the god, which means thatthey are set aside as the special property of the holyThese women are either widows—the de-spised of India—or young girls who have been soldby parents whose love for money is greater than theirlove for their children.fathers.
