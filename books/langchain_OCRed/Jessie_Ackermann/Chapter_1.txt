CHAPTER  I.SOME REMARKS ON ENGI.ISH-SPEAKING WOMEN.|HIS chapter, though seemingly irrelevant tothe narrative of my wanderings in far-oflflands, is penned with a distinct object inview. What this object is will shortly be made ap-parent to the patient reader.Woman has always been an object of interest,doubtless because she "dates so far back."In allages, men have tried to tell, in story and song, thecharms, graces and virtues of woman. We canscarcely turn over a page of ancient or modern liter-ature without reading her praises.Someone has said, "God's last, best and greatestgift to the first man was woman ;'' and another," The earth was sad, the garden was a wild ;And man, the hermit, sighed, till woman smiled."I have seen somewhere, a word picture of the firstman. He paced the garden up and down ; walkedbeside the rippling stream ; listened to the music ofthe wind among the rustling leaves, and the song ofthe wild bird ; but his soul was not satisfied, and tocomplete Creation was wrought a masterpiece"God's last, best and greatest gift to the first man."81ALASKA.These are beautiful tributes to " the sex whosepresence civilizes man," as Cowper has it ; but howfew of us realize that such sentiments have signifi-cance for about only one-fourth of the women of theworld !English-speaking women are the recipients of morecourtesy and greater civility than those of any otherrace or tongue. We meet a gentleman, and as amark of respect he bares his head—we expect him todo it. We enter a crowded room or car, and a gen-tleman at once rises to give us his seat.It is ac-cepted—sometimes without rendered thanks, I amsorry to say,—as a matter of course, a courtesy dueYet with all this deference shown us, andour sex.all manner of attentions bestowed upon us, there arereally few contented English-speaking women. Weare alway longing to be something we are not ; reach-ing for things just beyond our grasp ; trying to climbto heights we can never attain.This longing, yearn-ing, climbing, or trying to climb, has led to a greatunrest among womankind. The air is electric with it,and in these days it has taken the form of the " NewWoman." Next will come the "New Girl"; withthese developments the "Old Man" and the "OldBoy " will have a lively chase to keep up with womanin the race of life. The outgrowth of all this "reach-' seems to be an increasing discontent amonging out 'women,I have just completed a second tour of the world.It covered a period of six years, and during this timeI traveled the great distance of one hundred and fiftyALASKA.19I was a guest in nearly two thou-thousand miles.sand homes ; all kinds of homes, rich and poor, highand low—from the palace, government house andcastle to the thatched cot of the sturdy farmer, thecanvas or tin tent of the miner, and the bark hut ofthe lumber camp.I have seen life in all its variedforms, and under every condition, and I have foundfew really contented women, so few that they couldbe counted on my fingers.Let me illustrate.What is the matter with these women, do you ask ?I go to one houseEverything.where everything is beautiful and lovely.Surely, Ithink, this must be a "heaven to go to heaven in."After I have been there a few days I express myappreciation of my surroundings." What a pleasanthome you havel" I say. The good woman is fullyconscious that little could be added, either of comfortor adornment, and she replies, '' Yes, I can have any-thing I want for my home ; I sometimes think I neverhave a chance to express a wish concerning it ; everywant is anticipated."Here she draws a long breath and continues, " Butyou know it takes more than a house to make awoman happy. I don't suppose you ever heard—no, Idon't suppose you have—but my husband—well, allI have to say is, if you know when you are well off,With this woman I found thedon't ever marry."house perfect, but the husband a little wrong.I takeher advice and go on my way.The next house in which I am a guest is a small,six-room cottage. The woman seems perfectly happy,20ALASKA.."' loveliest husband !She thinksfor she has the 'the Lord never created but just one man, and he isAll his virtues are enumerated ; she tells howhers.he is the " chief pillar and prop in every good enter-prise," and proceeds to give me a little advice, which" If there is another man in the worldI do not take.like my husband, I should say ' Get married to-mor-row.' "But she, too, heaves a deep sigh, and fairlywails out "It's an awful thing, though, to be com-pelled to live in a small house. When I was a girlwe had plenty of room, but here we cannot have evenone guest. We wanted to entertain you, but reallyhad no place to put you ;it is almost like living in ahen-coop." Here the husband is almost perfect—justfaults enough to class him as a human being—but thehouse !Oh, the house !My observations have not been confined to theseabodes. One day I am being entertained in a lovelyhome, where I am the guest of a most gifted woman.Seeing she has large means and special talents, I tryto interest her in some department of Christian work,but she exclaims, " For goodness sake don't ask meto do anything outside of my house 1 Do you know II told the good woman I washave ten children?"fully aware of this fact, and reminded her of the sixHer reply filled me with thanksgiving thatservants.I have never had six servants to manage."Yes, butthe servants are worse than the children ; betweenthem I have no peace of mind or rest of body !Ittakes me half my time to keep the coachman fromfussing with the gardener, and the other half to settleALASfCA.disputes between the cook and housemaids."ask me to do anything outside of my house !21Don'tI leave this poor soul, burdened with the care of tenchildren and the direction of six servants, and tarry inthe house of a sad-faced woman who has neither"chick nor child " upon which to bestow her tenderShe goes into the yard, looks over the fence,care.and sees these ten romping, laughing, happy children.In despair she exclaims, "Well, husband, how do j^ouaccount for it that the neighbors have all the blessingsin life, and we have none? "In one house it is toomany children, in the other it is no children, andneither of the women is satisfied.The greatest curiosity in the form of a discontentedwoman remains yet to be described.She was of the" New Woman " order.Her family consisted of twobeautiful children and "a most desirable husband."She was interested in my travels, the work and theworld generally.After a short conversation with her,she clasped her hands and exclaimed, " Oh, what acareer ; how lovelj' it must be ! Do you know I havealways felt I should have had a mission in the world ;this housekeeping is such a tame life!"Just think of a woman with a husband and twoIf I had only thechildren looking for a mission !husband, I should think I had the biggest mission onI would never look for a greater. A womanearth.with home, husband and children looking for a mis-sion in this world is far beyond my limited powers ofcomprehension.22ALASKA.I have tried to illustrate from my observations thediscontented state of women who enjoy privileges andopportunities unknown to so large a portion of ourIf every English-speaking woman could leavesex.her country, and go through the lands where womanexists only as a slave, or, at most, as a "necessaryevil," I am sure she would return contented with herShe would not pray for greater opportunities,lot.but for " much wisdom " to make the best use of thoseshe has.We of America need not leave our own shores tocontrast our happy condition with the position of ourIt is only because of the broaderless favored sisters.range of vision that has come to us in these last yearsthat woman in some parts of our own country hasbeen released from the degradation of slavery, andelevated to the dignity of womanhood.In this en-lightened day we are astonished that our higher civil-ization has not made itself felt in the release of thewomen of the far North—Alaska—from a slaverywhich means not only controlling the labor of theirhands, but a right to sell or rent their bodies.
