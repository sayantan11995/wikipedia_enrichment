CHAPTER  IV."THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT."rA|S MIGHT be expected in a land where thewill of man is law in the household, divorcesare very easy to obtain in Japan. The hus-band has almost unlimited power.According to thelaw a man may put aside his wife for any one of sevenreasons : First, if she is disobedient to her parents-in-law ; second, if she be barren ; third, if she be lewd orlicentious ; fourth, if she be jealous ; fifth, if she have aloathsome or contagious disease ; sixth, if she stealseventh, if she talk too much. The husband being thesole judge in the matter, these seven reasons could bemade to serve in almost any case. The divorced wifehas no legal claim to support, but must devise someway to take care of herself.Under no circumstancesor plea can a woman get a divorce from her husband.Polygamy, wherever found, or however modified, isIn Japan a man has but oneShe is retained if she presents her hus-legal wife.band with the children he desires ; if not, this is sufii-cient reason for divorce.If he does not divorce her,by common consent, and with her assistance in theselection, he takes one or two " handmaids " into hishousehold, the legal wife retaining her position ashead of the house.If she assists in selecting the" handmaid," it is said the wife is never jealous.an unmitigated curse.A Japanese Lady."125JAPAN.While there are many things in the surroundings ofthese women which make us feel how vastly better offthey are than many others, yet a real searching intosocial conditions reveals a state of affairs hardly inkeeping with their advancement.

Some idea may be gathered fromMr. Humbert's writing of the terrible surroundingsinto which these women are sometimes led :" Whither goes that poorly dressed woman, holdingby hand a young girl only seven years of age, deckedAfter an hour's walk sheout in her best clothes?reaches the external wall of the city of vice, accessibleonly on the one sideâ€”that of the north.She has metno woman on the way.
