CHAPTER  II.A GLIMPSE OF NATIVE LIFE.|HE women of Japan are small— I should saythe smallest of the Orient—their averageheight being only four feet sixinches.They are very graceful, have clear skin, and hairin which they take special pride—as black as araven's wing. The hair is arranged three times aweek, add always requires the assistance of a barber.Even then the process of oiling, gluing and packingthe hair into a great pile must tax the time andpatience of these women beyond all measure.I was greatly interested, one day, watching a Jap-Sheanese lady undergoing this form of martyrdom.sat on the floor before a small mirror fastened to theThe bureautop of what we would call a toy bureau.contained three drawers, in which were kept her arti-cles of toilet—powder, oil, wax and tooth-paste.

The use of window-glass isalmost unknown, except among the wealthy, whohave copied English architecture. The floors arecovered with matting, invariably clean, for neitherclog nor shoe is permitted to come in contact withit—they are left outside. The mats are always of acertain size ; a house or piece of land is said to be " somany mats square."These mats are made of rawstraw, very skillfully plaited, with a smooth, closeupper side. The partitions in the houses are notwalls, but sliding screens, which run on grooves, andextend about two-thjrds of the distance to the ceiling.a114JAPAN.When they are pushed back the whole house isthrown into one large room, which is perfectly desti-tute of furniture.
