CHAPTER  I.THE MIKADO.—JAPANESE CHARACTERISTICS.IHE world generally is applauding the brav-ery, courage and pluck of the Japanese.Whole volumes are being written to recordtheir valiant deeds, and the daily press sounds theirSo, I turn back the pages ofpraises far and near.my note-book to read my impressions of the race andcountry derived from personal observation.The women of Yokohama expected me to reachtheir shores on a certain day, and appointed a com-mittee to go, off to the ship to welcome me andescort me to the capital. We anchored one morningWhile engaged inabout a mile from the wharf.preparation to go ashore I heard someone ask if IGoing on deck I found aboutwere a passenger.twenty Japanese ladies waiting to greet me, and seethat I landed in safety. They were accompanied byone solitary man, who announced that he had cometo welcome me on behalf of his countrymen. TheJapanese are so polite, and possessed of such grace ofmanner that they are frequently called the French oflOOJAPAN.Special attention is paid to foreign ladies ;the East.nothing is left undone that can add to their comfort.This gentleman heard that I had been seasick duringthe voyage, so he made me his charge in landing.As I was about to cross the deck he ofifered his armto conduct me down the steps into the boat.I tow-ered nearly two feet above him, and as I stoopeddown to take his arm my only thought — whichamounted to a fear— was, if I should fall upon thisman he never would know what killed him ; but wereached the wharf in safety. A hurried drive broughtus to the station, whence in a few minutes we werewhirling northward toward the capital.The journey was a delightful one, surrounded bythese charming, modest little women, who looked onme as a born curiosity. The railroad passed througha beautiful valley ; one side was hemmed in by tower-ing hills, and the other stretched down to the water'sedge. The air was soft and balmy, and the tide wasout, so there was no splash and dash of the waves asthey now and then kissed the sandy beach, rollingback again to gather force for another caress. Thevoice of the sea was scarcely more than a gentlemurmur that came like a soothing lullaby to theweary traveler.Traveling is much slower here than in England orAmerica, and has a decided advantage in giving thetraveler a chance to see as he goes. Thus we jour-neyed on, skirting the beach until Tokio was reached,the capital of the empire and the home of the Mi-kado.JAPAN.101At this particular time, when the eye of the worldis on the victorious sons of Japan, who are makinghistory toward which the unnumbered hosts of thefuture will point with pride, there stands out amongthe brave, heroic and progressive spirits one of themost striking characters of the century.Unless onehas visited the far East, and made one's self familiar byobservation with the peculiar surroundings that havefrom time immemorial hedged in the rulers of theseconservative lands, it is hardly possible to understandjust what the progressive spirit of the Emperor ofJapan means.When the Mikado came to the throne of his fathers,the one hundred and twenty-first ruler of his line —for he claims an unbroken descent from JummuTerno, Son of Heaven, who ruled 660 B. C.— he wasonly sixteen years of age. He had lived the life towhich imperial princes for ages have been restricted,and had positively no knowledge of the world, andlittle foundation for character that must lead, and atthe same time rule, forty millions of people.At thattime the Mikado was supposed to be the spiritualleader of the people, rather than the ruler, the Sho-guns really possessing the temporal power. Somecenturies ago the military leaders, styling themselvesTycoons, assumed the power of government, leavingonly titular honors to the emperor. The Tycoonsruled with a high hand until Mutso Hito came to thethrone, when there was a general demand on the partof his subjects that war be waged with the Tycoons,who had so long kept the real ruler in the back-102JAPAN.Therefore it was that in 1868, when onlyground.seventeen years of age, out stepped this boy rulerinto the nineteenth century sunlight of progress, andbrought about the subjection of the Tycoons, whoretired into the quietude of private life ; and thus thecomplete restoration of power to the emperor tookplace.The spirit of reform was born in the new ruler.Ina short time he received the representatives of othercountries, being the first emperor who ever sat inThree years later he sent a commis-state council.sion of fift3 picked men around the world to studysystems of education, and western art and science.He was especially favorable to the education of wo-Realizing that much of real character-moldingmen.devolves upon the mother, it seemed to him that thebetter education of woman would aid greatly in layinga sure foundation for the future progress of the nation.Less than two years after his accession Mutso Hitotook unto himself a noble woman to share the dutiesIn marriage the emperor is noof his high position.more allowed to make a love match than is his mean-est subject ; nor is he allowed to take his wife fromany branch of the imperial family ; she is chosen fromIm-the daughters of the five highest noble families.agine this youth, less than twenty years of age, stand-ing before a line of blushing maidens, of whom he haslittle knowledge, and looking them over much as hemight a stock of merchandise from which to select thematerial for a garment !

Theycertainly deserve the martyr's crown, and, indeed, Idoubt if that would be adequate compensation for thetorture inflicted by these unaccustomed garments.When I attended the Tokio dress reform society,and was asked to express an opinion concerning theintroduction of a new mode of attire, I was in doubtJAPAN.105for a few moments what to say.I looked at them intheir long, loose gowns with roomy sleeves, saw thatthey could trip about with a degree of grace, andcertainly with great comfort, and then I thought ofmy own manner of dress—of all the stringing, strap-ping, binding, lacing and hooking !

We weigh down our poor, tired bodies withas many pounds of cloth as we can carry, and loadour heads with cockades and feathers until we looktop-heavy and lop-sided ; then we go to the mirror,and the reflection so charms us that we exclaim' We are then in quite the proper' How lovely !frame of mind to hasten off to the benighted heathen,and preach to them of the higher civilization andwhat it has done for woman. They listen to ourwords, for they are astonished at our appearance, andsimply exclaim, " These poor barbarians ! Don't theyknow any better ?' pitying us from the bottom oftheir hearts.'''Aware of all this, my only reply to the Tokio dressreformers was, "Your costume is most comfortable.ro6-JAPAN. .and very becoming, and were I a Japanese lady Iwould always wear it." The women of Asia have suf-fered much from long established customs, but of onething, at least, they should ever be grateful to theirancestors — they have handed down from century tocentury, a style of dress in perfect keeping with thelaws of health and altogether modest in design.In comparing the Chinese with the Japanese theworld generally is very apt to overrate the latter.This is especially true at this moment when greatvictories have been achieved which seem to indicatethe superiority of the Japanese over his neighbor.Victory in war, however, is no criterion upon wiichto base our opinions of the people of these nations.While it is true that Japan has made great progress,and exhibited a spirit of willingness to adopt im-proved methods of government and throw the coun-try open to the world, it is by no means true that itJapan excelsis in every respect superior to China.in warfare ; but that, after all, is onl}'^ a relic of bar-barism, and modern methods of carrying on whole-sale murder and butchery surpass in barbarity any-thing known in the darkest ages.Hence I say, thefact that a nation is victorious in warfare indicatesComparing thelittle beyond power for organization.two countries from the stand-point of intellect I shouldsay the Chinaman stands first.In morals, it is a caseof " drawing straws " ; but for logic and philosophy,give me the Chinese.We of the West, who do not know these people intheir home lives, but judge of the whole race by theJAPAN.107scattering few who come to our shores, fail to recog-those who leave China are chieflynize this fact :coolies—very few of the better class, and none of theWith the Japanese ithigh-caste, leave their country.is just the reverse ; few go abroad to engage in thelower occupations ; and most of those who are foundwithin our borders are either here to attend schoolJapanese coolies are unknown.or carry on business.As a consequence we are constantly comparing thehigher class of Japanese with the coolie Chinese.Ihave lived in both countries ; I have journeyed awayfrom the beaten tracks of travel, and have had everyopportunity of judging the comparative merits of theIt is true that the Chinaman is slow totwo peoples.grasp an idea ; but when he comes to a decision it isbecause he has seen the philosophy of it, and fromthis follows a logical deduction from which it is al-most impossible to move him. The Japanese aremore emotional, and if their better self is appealedto they move at once ; but when the influence thathas affected them is withdrawn they usually slip backto old ways and methods.Because of this character-istic the missionaries do not know just how far tocount on them when Christian influence is removed.It is a conceded fact that the Japanese excel in brav-ery, as the recent war fully illustrates. The Chineseare known to be cowards, and have usually returnedSo deeply seated isfrom battle with trailing colors.this element of cowardice that such a thing as a greatChinese general will probably never be known.Perhaps it is just as well, for if ever they become aio8JAPAN.courageous, warlike people, with their uncounted mil-lions they would soon capture the world.The Japanese seem never to have drawn the linebetween time and eternity, and if it were not occasion-ally so exasperating, it would be really refreshing tomove among men and women who take time to live ;but when one goes rushing over the land, anxious tosee everything at once, and get away as soon as pos-sible, it is sometimes a great drain on one's reservedfund of grace to possess one's soul in peace and waitfor the slow action of the natives.It is impossible tohurry them ; you might just as well harness a snail,hoping to urge it into a gallop, as to try to impressit upon the Japanese that "time is money."The country is beautiful, and much of its beauty isdue to the fact of which I have just written ; theIt is nopeople take time to cultivate it properly.uncommon sight to see a man with a wooden ploughgoing over a small tract of land, and another follow-ing with grain, planting it in rows with as much careas we would set out cabbage or tomato plants. Onthe whole I should say that there is scarcely a race ofpeople who derive more real enjoyment from life thando the Japanese.—
