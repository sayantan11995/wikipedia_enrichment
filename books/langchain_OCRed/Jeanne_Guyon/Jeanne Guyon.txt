Piety, doubtless, therehas been, but of a shallow, superficial character, hardlyveiling a robust selfhood, which keeps its votaries inperpetual movement and fuss, and sends them runningover the world to pluck the motes out of brothers' eyes,forgetful of this great beam in their own. When doctorsand teachers with some knowledge of her writings doseriously mention her name, itis without exceptionapologetically and in a tone of patronizing superiority,which shows how much they have to learn both aboutthemselves and her.Putting aside for the moment all consideration of herviTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.heavenly exaltation, it may yet be seen, when the secretsof world hi>!tory are opened up, that her role as forerunnerof the moral and spiritual upheaval, which politicallypresents itself as the French Revolution, was no unim-The spiritual light which shone out from herportant one.through the darkness of France was not extinguished byher persecution ; and it may well be that to the latentunperceived working of that divine influence of which fora time she was the channel we owe the profound changeages.which distinguishes modern Europe from its precedingPerhaps George Sand's dying monk was not inerror when he hailed the overthrow of the altar at whosefoot he was killed by the preachers of Liberie, Erfalite,et Fraternite, as the opening of the Spirit's reign he hadBO long sighed for.No complete translation of Madame Guyon's auto-has,biographyever beenapparently,published,English.inOf those in the British Museum library thefullest is an abridged translation, published at Bristol, bysubscription, in 1772.

He writes" Among the different fakirs or pagan rcUcjieux there arethose who areJogees—that issay, saints,calledtoillumines, perfect, or perfectly united to the SovereignBeing—to the First and General Principle of all things.They are people who appear to have totally renounced theworld, and who ordinarily withdraw into some secludedgarden, like hermits, with a few disciples, who, modest andsubmissive, are only too happy to listen to them and servethem.If food is brought them they receive it ; if they areforgotten, it is said, they do without it, and that they liveby the grace of heaven in fasts and perpetual austerities,and are sunk in contemplation ; I say, sunk (ahimes), forthey enter so deeply therein, that, it is said, they passwhole hours ravished and in ecstasy.Their external sensesappear totally inert, and they maintain that they see theSovereign Being, as a living and indescribable Light, witha joy and satisfaction inexpressible, which is followed by acontempt and total detachment from the world. Now hereis the basis of the sect and the secret and mystery of theKabala, which I discovered only with great trouble andartifice.Their ancient books teach that the First Principleof things is altogether admirable, and that he is somethingvery pure (these are their own terms), very clear, and verysubtle ; that he is infinite, and can be neither engenderednor corrupted ;that he is the perfection of all things,TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.ixsovereignly perfect, and (what is to be remarked) in perfectrepose, in absolute inaction—in a word, in a perfectQuietism : for they hold that, being the origin and source ofall virtue, of all understanding, and all power (these arestill their terms), he has not, however, in himself eithervirtue, understanding, or power ; that, on the contrary, theproperty and sovereign perfection of his essence is to movenothing, to understand nothing, to apprehend nothing (rienagiter, rien entendre, rien apprendre).For this reason,whoever desires to be perfect, and to live happily and well,must by a continual contemplation and victory over him-self use all possible efforts to become similar to hisPrinciple, so that, having subdued and entirely extinguishedall human passions, he may be troubled or tormentedby nothing, and, after the manner of an ecstatic, entirelyabsorbed in profound contemplation, he may happily enjoythis Divine Repose, or Quietism, the happiest state of lifeone can wish." ^Two thousand years before Bernier, the Greeks ofAlexander's army had much the same to tell of theGymnosophists of India—whence doubtless the hermits ofThe Mussul-Egypt imported their ideas and practices.man mystics of Persia, of whom some account is to befound in Henry Martyn's Life, but the fullest informationin a recent book, Browne's "Year Among the Persians,"have evidently been fluttering round the same principle.This latesttraveller has the rare merit of trying tostudy his subject as a disciple from within, rather than asa critic from outside ; and we have to thank him for aSee Max Miiller's " Real Mabatma " iu the Nineteenth Century, Aug.1896, for accovint of a modern Jogee.—'XTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.translation from the Babi poetess, Karrat-ul-Ayn, in whichoccur the following lines :" The country of ' I ' and ' We ' forsake ;Thy home in Annihilation make :Since, fearing not this step to take.Thou shalt gain the highest felicity."In no dim or uncertain way, though superficially, themystic of India and of Persia has seen that the " Self-hood," that which makes each man regard himself as thecentre of the universe, and look out upon this universesolely in relation to, and as supplying nourishment for,the self-centre— what Goethe calls das verdamnte Ich,—isthe source of all human troubles, so that true happinesscan be reached only by the annihilation of this " Self-Then, centred on and animated by the Divinehood."Spirit, man shall resume his original and proper place, asa finite expression of Divine Love and Wisdom.It is the same truth essentially, but with the clearer lightthereon shed by Christ's life and sacrifice with its con-sequence, the help of the indwelling Paraclete, that thisautobiography sets forth and illustrates ; and thus we seehow true are Law's words, " There is but one salvation foraU mankind, and that is the Life of God in the Soul.

Where, then, Madame Guyon's story clashestherewith, the explanation may possibly be found, not in her inaccuracy, butin their inadequacy.TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.;xiiiThus in her years of darknessprogress towards results.she experienced the continued process of destruction andgradual mortification of that selfhood, which, drawn awayfrom every earthly object by the raptures of the DivineLove already poured into her, was yet nourishing itselffrom this food as a new form of spiritual selfhood.Thisdanger and the necessary course of remedy are largelydiscussed by St. John of the Cross in " The Obscure Nightof the Soul."In the same way, after the intimate spiritual union withFather La Combe, all the movements of his spirit (pneuma)were perceptible to her as movements of her own pneumabut that pneuma of hers was now identical with theSpirit of the Saviour living in her ; thus, by the infidelity ofFather La Combe, resisting and, as it were, pulling againstthe Saviour's attraction, her spirit was torn in differentdirections. Much that might otherwise seem difficult andobscure in what she tells will perhaps thus become in-telligible, by recognizing that, after her consummation inUnity with the Saviour, she enjoyed a distinct and fullperception of the operations of her spirit while actually inprogress.The tremendous vivacity of these we ordinarypersons, in our present state, can form no conception of.To this contrast it is probable our Saviour alludes when hesays, "If ye have not been faithful in that which is least,who will commit to your charge true riches ? " How canyou be trusted with your full-edged tools, while you showyourselves so maladroit or mischievous with the bluntones lent you for practice ? For it is never to be forgottenthat man is essentially pneuma, temporarily compelled tomanifest its life and activity through the limitations of—xivTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.psyche and body.Those who, on the death of the body,continue an existence under the limitations of the psyche,in a universe related thereto, as our physical universe isrelated to our physical organs, must yet, after a time, partwith that also, and enter, as pure pneuma, upon the eternalinheritance they have chosen for themselves—either a lifeof ravishing and triumphant joy with bliss indescribable,in a society where, Self extinguished, each one continuallyrealizes and manifests forth with an infinitevarietysome ever new phase and aspect of the Divine Nature, withits endless perfections, in a harmony so perfect that thehappiness of each is the joy of all, and the happiness ofall is the joy of each one ; with capacities ever expandingand deepening to receive more, and to sink down furtherinto the bottomless depths of the Saviour's Heart ; at theSource to drink more fully of the Light which lives there asall-attracting Love, incessantly breaking forth in streamsof blessing, peace, and joy, while he imparts himself to allwho will receive :— or a life in the coldness, darkness, andisolation of an all-devouring Selfhood, which no ray ofheavenly Light can penetrate, or of Love warm ; where theCreature, having entirely and permanently separatedhimself from God, is shut up in the poverty of his owncovetousness, envy, pride, and wrath, raging in fury andmadness, to experience the contradictory workings andself-torturings of mere Desire, unsatisfied and insatiablean Extremity of Want.Wide indeed of the truth has the Protestant worldwandered, wlien it can accept with such eagerness, as asolution of difiiculties, " Natural Law in the SpiritualPseudo-science, having, as it fancies, dethronedWorld."TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.—xvGod from all control of the Physical Universe, and set up iuhis place two fetishes,^ has, it seems, gotten itself baptizedand adopted intotheChristiansystem, and crudegeneralizations of imperfectly observed and half-under-stood physical sequences areacceptedas capable ofexplaining the mysteries of spiritual existence.Morehopeful it would be to try to explain the vital activitiesand living tissues of an oyster from a microscopic examina-tion of the lime particles in its shell.Swedenborg, atrue man of science, one of the most eminent of his time,endeavoured to show how spiritual law underlies andrules the phenomena of the physical world, and a stillprofounder insight into the mystery of the origin of mattermay be found in Law's " Spirit of Love."Illumined andguided by the light of Boehme, he shows how matter andits laws are the outward manifestation, on the physicalplane, of the essential contrarieties of working in spiritualdesire—the torment of spiritual nature, left to itself andworking on and in itself (as was never intended), divorcedfrom God ; to manifest forth whose glories alone, as theirvehicle, it had come into existence with the one qualifica-tion thereto of being in itself an extremity of want.However much there may be in this autobiography tostartle the narrow rationalism of Protestant sects, thoseof her own Communion, who have made themselvesacquainted with the writings of St. John of the Cross, and' The present age was lately characterized, by a speaker at the BritishCould a better illustration ofierAssociation, as " drunken with writing."than the popular acceptance as efficient causes of two mere phrases : the oneNatural Selection—a contradiction in terms ; the other—Survival of theFittest—when stripped of the ambiguity in the word " fittest," a platitudeas rank as Moliere's explanation of opium effects.Doubtless the chief claimon the scientist's adoration lies in the lurking suggestion of Atheism.VOL.

II.]AUTOBIOGRAPHY.—CHAPTER II.I WAS born, according to some accounts, on Easter Even,13fch April—although my baptism was not till 24th Mayin the year 1648, of a father and mother who made pro-fession of very great piety, particularly my father, who hadinherited it from his ancestors ; for one might count, froma very long time, almost as many saints in his family asthere were persons who composed it.I was born, then, notat the full time, for my mother had such a terrible frightthat she brought me into the vrorld in the eighth month,when it is said to be almost impossible to live.I no soonerreceived life than I was on the point of losing it, and dyingThey carried me to a nurse, and I waswithout baptism.no sooner there than they came to tell my father I wasdead.

Assoon as I returned to my father's, my mother left me, asbefore, to the charge of servants, because there was a maidthere in whom she trusted.I cannot help here noting thefault mothers commit who, under pretext of devotion oroccupation, neglect to keep their daughters with them ; forit is not credible that my mother, so virtuous as she was,would have thus left me, if she bad thought there was anybarm in it.I must also condemn those unjust preferencesthat they show for one child over another, which producedivision and the ruin of families, while equality unites thehearts and entertains charity. Why cannot I make fathersand mothers understand, and all persons who wish to guideyouth, the evil they do, when they neglect the guidance ofthe children, when they lose sight of them for a long time^nd do not employ them ?This negligence is the ruin of almost all young girls.12MADAME GUYOX.[Part I.into two extremes ;How many of them are there who would be angels, whomWhat is moreliberty and idleness turn into demons !deplorable is that mothers otherwise devout ruin them-selves by what ought to save them, they make their sin ofwhat ought to constitute then- good conduct, and becausethey have some taste for prayer, especially at the com-mencement, they fallthe one ofwishing to keep young chikU-en in church as long as them-selves, which gives them a strong disgust for devotion, asI have seen in many persons, who when they are free avoidthe church and piety like hell.This arises from theirbeing surfeited with a food they could not relish, becausetheir stomach was not suited for that nourishment, and forwant of power of digestion they conceived such aversion toit that, where it would be suitable for them, they will nolonger even try it. What also contributes to it is thatthese devout mothers keep them so shut up, giving themno liberty, like birds one keeps in a cage, who as soon asthey find any opening fly away and never return ; whereasto tame them when they are young, one should give themfrom time to time a lly, and as their wings are weak andone watches them flying, it is easy to catch them againwhen they escape, and this little flight accustoms them toreturn of themselves into their cage, which is for themI believe we should do thi3become an agreeable iDrisou.same with young girls.

Afurther reason is that tbis amuses tbe soul extremely,binders her from living in total abandonment to tbe DivineProvidence, gives false assurances and frivolous hopes, fillstbe mind with future thing?, and binders from dying to alland passing beyond all things to follow Jesus Christ, naked,despoiled of all.The Eevelation of Jesus Christ, of which St. Paul speaks,72MADAME GUYON.[Part I.It is manifested to the soulis very different from all that.when the eternal Word is communicated to her—revelationwhich makes us become second Jesus Christs on earththrough participation, and which brings to pass that heit is this revelation which isexpresses himself in us ;always true, and which the Devil cannot counterfeit.Ravishments come from another principle. God attractsthe soul powerfully to make her go out of herself and toabsorb her in him ; and of all the gifts I have described, itBut the soul being still arrested byis the most perfect.her self-hood, she can not go out of herself, so that beingattracted on the one hand, and kept back on the other, itis this which operates the ravishment, or flight of thespirit, which is more violent than ecstasy, and sometimesHowever, that which menraises the body from the earth.admire so extraordinarily is an imperfection and a defectin the creature.True ravishment and perfect ecstasy are operated bytotal annihilation, where the soul, losing all self-hood,passes into God without effort and without violence, asinto the place which is proper and natural to her.ForGod is the centre of the soul, and when once the soul isdisengaged from the self-hood which arrested her in herselfor in other creatures, she infallibly passes into God,where she dwells hidden with Jesus Christ.But thisecstasy is operated only by simple faith, death to all thingscreated, even to the gifts of God, which, being creatures,hinder the soul from falling into the One uncreated.It isfor this reason, I say, it is of great importance to make herpass beyond all his gifts, howsoever sublime they mayappear, because, as long as the soul dwells in them, shedoes not veritably renounce herself, and so never passesinto God himself, although she may be in those gifts in avery sublime manner.But resting thus in the gifts, sheloses the real enjoyment of the Giver, which is an in-estimable loss.Cjiap.

Bertot, who was not as useful to me as he wouldhave been if at that time I had had the gift of explainingmyself; but God so conducted me that, whatever desireJ had to conceal nothing, I could not tell him anything.As soon as I spoke to him, everything was taken awayfrom my mind, and I could only remember some defectsI told him. My inner disposition was too simple to beable to tell anything of it, and as I saw him very seldom,in my mind, and I read nothingand nothing dweltsimilar to what I experienced, I knew not how to explainmyself ; besides, I desired to let him know only the evilthat was in me, for which reason M. Bertot has neverknown me until after his death.This has been veryuseful for me, in depriving me of all support, and makingme die to myself.I resolved, after having seen M. Bertot, and finishedmy cure, to go and pass the ten days from Ascension toPentecost in an abbey four leagues from Paris, theAbbess of which had much friendship for me.I thoughtI should there conveniently keep a retreat of ten days.Ihad at that time an extremely strong interior attraction,148MADAME GUYON.[Pakt I.my God, that my union with youand it seemed to rnc,was continual.I experienced that it constantly grewdeeper and withdi-ew from the sensible, becoming moresimple, but at the same time closer and more intimate.On the Day of St. Erasmus, the patron of that con-vent, at four in the morning, I awoke with a start, havinga vivid impression my father was dead.I had no rest tillI had prayed for him as for one dead, and, having done it, Iwas no more troubled ; but there remained with me a strongconviction of his death, together with an extreme prostra-tion and a pleasing grief, which so overwhelmed my bodythat it was reduced to very great weakness.I went to thechurch, where I no sooner was than a faint seized me,and, after I recovered, there remained a loss of voice,and I could not speak.I could not eat the smallest thing—the concentration and the grief were too powerful. Mysoul was in a divine contentment and strength, and myexterior was overwhelmed with grief and weakness.Ishould not have perceived any grief, so great was the con-tentment of my soul, if it had not made this jDOwerfulimpression on my body.In all these blows, and in an infinity of others, I re-marked from the beginning that my will was so supple formy God, that it had not even a repugnanceall your wills,to what you were doing, however hard it might appear tonature ; so that I had no need of resigning myself and sub-I could not even do any act, because the thingmitting.appeared to me all done in me ; there was no longer sub-mission nor resignation, but union of my will to yours,my God, which was such that it seemed to me mine had"disappeared.I knew not where to find that '* my will ;Minebut as soon as I sought a will, I found only yours.did not appear even in its effects, which are the desires,It seemed to me it wouldtendencies, and inclinations.have been impossible to will anything but what you wereIf I had a vdll, it appeared to me that it wasdoing in me.CnAP.

What will appear surprising is that when I com-municated, however penetrated by God I might previouslybe, dryness took the place of abundance, and emptinessthat of plenitude.At present I know very well its cause,Chai'.

We wishto point out a road in place of blindly following that whichhe traces for us ; and this is the cause why many souls,which would be destined to enjoy even God in himself,and not his gifts in them, pass all their life in runningafter little consolations and feasting on them, confiningthat, and even making their happinessthemselves toFor you, my dear children, if my chainsconsist in that.and my captivity touch you, I pray you, they may serveto engage you to seek God only for himself ; never to wishto possess him save by the death of all that 3'ou are, toenjoy him only in loss.Never aim to be anything in theways of the intellect, but yield to the most profoundannihilation.I fell then into the purely natural ; yet my infidelitieswere of a kind that would have appeared a good andvirtue to any other but to my God, who does not judgevirtue by the name people give it, but by the purity andI felt my incli-uprightness of the heart that practises it.nation grow each daj', and that my heart, which previouslywas occupied and filled with its God alone, was full andI used all sorts of penances,occupied only with creatures.It seemed, O my God,prayers, pilgrimages, and vows.I found an increase of my ill in all that I took as aremedy for it, so that I entered upon an inconceivableI can say tears became my drink, and griefdesolation.CiiAr.

As my husbandapproached his end, his ailments were without relaxation.Ho no sooner escaped from one illness than he fell intoanother : gout, fever, gravel, succeeded each other inces-santly. He suffered great pain with considerable patience.He offered it to you, my God, and made a good use of it.The anger ho had against me increased, because theymultiplied reports, and did nothing but embitter him. Howas the more susceptible of these impressions as his ail-Evenments gave him the greater tendency to vexation.that maid who tormented me sometimes took compassionon me, and came to fetch me as soon as I had gone intomy closet, saying, *' Come to monsieur, in order that yourmother-in-law may not speak any more against you."Ipretended to be ignorant of all, but he could not concealfrom me his annoyance, nor even endure me. My mother-in-law at the same time no longer observed any measure,and all those who came to the house were witnesses of thecontinual rudeness to which I was subjected. What is sur-prising is that though 1 had the sentiments of which Ihave spoken, and the pains I have described and shall—174MADA^IE GUYON.[Pakt 1.describe, I nevertheless suffered with mucli patience ; butthis did not appear to me, o^Ying to the frightful revolt Ifelt within against all that was said to me, and as I some-times broke out in hastiness, but seldom, I thought thatthis joined to the inward revolt was a crime.My husband, some time before his death, had built achapel in the country where we spent part of the summer.I had the advantage of hearing Mass every day, and com-municating, but not daring to do it every day openly, thepriest kept a wafer without their noticing it, and as soonas they had gone out, he gave me the Communion.Thededication of this little chapel was celebrated, and thoughI already was beginning to enter upon the state I havejust described, as soon as the blessing was commenced,suddenly I felt myself seized within, and my seizure,which lasted more than five hours, the whole time of theceremony, was that our Lord made a new consecration ofme to himself. This chapel was only the figure of that onewhich our Lord made in me ; but in a manner so powerful,so real, though very inward, that it seems to me I was forhim a temple consecrated for time and for eternitj^I saidto you, *'my God, let this temple never be profaned "speaking of both one and the other— *' and let your praisesIt seems you promised it to me,be sung there for ever."although everything was at once taken away, and there didnot remain even a memory that could console me.AVhen I was at this country house, which was only asmall pleasure house, before the chapel was built, I usedto pray in the woods and in closets. As I greatly loved thecross, I caused crosses to be put up in many places, andthese served me as a hermitage.

There was in it nothing humanor natural, but all pure spirit. And this union, so pure andholy, which has always subsisted and even increased,becoming ever more one, has never arrested or occupiedthe soul for a moment out of God, leaving her always in aperfect freedom ; union which God alone effects, and whichcan take place only between souls who are united to himunion free from all weakness and all attachment ; unionwhich makes one rejoice over, rather than compassionate,the sufferings of the other, and the more w^e see ourselvesoverwhelmed wdth crosses and overthrows, separated,destroyed, the happier one is ; union which for its sub-sistence has no need of bodily presence ; which absenceCuAP.

He told me Ishould take my daughter to Tonon, and that there shewould be very well off. He told me at once, after I hadspoken to him of the internal repugnance I had for themanner of life of the New Catholics, that he did notbelieve God required me to join them, that I should remainthere without an engagement, and that God would letme know by the course of his providence what he desired2S4MADAME GUYON.[Part IT.of me, but that I should remain until God himself byhis providence withdrew me from it, or by the sameprovidence established me there. He determined to staywith us two days, and to say three Masses. He told meto ask our Lord to let me know his will.I could neitherask anj-thing nor desire to know anything.I continued inmy simple disposition.I had already commenced wakingup so as to pray at midnight, but on this occasion I wasroused up as if a person had awaked me ; and on wakingthese words were suddenly put into m}'' mind with somelittle impetuosity : " It is written of me that I will performyour w^ill," and this insinuated itself into my soul with aflow of grace, so pure, yet so penetrating, that I have neverexperienced it more sweet, more simple, stronger, or moreI should remark here that although the then statepure.of my soul was permanent in newness of life, that new lifewas not yet in the fixedness it has since been in ; that isto say, properly, that it was an opening life and an openingday, which goes on increasing and strengthening itselfto the meridian of glory— day, however, where there is nolife which fears no longer death in death itself,night ;because death has conquered death, and he who hassuffered the first death will never taste the second death.Now, it is well to say here that though the soul boin a state void of movement, and that she participatesof the unchangeable, without the soul leaving her sphereor her heaven, steadfast and motionless, where there isneither distinction nor change, God, however, when itpleases him, sends from this very central depth certaininfluences which have distinctions, and which make knownhis holy will, or things about to happen; but as thiscomes from the central depth, and not by the interventionof the powers, it is certain, and not subject to illusion,as are visions and the other matters of which I haveFor it should be known that such aalready spoken.soul as that I speak of receives all immediately fromChap.
