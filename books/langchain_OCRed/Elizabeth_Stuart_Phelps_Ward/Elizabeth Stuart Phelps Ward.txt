Whenthere was nothing left for me to learn upon thesubject, I came home and wrote a little story" The Tenth of January," and sent it tocalled"The Atlantic Monthly," where it appeared indue time.This story is of more interest to its authorthan it can possibly be now to any reader, because it distinctly marked for me the firstrecognition which I received from literary peo-pie.Whittier the poet wrote me his first letter,It was soon fol-after having read this story.92JOHN GREENLEAF WHITT1ERTHE FALL OF THE PEMBERTON MILLBoth theselowed by a kind note from Colonel ThomasWentworth Higginson.distinguished men said the pleasant thing which goesso far towards keeping the courage of youngwriters above sinking point, and which, to aself-distrustful nature, may be little less than alife-preserver.

My impressions arethat it may have been towards the close of1864 that the work began ; for there was workin it, more than its imperfect and youthfulcharacter might lead one ignorant of the art ofbook-making to suppose.It was not until 1863 that I left school, beingthen just about at my nineteenth birthday.Itis probable that the magazine stories and Sunday-school books and hack work occupied fromone to two years without interruption ; but Ihave no more temperament for dates in my ownaffairs than I have for those of history.

The process offorming and writing "The Gates Ajar" lasted,I think, nearly two years.I had no study or place to myself in thosedays ; only the little room whose one windowlooked upon the garden cross, and which it wasnot expected would be warmed in winter.The room contained no chimney, and, until Iwas sixteen, no fire for any purpose. At thattime, it being supposed that some delicacy ofthe lungs had threatened serious results, myfather, who always moved the sods beneathhim and the skies above him to care for a sickchild, had managed to insert a little stove intothe room, to soften its chill when needed.ButI did not have consumption, only life ; and onewas not expected to burn wood all day for private convenience in our furnace-heated house.100THE GATES AJARWas there not the great dining-room where thechildren studied ?It was not so long since I, too, had learnedmy lessons off the dining-room table, or in thecorner by the register, that it should occur toany member of the family that these opportunities for privacy could not answer my needs.Equally, it did not occur to me to ask for anyI therefore made the bestabnormal luxuries.of my conditions, though I do remember sorelylonging for quiet.This, at that time, in that house, it was impossible for me to compass.There was a growfour of them,^ofing family of noisy boys,whom I was the only sister, as I was the oldest child.

They were merry, healthy boys,and everything was done to keep them so.Isometimes doubt if there are any happier children growing anywhere than the boys and girlsof Andover used to be.I was very fond ofthe boys, and cherished no objection to their101CHAPTERS FROM A LIFEBut when one wentprivileges in the house.down, on a cold day, to the register, to writeone's chapter on the nature of amusements inthe life to come, and found the dining-roomneatly laid out in the form of a church congregation, to which a certain proportion of brotherswere enthusiastically performing the duties ofan active pastor and parish, the environmentwas a definite check to inspiration.I wonder if all Andover boys played at preachIt certainly was the one sport in ouring ?house which never satiated.Coming in one day, I remember, strugglingwith certain hopeless purposes of my own, foran afternoon's work, I found the dining-roomchairs all nicely set in the order of pews ; atable, ornamented with Bible and hymn-books,confronted them ; behind it, on a cricket, towered the bigger brother, loudly holding forth.The little brother represented the audienceit was usually the little one who was forced toand, with open mouth,play this duller r61eand with wriggling feet turned in on the roundsof the chair, absorbed as much exhortation ashe could suffer."is,"My text, brethren," said the little minister,' Suffer the little children to come untome.'"

As ahouse, it is very difficult ; but Mrs. Stowe hasalways had the home-touch in a beautiful degree.In fact, my chief impression of those yearswhen we had the rich opportunity of her vicinityconsists in occasional glimpses of lovely interiors, over which presided a sweet and quiet presence, as unlike the eidolon which Andover Seminary seemed to have created for itself of thisgreat and gracious lady, as a spirit is unlike anold-time agitator. To tell the truth,whichperhaps is not necessaryI dimly suspectedthen, and I have been sure of it since, that theprivilege of neighborhood was but scantily appreciated in Andover in the case of this eminent woman. Why, I do not know. She gaveno offense, that I can recall, to the peculiarpreferences of the place ; the fact that she was132MRS.

A traditionthat she visited the theatre in Boston when shefelt like it, sometimes passed solemnly from lipto lip ; but this is the most serious criticismupon her which I can remember.I have since found suspicion blossoming intoa belief that the vagueness of arithmetic whichled to an insufficient estimate of Mrs. Stowe'svalue, or at least to a certain bluntness in oursense of the honor which she did to Andoverby living among us, sprung from the fact thatshe was a woman.Andover was a heavily masculine place. Shewas used to eminent men, and to men whothought they were, or meant to be, or werethought to be by the ladies of their families,and the pillars of their denomination. At thesubject of eminent women the Hill had notI have sometimes wondered whatarrived.would have been the fate even of my mother,had she lived to work her power to its bloom.And Mrs. Stowe's fame was clearly a fact soapart from the traditions and from the ideals,The best ofthat Andover was puzzled by it.CHAPTERS FROM A LIFEher good men were too feudal in their viewsof women in those days, to understand a lifelike Mrs. Stowe's.It should be rememberedthat we have moved on since then, so fast andso far, that it is almost as hard now for us tounderstand the perplexity with which intelligent, even instructed men, used to consider thephenomenon of a superior woman, as it wasthen for such men to understand such a womanLet us offer to them the width of symat all.pathy and fineness of perception which theydid not always know how to offer to the woman.My personal remembrances of Mrs. Stoweare those of a young girl whom she entertainedat intervals, always delightfully, in the longparlor running the width of the stone house,whose deep embrasured window-seats seemedto me only less wonderful than the soft andbrightly-colored, rather worldly-looking pillowswith which these attractive nooks were genThere were flowers always, anderously filled.a bower of ivy made summer of the eternalAndover winters in the stone house ; and thereMrs. Stowe waswere merry girls and boys,the most unselfish and loving of mothers,andthere were always dogs ; big and little, curlyand straight ; but in some form, dog-life withits gracious reaction on the gentleness andkindness of family life abounded in her house.MRS.

Her dignity, her repose, a certain dreaminess and aloofness of manner characteristic ofher, blended gently with her look of peace andunmistakable happiness. Crowded with honorsas her life had been, I have fancied that this,among her latest, in her quiet years, and so fullof the tenderness of personal friendship, hadespecial meanings to her, and gave her deeppleasure.

He talked less of theology, and moreof Christianity ; less of error, and more oftruth ; less of other men's failures to representthe divine life and purpose as it should be, andmore of the great longings and struggle of thehuman heart, or of his own, to reach the " Everlasting Love," around whose throne are cloudsand darkness.More than once I have heard him speak of" Eternal Hope," withCanon Farrar's book,an emotion touching to witness, and ennoblingHis face broke, and the tearsto remember."

My recollections of him, suchas they are, I find to be either definitely ofa grave and religious nature, or sparklingwith social gayetyone of the two extremes.I do not recall him at all in what I onceheard called " a comfortable, middling view ofthings/'In conversation he was one of the merriestSometimes I used to thinkof entertainers.him almost too ready to let the occasion floataway in jest, while I, like so many others,would have chosen to sound with him sometheme of height or depth ; but of course onecan readily understand how weary his nervemight have become of the seriousness of life,and how much it needed " the light touch."For this reason, perhaps, the occasions inwhich the man revealed himself with powerand solemnity are more distinct in my mind.Once, I had asked a favor of him : that hewould receive a little friend of mine, a sweetlassie, who had listened to his preaching tillher heart had chosen him for her priest.Shewas scarcely more than a child, but not at alla common one ; her need was genuine, andnot to be confounded with a girl's mere hero-In his ownworship for a popular preacher.1 86PHILLIPS BROOKShearty way he welcomed her to his house,whither it was expected that I would accomI did so ; occupying myself, I repany her.member, with a pile of fresh galleys in anotherroom, while the child went into the preacher'sstudy."We will stay," I said, "but ten minutes.Send her out to me when the time is up."a half hourFifteen minutes passedmyproof-sheets were all corrected before the clergyman came out with the child.

Themoral struggle, the creation of character, themoral ideal, failure and success in reaching it,anguish and ecstasy in missing or gaining it,the instinct to extend the appreciation of moralbeauty, and to worship its Eternal Source,these exist wherever human being does. Thewhole magnificent play of the moral naturesweeps over the human stage with a force, asplendor, and a diversity of effect, which noartist can deny if he would, which the greatest artist never tries to withstand, and againstwhich the smallest will protest in vain.Strike " Ethicism"out of life, good friends,before you shake it put of story !"Fear less to seem " Puritanthan to be inFear more to be superficial than to"point your moraladequate.seem "than to miss your opportunity.deep."
