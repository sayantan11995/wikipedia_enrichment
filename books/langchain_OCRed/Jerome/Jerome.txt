The original was published in 1595,and formed a work of some 580 pages of about 400 words.The new edition, of which the present issue is a translation, was brought out with two short discourses by FrayJuan Gonzalez on the learned author, an epitome of whichI proceed to give in English, in order to afford the readersome idea of the Spanish writer of the renowned Life ofSaint Jerome.“At the middle of the sixteenth century, at the periodwhen in Spain Belles-Lettres were as advanced as theprofession of arms, and when both the study of letters andthe profession of arms were as much attended to as religionitself, there was born in the city of Sigüenza the venerableand renowned historian who contributed to the JeromiteOrder so much glory, and to letters so great an advancement.writermanifested a great love of study, and the progress he madein the years of his childhood and youth, was so markedxiearliest years thisFrom hisclassicalxiiTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthat all who knew him felt convinced that he would someday prove to be no ordinary man, since he was becomingso distinguished at the very commencement of life. Thereligious orders, with their glorious traditions, scientificand literary, afforded a beneficent asylum to science, as wellas to virtue, and in the solitude of their cloisters, saintsand sages grew up together and flourished.In those daysthe religious of St. Jerome were much esteemed, andprotected by the Spanish monarchs, and it was into thisOrder that our student of Sigüenza sought to enter andobtained admission, where he soon surpassed his companions in learning and talent... ...After repeated entreaties, he received the holy habit inthe celebrated monastery del Parral de Segovia, in whichthe uncle of our novice was one of the community. To beable to state how the monks watched his progress in thestrict observance of the rule, and his growth in virtue,would be a sufficient matter for a whole treatise. Theholy monks, who considered that Father Joseph of Sigüenzawas destined for great things, sent him to the RoyalCollege of San Lorenzo to complete his studies, where,later on, he became one of the first religious when, in 1575,the monks were translated from Parral to the sumptuousmonastery that Philip II. bequeathed to future generations.Here, first as a disciple, and subsequently as master, heacquired great renown for his piety and assiduity in study,so much so, that he acquired a great influence among hiscompanions, and an authority which was acknowledgedeven by that great king, who ever listened to him withdeepest respect.And as it is written, “he who humbleth himself shallbe exalted,” the more Father Sigüenza sought to concealhimself in this retreat, with no other solace but his books,all the more did the monasteries of his Order exert all theirPREFACE TO THE TRANSLATIONxiiipowers to induce him to accept the prelacy, of which heBut it could not be allowed thathad a great dread.ItFather Sigüenza should remain in humble obscurity.had seemed to the wise monk, that, by entering the royalmonastery of San Lorenzo, where, by the founder's intention, the monks were not to leave that house for anotherof their Order, he would be left in undisturbed peace, sohe resolved to profess a second time, and thus be free fromany acceptance of higher charges.At that time theredwelt in San Lorenzo the illustrious Arias Montana, andour virtuous monk became his disciple. So rapidly, underthis wise master, did Father Sigüenza advance in theknowledge of the Hebrew and Greek languages, and, inthe science of the sacred Scriptures, that one of the gloriesof this master, was the honour of having left such a discipleas his successor.The historical and learned subjects executed on thedomes and walls of the magnificent library of San Lorenzoby the excellent Italian artist Peregin de Peregrini, werechosen by Sigüenza, who had succeeded the erudite AriasMontana in the office of chief librarian.Philip II. was wont to say: “Those who come to seethis wonder of the world, do not see the principal wonder itcontains if they do not see Father José de Sigüenza, for, inziew of his merits, I say that his fame will last longerthan the building, despite that it has every mark and characteristic of solidity and durability.” On another occasion,when the ministers who surrounded the king were discussing the learning of Sigüenza, qualifying him virtuous,saintly, and learned, Philip II. turned to them and said,“Why fatigue yourselves recounting what he is and whathe knows? Better state what José de Sigüenza does NotÁnow, and you will end the discussion sooner.”Inflexible towards himself, charitable and indulgentxivTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEto others, most tenderly loving towards God, in studyuntiring, ever foremost in the religious observance ofhumility and all other Christian virtues, a true model ofthe religious life, Father José de Sigüenza was justlyrenowned in life, and died the death of a saintly man onthe 22nd of May 1606.His memory is deeply respectedin the holy Order wherein he professed, and of his virtuesthe loftiest idea is preserved.”\“The chief works he bequeathed to us by his profoundlearning were the history, or life, which is the subject of thisbook, and two parts of the history of his Order.”“Father José of Sigüenza is rightly considered to beone of the first Castilian classical writers, and under hisbrilliant pen the rich, harmonious language of Castile haslent itself grandly to develop the ideas of the illustrioussage."This history, or life of St. Jerome, is a masterpiece inmore senses than one; and in our epoch, when every onewrites, and the greater number do so in a flippantmanner, it appears to me, that the Jeromite Fathers haverendered a signal service to science and letters, to reprinthis grand work at their expense; a work which has longbeen sought after by all erudite men who love the literatureof Spain.It is this work which I have translated, that myhumble efforts may make it known to the English-speakingraces, who appreciate all that is grand and noble, and trueof all nations, and even give them an honoured place intheir libraries.MARIANA MONTEIRO.ST.

Toremedy this evil, God provided a Moses, who, afterthat was needed ofobtaining from their science allinformation, openly manifested to them upon what vainfoundations they had erected all their beliefs; and that,which, through His divineexceptingmercy, were communicated in the supernatural order tomen, all else was illusion and phantasy, or what wasonly of the earth, earthly.thingsthoseWhen the people of Israel were in such a state oftransgression and wickedness that, forgetful of the holyLaw which they had received of God through the handsof His holy angels, they fell into a miserable idolatry,God raised up a Samuel who corrected them, and keptAUTHOR'S PREFACExviithem faithful to the ancient and good customs of theirforefathers; quelled the disorder which reigned amongstthe people, and established order and government underthe rule of one supreme head, their king.Some, alas,indeed many of their kings, in order to follow theirpleasures and interests, contemned the holy laws andceremonies which had been given them from heaven,and fell, dragging with them the greater number of thepeople who were inclined to follow the example of theirprince into the former idolatry, and with it into everyspecies of vice imaginable.To rectify so great anabuse, it was needed that God should provide for them,as He usually does, a remedy, and this in the person ofan Elias, whose strength of virtue should be commensurate with the wickedness of the king and people!And Elias was a man who in his life, words, work, andzeal, was such a contrast to all that was the usage inIsrael, that it was clearly manifest that he had beenraised by God Himself, in order to be the generalremedy for so many evils.holytheministers,The chosen people were no less in an extreme stateof misery when the intruder Herod reigned, nor werethe vices of avarice, ambition, hypocrisy, usury, simony,and homicide less predominant when God raised a newTo raise is called in theand no less zealous Elias.provision which God makes ofholy Scripturesthese(comparativelybothspeaking) all other men are, as it were, fallen, andoverthrown in their sins, as because these chosen menof God rise up, and are standing erect, courageous, andready to obey whatever God should command them.The man whom God raised up at this era was JohntheBaptist, by whom He not only remediedthetide of so many evils and false doctrines, but furtherbecausebxviiiTHE LIFE OF ST.

JEROMEwereIt is the life of this great man that I purpose towrite inthe Castilian language in a more lengthymanner than has ever been written before, either inSpanish or in Latin—a task of great difficulty, by reasonof its historic value, and on account of the subjectmatter, varied and grave, an honourable undertaking,Few have hitherto grasped theyet difficult of issue.history of it;saints' lives many indeed have undertaken to write; whether these have carried forwardtheir intent successfully, it is difficult to judge, unlessby admitting new laws unknown to the ancients.Inregard to the Castilian language, if it is used simply itis condemned; if written with care it appears affected—atongue little used, cultivated by the few; whilst thosewho think they know it, also think that in order tospeak it well, it should be made up of new vocabularieswhichThesubject-matter, grave and lofty, teems with singularcontrarieties, which we find difficult to compare withfaithother saints.most constant in times of deadly depression and indecision, an extreme obedience to Pope and Church, athing, indeed, for all times, but in these, of greatestimportance.Various peregrinations, temptations of thedevils, miraculous punishments, and trials made by Godin His saint; a great renunciation of country, of parents,brethren, friends, and allies, with an utter forgetfulnessand denial in its highest degree of the things of life, liketo a new sampler of Abraham.Further on we findhim, the master of a great variety of tongues, endowedwith the knowledge of rare languages; not only Greekand Hebrew, but even Chaldaic, Arabic, Syrian, andother dialects—a thing in those days, and also in ours,inpossessed by thefew, despised by some, heldpoint we find a vividforefathers.known toAt oneournotAUTHOR'S PREFACExxiInterpretationssuspicion by others; so greatly can ignorance work,even when levelled against persons held in authority bythe world, which dares to blaspheme what it is ignorantofof Holy Writ, various versions,questions oftentimes disputed and not duly investigatedon account of their difficulty and of the many opinions,in which the many either speak obscurely oraffairsthrough the mouths of others who are but little betterinformed than themselves.Descriptions of countries,more particularly of the Holy Land, difficult to portrayowing to the distance, and by reason of the changeseffected by the times, the peoples, places, and names.theestablishmentand the order ofYet, that not all be good (although all is good tothe good), we shall witness evil, mean behaviours, andgreat ingratitude againstsaint, false testimonies,themalice, lies, wrongs done him by friends and enemies—all this to need almost the description of a Moses andhis life to portray our saint, a thing as it were impossible were it not that the veil has been alreadytheremoved;services of the Church and divine worship; the singingof the Psalms, as well as other embellishments andgreater lustre of the holy ceremonies; his assistance inthe business of the Pope, and replies to the causesof faith, and determinations of the Councils—affairs allof them of great difficulty and obscurity, wherein isbarely found the way to trace the lines of demarcation.Furthermore, to trace out and show the sincerity andtruth with which so many things were handled by onesaint exman only; the smallperienced from men; the ingratitude of those whoprofited by his labours, all this manifests from head tofoot a Samuel who himself went through all this atthe hands of the city and people, not more ungratefulinterest which thexxiiTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEtowards him than ungrateful Rome behaved towardsJerome.Likewise must be stated and shown a free heartfull of evangelical fortitude, established on the securityof his own conscience, who looked not to the lineageof persons, theirstate, their office, their vices; whoprescribed rules, who administered reprehensions, whogave counsels to such a variety of persons, priests andmonks, bishops and knights, maidens, widows, religiouswomen andfathers andmothers, masters and servants; who greatly loved thelittle ones if they were saintly; who humbled the prideof the great ones of the earth if they were evil; andwho ever desired to exercise the humblest offices;large-hearted to reject what the world so unreasoninglycalls greatness—all this is no less than to manifest thelives of an Elias and St. John newly returned to theworld !married persons,children,And yet more than this, we shall see, as it behovesto state, the rigors of so much penance, the wearing ofa hairshirt, the enduring of chains, nakedness, hunger,strikings of the breast, long and weary illnesses, fastingsalmost unprecedented, journeyings into deserts, the companionship of wild beasts, the terrible temptations of thedevils, and the still greater persecutions by heretics,prolonged prayers, revelations, raptures, ecstasies, andextraordinary excesses of the soul, discomforts of thebody, weariness of spirit, untold labours, profound studies,abstruse writings by new and unexplored yet true pathsall this presupposes almost an impossible existence, andas it were little less than a miracle to succeed in somany details.Yet it is, however, a great assistance, andof much encouragement to us, that (independently of thereason and foundation of obedience, which can do muchit dares) our saint on several well-nigh—indeed, allAUTHOR'S PREFACExxiiiThis appliesimperative occasions wrote down many of his acts, andthat in his descriptions he was as scrupulous in theirstatements as he had been in fulfilling them. We mightwell say of him that which was said of Caesar when writingthe commentary of his deeds, that he had done so only toleave matter for writers; yet he took the matter off theirhands, because no one could recount the deeds better thanhimself.to Jerome more appropriately,because, although as regards purity of language fewequalled Caesar, yet as to the fidelity of his statements hebears no comparison with Jerome.Hence the principalpart of this history will be his own descriptions, renderedwith fidelity, in accordance with the best admitted rulesof translation, assisted also by reliable authors, takingsmall heed of others, that, at the price of being consideredastute, gave way to malice and impiety, desirous of takingaway on many occasions a large portion of the glory fromthat great Father whom the Holy Church with loud publicvoice willed to style great amid the doctors; because ifRome had her Fabiis and Valeriis, Greece her Alexander,France her Charles, on whom was bestowed the surnameof ‘Great' by reason of achievements by pen or sword,with far greater motive and reason does the Churchbestow the appellation on her Jerome for his thousandvictories gained over heretics, and as many more won bythe grandeur of his pen.The order of procedure followed in writing this Lifewill be the same as the saint followed; for since Godbestowed on him such length of days that he passedthrough all the ages and periods which divide the lifeof man, we shall divide the history into the Seven Agesof Man, because God willed that his long life should giveus to understand the great importance his life would be tothe world. The narrative will be in six books, the betterxxiv.THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEto distinguish the various stages, because the smallpatience of readers of the present day does not admitof that continuity which the ancients so loved.Should the judgment of such as know what writinghistory is, be offended at the many digressions, I thinkthey will also perceive, that they are not made without apurpose, and that it is the life of a saint wherein of thethree component parts which the historian is bound tofollow, the principal one must needs be erudition andTheeconomy, and the inculcation of good customs.two first ages will form the first book, since the subjectmatter is so short; and each book will be divided intodiscourses, as the title of the work leaves me exoneratedfrom following the precise laws of history.CONTENTSBOOK THE FIRSTFIRST AND SECOND AGES-INFANCY AND PUBERTYPROEMPage3DISCOURSE THE FIRSTON THE BIRTHPLACE, PARENTAGE, AND NAME of ST.

The fifth is called manhood, andthen he is in full possession of his manliness; and it maybe said of this period that nature, so far as the body isconcerned, is stationary in her work, having attained thezenith of human life; and this condition lasts until hisforty-ninth year. Then speedily follows senescence, that34THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEtime of life in which the bloom of youth commences todecline, and manly beauty to fade, whose limits are soFromshort that it only extends to the fifty-sixth year.that time forward, according to the common opinion, theterm is old age, or decrepitude, without assigning anyfurther limit or period, as St. Augustine says, who, comparing the ages of man with those of the world, affirms thatsenescence lasts as long as all the other six periods together,because, commencing at latest from the sixtieth year, itmay be prolonged even to the hundredth or hundred-andtwentieth year.Hence the life of man continues to rise and declinethroughout these grades of septenaries, from which it tookthe name of climacteric; and it is a fact, as Seneca andothers affirm, that in each of these periods of seven years,the human frame undergoes a change. From this it followsthat the diseases which attend on the limits of these epochsare always the most dangerous. The Gentiles had greatdread of this occurrence, and with good reason, since theyhad no hope, and death was always a source of fear to them,and therefore they always congratulated one another whenthese crises were past.It may here be opportune to draw attention to theremarkable correspondence which exists between theexternal world and the world of the human kingdom,which is man, and also to see how both are maintainedand flourish.God, the Author and Father of all things,during a term of seven days, produced this grand creationwhich we behold, and supported it from one to sevendays with the powers and influences which descended fromon high.And into seven ages is its duration divided.From this is understood what is declared in the Book ofCreation,” that God perfected on the seventh day all whatLib. 83, pp. 58, t. 41.Genesis ii.PROEM5soever works He had determined to effect; which meansto say that, until the seventh day no created things wereperfect, nor had they attained to their fulness; becausethey were, so to say, on the road towards perfection, and,had they not reached it, they would have been, so toThe Hebrew word, which is therespeak, abortive.employed, meaning “fulfilled” and “finished,” is of greatdepth of meaning, because it not only signifies what weare in process of explaining, viz. that it was perfect andwithout flaw in its work, but likewise it signifies the reins,wherein are held the strength and desire of procreation. Sothat it may be said and understood that all this beautifulmechanism of the world is like a divine childbirth, anda creature of God, drawn from the virtue of His omnipotence—from nothingness to the being that it has.Henceall creatures assume to be similar to the principle whencethey were drawn; these, in their turn, also producing somebeing possessing these same limitations which their Makerplaced in them of seven ages, whether of days or years.From this is likewise comprehended why God did notwish the name to be given to the child until after theseventh day, as though the being was still a thing whichAnd Aristotle observes, in his book of thewas not.History of Animals that many died before attaining theeighth day.This is the divine secret that is contained innumbers; and I know not whether the philosophers themselves, who so largely discoursed upon numbers, comprehended the mystery.Aristotle derides Empedocles and Plato, his master,because they laid such stress on this matter; but hisambitious words were not sufficient to derogate fromeither the glory or renown which they acquired from theirclose study of the divine letters, and by communicatingLib. 7, et ult.6THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwith such sages as had a still greater knowledge of them,from which sources they derived many of the wise thoughtswhich they have given to the world.But of this I willspeak no more at present, because the infancy and thepuberty of our saint need our further consideration.It was a custom in ancient times for the sons of thenoblest in the land, when still youths, to serve at thebanquets of the great and at the solemnities of thesacrifices, to offer the cup and to dispense the wine to theinvited guests. And Athenaeus' thus refers to what theson of King Menelaus did : “And to this day this serviceis performed at table in France by those called pages, as islikewise done in Castile, thus, in a certain manner preserving the name and office of the ancient nobility. Thesewere youths of tender age, and were selected, as far as itwas possible, of equal height, and similar in age, countenThe ancients never did anything in aance, and style.meaningless way and at haphazard.They invested allthings with a certain mystery; and in this service ofmaking boys serve as pages of the cup in their sacrifices,they taught us much.Because, without doubt, the soulsof the little ones and of youths of tender age are in truthlike to empty chalices, since they no less thirst to drink theliquor of good doctrine than old men to desire wine. Andif the old men are cheered and recreated by the juice ofthe generous vine, much more are the tender spirits ofthose fair youths delighted with the sweetness of science;and by pouring out the wine to drink in the sacrifice, itwould seem as though they demanded, in return, that theold men should enlighten them in the sacraments and inthe mysteries and secrets that are enclosed in the sacrifices.”It will be very opportune here to describe that singularfigure by which the Egyptians depicted their god Canopus.1 Lib. Io, c. 7.PROEM7The whole figure was in the form of a cup, such as we callimperial. The face and head were those of a boy; theears were large and uncovered; the body draped orenveloped closely by a net, similarly as we moderns covercups or chalices of gold, or china bowls to save them frombeing broken or injured. The figure was finished by thefeet being placed close together, forming the stem andpedestal to the whole.In its hands it held a staff, the topof which finished with the head of a lark; lower down thestaff was pierced through by a stick, which thus formeda cross, and in its hands grasped the letter A. By thissymbol they wished to signify the whole discourse, condition, and state of a child, and the fair hope promised ofits future if the child was brought up as it should be.Forthis reason the figure bore the head of a boy, becauseyouth is a fragile, critical period, and, unless great care istaken of a child, it runs a great danger, as our saint willtell us farther on, when he speaks of himself.This factis also implied by the net with which Canopus is girt, whichis no other than education, fear, and the proper respectwith which a child should be bound and safeguarded.Moreover, great care should be taken to instil into thechild some good liquor of instruction, for which its puresoul is athirst, and for right good reasons did the ancientsgive their god large open ears, which are like a mouth,And,through which these delicate cups are to be filled.whereas these ears are wide awake to receive good doctrine,all the other members and senses must needs be well girtand covered up, in order that these powers be not unboundso as to do anything exceeding good morals and againstmodesty, in accordance with what the apostle St. Jamesteaches when he says, we should be “swift to hear andslow to speak.” What liquor is to be poured into thosereceptacles is declared by the symbol it holds in its hands:8THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe staff crowned by the head of a lark, signifying thecourse of life which is all to be employed in the divinepraises, rising up from the earth even as the lark soarsheavenwards, pouring its melodious strains.The wholeof this life must be fitted and sustained upon the Thau,which is the cross-hilt of this staff. And the first object,which should be placed in the hands of the child andimpressed on its heart, is the knowledge of the Christianreligion, which is wholly founded on the Cross, and thenbe guided to learn contempt of the world, to bear suffering,and to be patient in all adversities, and to imitate Christ.Along these paths is progress made, and by no others,For thistowards eternal life signified by the letter A.letter, bearing the form of a pyramid, ends in a point, andis the symbol of simplicity and the most perfect union, andbeing wide open at the base, without limits, it manifeststhat it embraces and encloses within itself all things,—theproper signs of eternity.Hence this spiritual receptacleof the youth, being filled by the fragrant liquor of doctrineat the commencement of life, will retain, as said the poet,a good odour, and persevering in purity and innocence oflife, that soul will attain to be, not only the chalice, butthe very temple of the Holy Ghost.All this and much more, did the ancients tell usallegorically by the figure of their god Canopus, and it waswith good reason that St. Peter in his Epistle (2 Peter ii.)calls “learned ”the fables of the ancients. And, in passing,it may be said here that neither Suidas, nor Rufinus, norothers, who judged that in all these ideas there wasnaught else but ridiculous rivalries between the god of theChaldeans, which was fire, and the god of the Egyptians,which was Canopus, understood the figures signified. Forto people who were so learned and enlightened as werethe Egyptians and the Chaldeans, who held so close anPROEM9intercourse with the holy patriarchs, in whom were foundthe good seed of sound doctrine, no such childish ideascould be ascribed.This also will be made manifest to usby experience when treating of the infancy and pubertyof our saint, of whom, since his parents had brought himup with such care, and he himself from his tenderest yearshad practised the holiest exercises of religion, good instruction and pure morals, great hopes were entertained of agrand future, as antiquity signified to us by the statueof the god Canopus.Farther on we shall see also that he became a handsome youth, and how in the pedigree of the Church, aswell as at the grand open banquet celebrated in her, he,who was so brimful of her holy sacraments, will serve thecup and liquor of the most precious wine to all the guests,during the first and second periods of his age.It therefore behoves all of us to consider with greatattention these things. To some of us, because having lostthat innocence with which we were invested in the newregeneration when having been born anew, we obtainedthe right to the heirship of the kingdom of Heaven, wemay be able to return once again to enjoy our forfeitedinheritance by means of penance, imitating the exampleof so great a Father, recovering lost purity and holiness.To others again, who are beginning anew the path of perfection, in order that they may see where to place their feet,and that the narrow path be not obliterated by the dustaroused by the crowds of worldlings, with which dust oureyes become blinded, and we find ourselves unable todiscover the inheritance so greatly desired by all, andinstead of finding Jerusalem, the blessed city of peace,union, conformity, and light, we should instead stumbleinto Babylon, full of confusion and disorder, without peace,without harmony, and without light.DISCOURSE THE FIRSTOn the Birthplace, Parentage, and Name of Saint Jerome.ALL holy writers teach that when writing the lives ofsaints, who perfectly despised the world, we should notlay any stress on the things which they held in disesteem;nor proceed in accordance with the laws of the world,taking account of nobility of parentage and investigatingBecause those, who withinthe antiquity of the house.themselves have every cause of glory and praise, havesmall need to demand any from the outside world.Also, because he, who considers the state of a Christian,fact that wewill perceive, that independently of theproceed from one ancient stock, where all nobilities arealike, and one common hearth, whence we all spring;we have one only Father, who is Christ, from whomwith so much equality we proceed on our journey towardsan equal inheritance, out of which, through our own fault,And, if the first and commonwe have been exiled.father as regards the natural being is One, and One alsothe Father in the supernatural order, the line of procedurewithout variation and the goal to which we journey thesame, it follows that all the other divisions which weperceive are only inventions of the world, which theheavens deride and the saints scorn, and which willperish as quickly as the foundations, on which they areIoBIRTHPLACE1 Ibased, are weak and faulty.Although this be of itselftrue, and of small value for the glory of the saints, and itbe of little moment to mention such-like points, yet it isnevertheless imperative in histories relating to saints totake some notice of these things for our profit andspiritual advantage; forasmuch as in the realms above,where the blessed enjoy God, they have a manner ofinclination (if we may be allowed so to express it) ofprotecting their own lands, in order to succour them intheir needs, and make cause in the Divine audience ontheir behalf, when they are just ones, and when not justto withdraw them.Also, because the natives of suchlands themselves study with greater attention the lives ofthose who were born within the walls of their native place,and who now are so high in glory, and are therebyencouraged to follow their well-marked footsteps withoutfeeling that the path of Christian perfection is impossible,their own neighbours havesince they perceive thatjourneyed along it.For all these considerations, when seeking to investigate the birthplace of our saint, it will not be undueto this Christian history, nor be ascribed to vanity, if somelabour be undertaken to find it, nor to argue for it, ashappened in the cities of Greece, where, at the price ofmany lives and much contention, the cities each put forththeir respective claim in favour of being the birthplace ofMelesigenes, who, on account of being blind, was calledHomer;' and so rife did the dispute become that someeven called him their god, erecting a temple to him, as weare assured by trustworthy authors was the case in thecity of Smyrna.Somewhat similar, but in a more just cause, occurs inrespect to the country of our saint and doctor, because1 Cicero in Orat. pro Archia.Herodotus, Plutar., Gellius, Lib. iii.I 2THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEatthatone timehissituated onplace wasalbeit he says distinctlyStridon,ofDalmatia and Pannonia, and which was later on assailedby the barbarian Goths, nevertheless, in the examination of this point, there arise great difficulties and manydifferences of opinion.nativetheconfinesThe reason of this was the desolation caused by Alaricand Radagisus, captains of the Goths, before passing on toItaly, and which was so great that the saintly doctorsays in the Commentaries on Habacuc, “that they leftalive no man whether great or small, nor even suchanimals as are necessary for the service of man.” And inthe Commentary on Sophonias, he says: “The animalsalso felt the wrath of the Lord, because when the citieswere destroyed and the inhabitants perished, the fieldsremained devastated of animals, and the air of birds. Awitness of this is Illyria, as also Thrace, and the land,where I was born, in which, but for the earth itself, andthe brambles, air, and the buckthorn, there has remainednought, for all has perished.”These territories having thus been laid waste, as oursaint tells us, doubts then arose and opinions became rifeas to his actual birthplace. The Italians, desirous ofclaiming for themselves such a great man, adduced athousand reasons; the natives of Dalmatia and Sclavonia,gave as many more, yet all these put forward such goodfoundations for their claims, that it became a very difficulttask to give a verdict in favour of any one of them. TheItalians say” and with truth, that Istria is one of theregions of Italy, and was originally inhabited by some ofthe soldiers which Actaeus,the King of the Island of Colchos,These founded thehad sent in pursuit of the Argonauts.In Carthage.Blondo, De Italia Illustrata.Regione xi.BIRTHPLACE13InIstriacity of Aquileia, and established themselves there. Theprovince of Istria terminates on the south with the IllyrianSea, which is now called the Adriatic, and the Gulfof Venice. On the east lies Dalmatia, on the northPannonia.is found a small town calledEsdrigna, the same as in former times was called Stridon,the native land of our glorious saint. They also declarethat in this same town there exists a sepulchre, which byancient tradition is said to be that of Eusebius, the fatherof St. Jerome, as was stated in an inscription found onthe stone of the sepulchre, engraved on a slab of lead.This statement is confirmed by the intimate friendshipwhich existed between Jerome and Chromatius, provedby the many letters that passed between them, as well aswith Rufinus, since both were of Aquileia, and it is morethan probable that, whereas they came from neighbouringplaces, a great friendship had sprung up among them.Of no less force are the arguments brought forwardby the Sclavonians; for it is a well-established fact amongthem that the letters and characters, which they use at thepresent day, are very dissimilar from those of the Latins,Greeks, and Hebrews, and that they were received fromSt. Jerome, and were considered as his own invention; andthose from the Sclavonic tongue and in the selfsamecharacters were used by him in their Divine office, whichup to the present time they use, and which is the same aswe all follow, and which was confirmed by Pope Eugeniusin the Council of Florence. And even Blondus himselfdeclares that it was he who was the instrument of thesame, and that the affair had passed through his hands.Furthermore, as we shall see presently, he translated intothe same language the whole of the sacred Scriptures.From this they argue that, had the holy doctor been anItalian, he would never have boasted of so uncouth aI4THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEtongue, nor would he have given to his countrymen sucha singular language and letters.Those of Italy reply that itis not uncommon forpeoples on the frontiers to speak the language of theadjoining countries, and even of lands still farther removed,such as is the case in the Abruzzi and Calabria, where theGreek language has always been spoken, albeit the factthat it is a larger province than Istria; similarly, those whodwell in the valleys of the Alps generally speak French,and those of Verona and Vicenza, which are large cities,speak the Teutonic language, although they lie far distantfrom Germany. And in the same manner, either becauseIstria was so near to Sclavonia, or because, for a certainperiod, she was subject to Sclavonian rule, her peoplecame to speak the language of Sclavonia.In this contention, allowing that either party may beright in their claims, I deem that those speak and thinkwith truth, who declare that it is of minor importanceamong Christians whether the saint belonged to this orthat land, forasmuch as it be but an earthly consideration,rather should we wish to rise with him in a spiritual sense.And, without any manner of doubt, such would be a bettertitle-deed to the birthplace of the saint, and be more ofhis spirit to imitate him in his life and conversation.Ifthis latter test be accepted, I venture to say that St.Jerome should belong to Spain, since, in that country wesee under his name so saintly a religious order existing,and the most illustrious houses of that order throughoutEurope; in which communities for over 230 years, up tothe present (1595), his sons in Christ have, with singularobservance, devoted themselves to following the work helaboured in. These religious have always the sacred textson their lips, the divine praises are sung by them withoutintermission day and night; spiritual conferences and piousPARENTAGEI5questions divide their time. The Fathers also investigateand examine theological works in their original languages,in Hebrew and in Greek, drawing from their hiddendepths rare fruits. A great testimony to the truth ofwhat I say is the famous house of San Lorenzo el Real, aworthy work of Philip II., where, in what regards thedivine office and worship, sacred writings and letters styledscholastic and positive, the Hebrew, Greek, and Latintongues, this Order has attained such a high degree ofexcellence that I know not where greater proficiencyexists. Yet what in this holy institution is more the aim,and in which the greatest solicitude is sought, is to becomemost like their spiritual Father and founder, in thosethings which he excelled, namely, true perfection of life,the renunciation and forgetfulness of the world, retirement,mortification, and poverty.Hence, he who observes andlooks well into the rule of this manner of interior life, andnotes the fervour and constancy practised in the observanceof thestatutes and constitutions, will perceive (albeitoutwardly it may appear otherwise) that few of thereligious orders surpass this one, even such as arediscalced and follow strict observance.Therefore, whetherJerome be of Stridon, in Dalmatia, or he be of Istria,it makes very little difference, although the manner ofimitating this holy doctor in Spain far surpasses that ofother countries; for, of course, this contention onlyregards his birthplace.All the Fathers agree upon thefact that Jerome's parents were noble and wealthy, sincethey held landed property and possessed slaves.Thesaint himself gives us this to understand, as we shall seefarther on, for he sent his brother Paulinian to disposeof what little had escaped destruction at the hands of thebarbarians. And in another part of his writings he saysthat when a child he used on holidays to run about the16THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEspacious dwellings of the servants, and domestics of hisfather's household.According to Aristotle, nobility is divided into lineageand virtue, and, according to Socrates, into nobility ofbody and nobility of soul; all which good qualities wereunited in our saint. And in truth nobility of lineage isnot a thing of small moment, nor one to be omitted inthe lives of saints; because it is proper and in reason,says the same philosopher, that those born of parents ina higher class of society should be nobler and better thanothers of inferior rank. The name of Jerome's father, asthe holy doctor himself tells us, was Eusebius, and it wasappropriate that he should be so called, because, in itsoriginal signification, it means “Godliness,” and it is onlynatural that the shoot springing from that noble treeshould be Jerome, which in the Greek tongue signifies“holy law,” a fit presage of what he was to be; for, fromgodliness and religion springs the perfect knowledge ofthe divine law.It is a saying of God Himself that Hewill not enter into a wicked soul, but into a soul that ishumble, and which fears and loves Him, and is obedientto His divine precepts.It is a right and prudent counselfor parents to give their children appropriate names, sothat on hearing its name the child may call to mind theparticular virtue, which distinguished the saint whoseThus, when parentsname it bears, in order to practise it.call their son John or Joseph, and he hears his name, thereshould occur to his mind not only the virtue, which thefirst of these names indicate (unless he be so ignorantthereof that he knows not what the name implies), andhis soul is thereby refreshed, but there ought also to arisein his heart the desire of the divine grace, which distinguished him, and its increase, as is signified by theThis manner of naming children, insecond name.NAME17harmony with distinguished persons, was greatly practisedby the ancients, yet not with that vain respect ascribedto Pythagoras, who believed that in proper names therewas a singular value or power, whether the word consisted of many or few syllables, had even or odd numberof letters, and who supposed that in all this there wereenclosed good or evil results,—and so Terence informsus that from the power of his name Hector believedhimself bound to slay Patroclus, and he himself in turnwas to be killed by Achilles,'—for, as may well be perceived,this is all childishness, unworthy of Pythagoras.The proper reason is what we have stated.ThusAristotle interpreted his name to mean that he should donothing but that which would tend to an honest end, andwhat would help him to attain it with due perfection.Socrates likewise drew from his name the interpretationthat he should keep himself and all those, with whom heconversed, healthy and safe, not only from bodily ailments,but also from those of the soul.Pythagoras and Plutarchinterpreted their destinies in like manner. The first wastold that his name implied that, in order to be a goodpreceptor, it was not sufficient only to speak and to feel,but that he must have also the power to persuade men tovirtue; and the second one, that he must seek for trueriches, which time could not corrupt.In the same waymight we philosophise of many others, and of our ownJerome among them, and we shall see how in after life heacted up to the goodly name which was given him, whenhe was consecrated to God, in order that he should everI admit that weponder on His holy and sacred law.should not in all cases assign a mystery to names, butonly when God assigns them to us, or changes them inorder to manifest His divine will, or when parents give1 Pliny.C18THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEtheir child a name, in order to recall some especial event,which may have taken place at the birth (for both thesemanners of naming do we observe in the sacred writings);but when we perceive that the life and the course ofevents correspond in all things to the surname of aperson, we may prudently infer (as dialecticians say) thatit was a thing arranged by God that he should be sonamed. And He Who in time, and from before all time,had pre-ordained the lives of the saints, what marvel thatHe should have also assigned their respective names?This is evident from the long catalogue of examples wemight make of names, not only found in the Old Testament—for we might be told that these were no more thanfigures—but also those of the New Testament, and evenin more recent times when we see such names as Lawrence,Stephen, Vincent, Dominic, Benedict, Bernard, Ambrose,and hundreds of others, whose lives so admirably corresponded to their names.It is related of Domitius, thefather of Nero, that on being congratulated upon the birthof the son who was born to him, not only did he notmanifest joy at the news, but with a sad countenancereplied: “It is not possible that from me and Agrippinathere can be born anything but what will be pernicious tothe republic.” What a true and dire prognostic! Andon the contrary, how well might the parents of oursaint rejoice, as did the parents of the Baptist, whosefather being called Zachary, which means “remembranceof God,” and his mother, Elizabeth, which is equal to“the Lord hath sworn,” it might be inferred that the newborn child was a “messenger of the Lord,” and, as itwere, the harbinger of grace and mercy, whom God wasminded to show to His people, as He had promised andsworn to do.The same may be predicted in regard to our saint,NAME19that he would prove a general benefit to the world; forJerome to be son of Eusebius is a true promise that frompiety should spring forth great fruits out of the sacredlaw.What was the name of his mother the saint has notinformed us; he simply states that both his parents wereChristians. He had an aunt, sister of his mother, whowas called Castorina, with whom he had some differencesit is supposed in regard to the division of the familyBe the reasoninheritance, but this seems unfounded.what it may, it is known with certainty that by letters heimplored her many times to allow her anger to pass away;and in the letters that remain to us of Jerome there isone of such good doctrine and advice that I deem it wiseto quote it here, because in the lives of saintly doctorstheir doctrine and writings are the best means of manifesting to us their souls.It runs as follows:—“The Apostle St. John, who wrote the Holy Gospel,in one of hisEpistles says—That he who hatethhis brother is a murderer, and with reason, because, asmurder generally springs from hatred, he that hates,although he may not have actually struck a blow withintent to kill, yet at least in his heart has killed hisfellow-being.You will say: ‘To what purpose is allthis?'Because, laying aside the former anger, let usprepare in our breasts a fit dwelling for the Lord, and, asDavid says, “Be angry and sin not, or as St. Paul morefully declares to us, ‘Let not the sun go down upon yourwrath.What then shall we do? On the last day inregard to ourselves what shall we answer over whoseanger the sun has never set P Our Lord says in theGospel: “If thou bringest thy gift to the altar, and therethou rememberest that thy brother hath something againstthee, leave there thy gift on the altar, and first go and be2OTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEreconciled to him, and then coming thou shalt offer thy gift.”Alas ! unhappy that I am ! not to say thou also ! who for solong a time have not offered the holy sacrifice on the altar,or, if I did offer it, the fire of anger being still alive, the giftwas as though it were worthless | What do we say inthat prayer we so often repeat: “Lord, forgive us ourtrespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us'?For the words are so far removed from what is felt in thesoul, and the prayer so contrary to deeds !I pray thee,therefore, again, as for more than a year I have besoughtthee by other letters, that the peace of the Lord, whichHe left us, we both may enjoy, for my desires and thysoul He Himself looks into, and, very shortly, before HisTribunal, either reconciliation and renewed friendship willhave its due reward, or the unforgiving anger and severedpeace will have its dire punishment, as to which peace,shouldst thou still not desire it, which may God forbid, Ishall remain free, because this my letter, on being read tothee, will leave me absolved of any fault.” Here we see thepurity of intention of the saint, and his desire for thatevangelical peace, which is so greatly commended to us.St. Jerome had also a sister, whose name he does notmention, and a brother, whose name was Paulinian, whowas the youngest member of the family. We shall speakof him later on in the course of the saint's life.Having thus described the country, parentage, andrelatives of St. Jerome, it now remains to ascertain, if itbe possible, when he was born, for opinions differ as to theprecise date of his birth, and in truth we have onlyconjecture to guide us, and with which to build a theory.Some say he was born in the fifteenth year of the Empireof Constantine the Great, others say in the twenty-fifthyear, and others again on the thirty-first, which was theSigisbertus, Beda, Prosper, Erasmus.DATE OF BIRTH2Ilast year of his Empire. There are others, again, whohold that he was born during the empire of Constantius,the son of Constantine, who governed, according toOrosius, for twenty-four years.This opinion appears tobe nearest the truth, albeit it may be contrary to thecommon belief, for it even would seem stated by thelearned doctor himself; for when writing his Commentarieson Habacuc, he says, when expounding the words of theprophet—Maledixsti sceptris effus capiti bellatorum effus:“I being at that time yet a lad, studying the principlesof grammar, all the cities were running with the blood ofthe victims when the news suddenly arrived, in the midstof the heat and fury of the persecution, that JulianAugustus was dead.” Then one of the infidels wittilysaid: “I know not how these Christians can say thattheir God is most patient and long-suffering, for I knownot what wrath could have been more suddenly manifested, because not so much as for a short space of timedid he stay His vengeance.” From this we can arguethat if Julian held the Empire for no more than two years,(a fact which is well known and proved), and seeing thatour saint was so young that he was still learning therudiments of grammar, and, at most, could be no morethan fourteen or fifteen years of age, it appears certainthat he must have been born in the tenth or twelfth yearof the Empire of Constantius, and by no possibility in thetime of Constantine, and about the year 345 of the birthThis is the most certain date we can offerof our Lord.in a matter so obscure. He studied in the house of hisparents some of the parts of grammar, and had a preceptorso severe that he called him Oróilius in allusion to themaster of Horace the poet, using towards him the sameepithet, calling him plagosus, because no doubt he whippedEpist. 41.22THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEearliesthim sorely. From this tutor, and more so from his mostpious parents, he learned the law and the Christian faith,together with good and saintly customs; for it is of greatimportance that children should learn these things fromtheiryears, imbibing them even with theirmother's milk, in order that both soul and body shouldgrow up together well and healthy, the soul in Christianvirtues and the body in strength of members.Togetherwith Jerome another youth was brought up, whose namewas Bonosus; they loved one another tenderly, they werefoster-brothers, and the same nurse would carry themboth in her arms; together they learned their first letters,and together they grew up to be young men, and together(as we shall declare later on) they departed to live in thedesert, as Jerome himself, in almost the self-same words,makes mention when writing to Rufinus."Habacuc, c. iii. v. 14.DISCOURSE THE SECONDThe Parents of St. Jerome send him to Rome to pursue hisStudies. What these Studies were, and what the Saintdid.THE holy youth, being well instructed in the Christianreligion and in the first rudiments of letters, had arrivedat an age when he began to give ample testimony of hisgenius and of his qualities; hence his parents and his wisepreceptor, in view of his natural abilities and quickness ofunderstanding, together with the good habits and piousinclinations, which even from his tender age he manifested,decided to send him to Rome to follow higher studies,because, although good letters flourished in France, inSpain, and in Africa at that time, and many learned menwere known to exist in those countries, nevertheless, inwhat regarded the purity of the Latin tongue, a greatdegeneration had taken place since early times. And inRome, as in its fountain and source, the language wasbetter preserved and far less corrupted than elsewhere,although not with its pristine splendour; furthermore, asregarded the study of other languages as well as thecultivation of sound doctrine in all its purity, Rome wasalways held as the mother and well-spring of learning, andwill continue to be so.This wise arrangement on thepart of his parents he later on greatly praises when speakingof the mother of Rusticus, the monk, who, after sending2324THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEher son for some time to pursue his studies in France,where learning and belles lettres flourished at that period,he was sent, like our Jerome, to Rome to conclude hiseducation, and so that he might receive the good resultsof both schools of learning. On this point the parents ofJerome acted very prudently, and thus the reproach couldnot be cast against them as was done to that Romanartist, who painted well the surface, but not so his figures,since they all turned out so plain.Because, although itbe not in the power of parents to have children beautifulin countenance, yet they possess in themselves a greatpower of rendering them beautiful in soul, infusing intothem by means of counsels and examples, good and holycustoms; filling them, as we have said above, by means ofright masters, with good science, and not allowing them tobe like blank boards, whereon nothing is written, or similarto huge blocks.This condition we notice very much in regard to thenobles of the epoch, who considered it then quite advisable that their children should grow up in ignorance,believing that all can be covered up by wealth and theestates to be bequeathed to them; as a philosopher said,it was “like a sheath of gold holding a wooden sword,”and in the end these ignorant nobles become the laughingstock of the world.Hence, for this reason did theseprudent parents of Jerome seek to withdraw their gifted,youthful son from all the blandishments of the worldwhen yet in his early boyhood, despite that he was theeldest-born and the heir, and, moreover, the best-lovedchild of the family, in order that so exalted an intellectshould not be wasted, andthey were ready even todeprive themselves of his company, and to send him towhere he should find a proper and wide sphere forcarrying out the promises of his genius, since it is nothingSTUDIES IN ROME25short of the highest importance to establish well the firstprinciples of science, and to form the mind to what isnoble and good, so that the taste for goodness and truewisdom should ever increase.In most of the first-born and heirs mentioned in theOld Testament we notice failure, and in not a few casesalso in people of our own time. Cain was the first-born ofAdam, and our wicked brother. To Abraham was givenIshmael as his first-born, and in the house of Isaac Esauwas forestalled. To Jacob Reuben was not the best ofbrothers, and Eliab, the first-born of Jesse, was not, inthe eyes of God, so good as the last of his children, whowas David; nor did the latter witness good success in hisson Ammon, who was the first-born of his children, andmany others in like manner.I am well aware that in allthese instances there was hidden some especial mystery;nevertheless we can well affirm that these heirs were evilthrough their own malice, and from this fact, as well asfrom the neglecting to correct them in their evil customs,we may well declare that the cause was due to their havingbeen brought up too delicately, their parents having lovedthem unduly, allowing them to follow their course of evilrather than thwart and reprimand them, and, being treatedwith too much deference, they grew up in their pride,and by degrees, with the strength of years, their evilinclinations begat such lamentable results.But thesediscreet parents of the saint already foresaw that Godhad given them this son, not merely for their own benefit,but for the common good of the world, and to be a widespreading light in the Church, and thus they sent him atan early age to Rome, the common mother of thechurches. There he learned Latin and Greek with thehappy success we perceive in his works.In doing thishe followed the advice of Quinctilian, because the Latin26THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEtongue softens the uncouthness of the Greek language.In these studies he had as his chief preceptors Donatus,the author of the Commentaries on Virgil and Terence, ashe himself declares in his Apologia against Rufinus. “Ibelieve,” he says, “you must have read the Commentariesof Aspius upon Virgil and Sallust, and those of Volcaciuson the Orations of Cicero, those of Victorinus upon theDialogues, and those of my master Donatus on theComedies of Terence and Virgil.” Some say that hismaster for rhetoric was Victorinus, yet it clearly seemsmanifest that it was not so, because, albeit at times he maysay our Victorinus, that does not mean to say that he washis master, but it was a common speech of his, in order todistinguish the Greeks from the Latins, which former hecalls ours.also proved that Victorinus taughtrhetoric in the time of Constantinus, as the doctor himselfdeclares in the catalogue of illustrious men, at which time,as we have shown, he was either not yet born, or wasso young that he could not yet have gone to Rome. Andin the Additions to Eusebius, he says: “Victorinus, therhetorician, and Donatus, our master, are renowned inRome and held in high esteem. The former—Victorinus—merited to have a statue erected to his honour in theNaturally in this place he would haveforum of Trajan.”said “my preceptors,” if both had been so, and this samemethod of speaking of them in other places is followedby him.ItisThe time spent in Rome he did not employ solelyin the study of human letters; rather he employed athose, to which Heaven hadgreat portion of italready inclined him; that is to say, in such things asappertained to piety and the higher virtues. He frequentlyresorted to the churches, visiting the hallowed cemeteries,the sepulchres of the holy martyrs, in which that greatinSTUDIES IN ROME27city so abounded, for during this early period of his lifehis exercises were already those of a more mature age.This he himself tells us with his usual sweetness, whenwriting on the prophet Ezechiel he expounds the vision ofthe Temple, which the Prophet saw, which, becomingvery difficult and pondering on its obscurity and the littlelight he had for working out its exposition with clearness,he makes an allusion to this effect: “Being in Rome,when quite a young boy, I learnt there human letters,and very frequently, along with other young students,companions of about my own age, we used, on Feast days,to go and visitthe sepulchres of the Apostles andOftentimes we would enter into those caves,Martyrs.descend into subterranean places, and such as enter themfeel naught else on both sides of the wall but the bodiesof the buried dead, and the whole is so shrouded indarkness that the words become verified there which werespoken by the prophet, ‘let the living descend into hell.'Sometimes we saw windows, but so far away that theywere like loopholes in the heights. Through these a dimlight would penetrate, which somewhat lessened theobscurity and the shadows, and resembled more murkyholes than windows. On passing quickly out of thesesubterranean vaults there follows another spell of darkness, and it needs caution to enter the next cave step bystep, because one is surrounded by the darkness of night,reminding one of the words of Virgil—Souls with such horror surrounded,Together in silence stand terrified.”,It is remarkable how the inclinations of boyhood revealthe nobleness of the soul, and in the first efforts and trialsof earliest childhood the promise of future years becomediscovered, because beings at that age allow themselves28THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEto be ruled by impulse, and no considerations avail todeter them.From this pious exercise above described we mayconjecture what was the generous emulation of this saintlyyouth—an emulation proper to young men of high andlofty ideals.When he walked along these hallowed places, envelopedin darkness, and touched in the sacred gloom the bodies ofthe martyrs, I can well imagine how in thought he wouldcry out: “Oh that I also were a martyr ! and that mybones might merit the honour of being laid here in thisgoodly company, and my soul be one day dwelling withtheirs in the same happy mansions as they do after havingsuffered martyrdom for Christ! Oh that the ministers ofthis apostate Julian would come here now and take me aprisoner, because I am a Christian, and let me suffer athousand torments in so just a cause !I beseech Thee,O God, that there may be glorious witnesses to thedivine truth, to the gospel and the Christian law, in orderthat, through the merits of Jesus Christ, I may be baptized—first in the Holy Ghost, and then in the fire of persecution and in my blood!”If this emulation in a child was able to effect somuch in the heart of Alexander the Great, when he wasbut a boy, on witnessing the deeds done by his fatherPhilip, that he burst into a flood of tears because no moredeeds remained to him to execute, what ardour must nothave been aroused in the breast of Jerome when hepondered on the example left to us by those now lifelessbodies, which in life had so gloriously fought for Christ,and had obtained such signal victories for Him? Withoutdoubt his generous soul did not deceive him, nor, indeed,had God preserved his life for any lesser deeds than thosewhich the martyrs had performed.STUDIES IN ROME29Returning to our purpose, I say, that when pursuingthese early studies he attained to a greater and higherknowledge of Latin and Greek than was deemed necessaryin those times, and he therefore passed on to other studies,and with a marvellous subtlety penetrated science andattained a deeper insight than others could obtain duringmany years of study, for we see manifested in him anadmirable love of discipline, and in each branch of learninghe excelled as though all his efforts had been directedThese truths will be plainly perceivedtowards it alone.by such as read with attention his writings, because thesegrand talents are manifest throughout the vast extent ofhis works. Of rhetoric I will only say of it what is stated,and what he himself declares, when he affirms that heexercised himself greatly in this science; and this will bemore fully explained farther on, when the proper placeoffers itself. Of dialectics, which are, as it were, the guideto show the road to other teachings, I wish it to be understood, in some sense, how greatly he laboured in order torefute what is said by some, who judge that the science ofdialectics is not mastered unless a man speaks in termsand expressions that are barbaric, and which had its originin the miserable ages, when literature was sadly draggedalong the ground.I confess that this the saint did notknow, because I do not find it in Aristotle, nor in Hippocrates, Porphyrius, Alexander, and others from whom he tellsus he studied logic. When writing to Domion, in respectto certain advice he gives him, of a daring little monk, whohad reprehended certain things which the saintly doctorhad written in a book against Jovinian, he says: “Yourletters partake of both love and complaints—love, becausewarning me with all earnestness even of such things asare in me secure. You dread the complaints of such asare not lovers of good, and who seek occasions of sin, and3oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEscorn their brethren, and set scandal against the very sonof their mother. You write to me that a certain monk, orrather a nobody, who wanders about in streets and squares,a lover of sowing novelties, a stinging talker, a murmurerof evil speeches, one who having a beam in his own eyeyet wishes to draw forth the mote out of mine, who ceasesnot to preach in bands against me and of the books I wroteagainst Jovinian, is always biting with the fury of a dog:this dialectician of your city, a great personage in the familyof Plautus, most certainly has never read the Categories ofAristotle, nor the Perihermenios, nor the Topics, nor eventhe quotations of Cicero, read only by mobs of vulgar peopleand conventicles of women; yet he forms and composessyllogisms, as though what I had said were fallacies orsophistries of small importance, and assumes by this meansto undo them.Oh, ignorant that I am! Who deemedthat these things could not be known but through thephilosophers? and dolt that I was, who so often wouldread with greater zest that which I had to correct, andIn vain,even blot out, than that which I had to write.therefore, did I undertake to translate the Commentariesof Alexander, and in vain was it that my master, as one thatis learned in teaching, tookme right through the Introduction(Isagoge) of Porphyrius on to the logic of Aristotle; and invain (leaving aside what concerns the liberal arts) did I haveas my masters in the holy Scriptures Gregory NazianzenNor has the erudition of the Hebrews beenand Didymus.of any advantage to me, nor the continual meditation andreflection which I have practised ever since I was a youthup to the present time on the law, on the prophets, on thegospels and the epistles of the apostles; for we have comeacross a man who was perfect without a master, somedivine spirit,-or else some fanatical imp has entered intothe soul of the same, and of himself he has come forthSTUDIES IN ROME3Iwell qualified and taught, surpassing in eloquence Cicero,in argument Aristotle, in prudence and solidity Plato, inerudition Aristarchus, in the fulness of book-lore Origen,and in the science of the sacred letters Didymus.”From this is manifestly seen whether he studied inearnest dialectics in right style and good order, and likeone, who was well versed in them, notices the deficiency ofthe same in Rufinus, telling him in the Apologia that heknew not what it was to divide, or define, and styles himEpicurean, because those of that sect paid but little attention to this study. The most conclusive proof of Jerome'sknowledge in dialectics would be to read his books withattention, for he who should take any pleasure in doing sowould find in the Treatises against Vigilantius, Helvidius,Jovinian, and others, that the force and sinews of hisreasoning, the facility with which he refutes his opponents,is themanifests great subtlety in this science, and itfinished style with which, in so lofty a manner, he carriesit through, that never allows an improper word to lower asingle point of the dignity of the oration, from which theignorant (who do not attain to this)" think that there areno dialectics there; and they speak the truth when theyrefer to their own.It is a remark often made by men of little piety, andreligious and modest men, such asothers, respectingour saint, that they were very free of speech, and toooverbearing for saints, and other things which can onlybe taken as coming from such lips as theirs, which arewont to speak with but little respect of the saints; andthis remark they found more especially in this very Epistlewe have quoted.They do not perceive, or do not wishto perceive, the reason the saint had for speaking as hedid, which was the upholding of the authority of theErasmus, in Epist. 51.32THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEChurch, and the defending of her holy doctrines anddogmas against those, who, as daring as they are deficientin erudition, both in human letters as in the divine,assume to follow or invent new doctrines; and with equaldaring speak and write publicly as in secret againstthose, who defend the cause of the Church.Against suchas these there is no more prudent course to take than totreat them as they deserve, paying no attention to them,and in passing undo the fallacy of their foundations, andthus enable the world to see their ignorance, in order thatthe masses, which are the more easily imposed upon,should understand the truth and be enlightened, and notbe blindly induced to follow every new idea and inventionThis our saint did, in his Apologeticof ambitious men.Epistle against the said monk of the public squares andstreets, which was a happy conjunction of terms, “Monkand Rover,” when it ought to be “Solitary and Cloistered.”In these refutations our great Father performs the officeof doctor and master of the Church according to theinjunction of St. Paul the Apostle, who said that teachersof divine truths should be steadfast and safe in doctrine,and should be able to refute such as attempt to contradictthe teaching of holy Church, thus manifesting to the worldtheir insufficiency.

When, in the course of time and in the fulnessof age, he perceived how vain and of what small importance were the books of the Gentiles, for, being full ofopinions and containing little science, their writings clearlymanifested their ambitions and the obscurity of theirdoctrine, he forthwith withdrew from them.For it seemedto him, as was the case, that there was more philosophyin a few lines of Moses, Job, Solomon, and Isaias thanin all the philosophers together, as he himself declares inthe proem to his Commentaries on the last-named prophet.”And writing on Nahum, he compares those, who devotethemselves solely to the philosophy of the Gentiles, tobruchus and locusts, who have wings, but which neverenable them to rise higher than the brambles and hedges,nor can their flight be long continued without comingdown to the ground.Such are those, who solely conferwith Chrysippus and Aristotle, whose works, owing to theirintricacies and crudeness, are comparable to the buckthornand bramble, which keep them well entangled.In other parts of his writings he says" that thesephilosophers are useful for awakening a desire to find thetruth, but are not able to satisfy that desire; or, again,they may be compared to the woman who was troubledwith the issue of blood, who had spent her means inpaying physicians who never cured her, because they didnot understand the cause of the ailment, and who wasnever healed until she touched the hem of Christ's garSo also is it with those who seek to appeasement.their desires by perusing Plato and Aristotle, from whichis proved how cleverly he, with his genius, had encomAnd would to God that with such sanepassed them.1 Proem in Isai.Capit. 3 in Nahum.Psalm cvi. tom. 7.36THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEcounsels those would be disillusioned, who think they haveacquired truth after having spent much time and wasted oil,yet do not perceive their waste.What is included in the science of topography, or thedescription of places, and in its train geometry, which isnecessary to it, our doctor attained to fathom in anexcellent manner, as is proved by the description hegives of the various places mentioned in the Scriptures,and in a more especial manner those of the Holy Land.Because, although he saw them and walked in them, nevertheless as we shall see farther on, had he not had anentire knowledge of the way to describe them, it wouldnot have sufficed; as is the case with many, who go onpilgrimages, and who pass through provinces and kingdoms and strange lands, yet are unable to afford a truerdescription than those who saw them not; and thesestudies are not acquired at the moment when they arerequired, but have to be learned a long time in anticipation. He who should read his Commentaries on Ezechielwill find in the last part how learned St. Jerome was ingeometry from the information he affords when he alludesto and agreestheexplorers and spies sent by Joshua to the promised landof God were geometricians, because otherwise they wouldhave been unable to bring back such information as wasneeded.with what Josephus says,thatThe knowledge he possessed of chronology and history,sciences so necessary when treating on theology and controversial arguments, was also extensive, as is frequentlymanifested in the course of his writings, more especiallyin the last part of his Commentaries on Daniel, in whichhe expounds all those things which so many agespreviously had been foretold by the Prophets, and whichThishe demonstrates to have been fulfilled to the letter.STUDIES IN ROME37is declared by the historians, not only the Greek ones,such as Suetonius, Callimachus, Diodorus, Polybius, Posidonius, Claudius Andronicus, and Josephus, but even bythe Latins, such as Titus Livy, Tacitus, Justinian, andothers. And the large knowledge he had of history canbe well seen from the continual allusions he makes of itAll these did Jerome study in Rome, andat every step.more especially in order to know how to adorn andembellish theology with all the elegance of both the Latinand Greek languages.It was a happy inspiration from Heaven that he shouldthus earnestly pursue these studies at this period of hislife, because up to his time amongst the doctors of theLatin Church theology was, so to speak, but in its infancy;and although many understood that science well, yet comparatively few could speak about it, or adorn it with theFor which cause sacredraiment it demanded in reason.things were subjects of indifference to many, since theyfound them so bereft of ornament, and thus they read profanebooks with greater interest than they did religious ones.Moreover, the learned among the Gentiles (for even atthat period there were many) called Christians “Infants,”scorning them as ignorant persons, who knew not evenHence, by the pursuit of these studieshow to speak.and the great erudition of our Jerome these wants werein a great measure remedied, inasmuch as the divineletters were treated of and expounded by him in suchlofty language and clear style that many of the greatestgeniuses of the Gentiles delighted to read what waswritten by St. Jerome so that it might be truly said, thatthe whole of Gentile wisdom placed on one side, opposed toa Jerome of the Christians was able to stand alone on theother side, nor could any be found to surpass him in eruditionHis companions in these studiesand in elegance of style.38THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwere Pammachius, a Roman of high rank, who marriedPaulina, daughter of St. Paula, and after her death becamea monk.This Pammachius lived so saintly a life inthe monastic state, and was so esteemed by the Romanpeople for his virtue that he would have been electedPope;' but, as the saintly doctor himself says, “It was ahigher honour to merit the dignity than to possess it.”His other companion was Bonosus, of whom we have saidin part of our narrative that he had been brought up withhim. He also, like Pammachius, was of noble parentage,and, as we shall see farther on in this history, he toobecame a holy monk. The third companion was Heliodorus, who, on account of his exalted sanctity and virtue,attained to be a bishop, as the same Father declares in theIntroduction he wrote upon Abdias, in which, regrettingthat certain commentaries, full of allegories, which he hadwritten in his youth upon the Prophet, should have beenpublished, and had been distributed among the people, hesays as follows: “This was done, my Pammachius, morebeloved to me than the light, at the time when, havingjust quitted the schools of the rhetoricians, we gave ourselves up to the study of divers sciences; and when I andHeliodorus, our beloved, were projecting to withdraw fromthe world, and to live together in solitude and prayer inthe desert of Chalcidia in Syria.” From which words wehave a clear proof of what we have stated in this discourserespecting the studies and mode of discipline that ourglorious saint undertook at this period of his life.Epist. 52.DISCOURSE THE THIRDThe Baptism of St. Jerome in Rome.The Reason whyBaptism was deferredWE have seen the manner in which St. Jerome employedhis time in Rome during the period of infancy and puberty—his extensive studies, the great progress he made inthem; his holy inclinations and pious customs. As a consequence of these good qualities God inspired his heartwith the desire to receive baptism, and no longer to delaydoing so, for He wished to raise him up to higher things,and to employ him for the good of His Church. Touchedby this holy thought, he was not slow in carrying out thisdesire, nor did he turn a deaf ear to the voice of God, butrather, raising his eyes to heaven full of tears of joy andgratitude, in humility of soul and with uplifted hands hegave thanks to the Father of Lights, from whom proceeded that sovereign gift. He felt so full of fervour withthis desire that he at once resolved upon sending in hisname to be placed among the number of catechumens, whoIn those days this was thewere candidates for baptism.After giving in their names they werefirst ceremony.no longer styled “catechumens,” but “competents” and“elected,” because they were then separated from theothers to be instructed and prepared for baptism, in contradistinction to the other catechumens, who were only called“audientes,” “listeners,” like those who wished to become394OTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEChristians, and attended the sermons and discourses onthe Christian life and religion, but had not yet demandedbaptism. Thus does our saint style them himself in theEpistle he wrote to his friend Pammachius, where he complains of John of Jerusalem, because the candidates or“competents” whom he (Jerome) had himself presented tohim to be baptized had not been permitted to receivebaptism on the holy day of Easter.St. Augustine, inlike manner, applies to them” this name, as a name wellaccepted, in his book De Cura pro Mortuis and in otherparts of his writings; and St. Leo Pope,” in his fourthEpistle and elsewhere, also designates the aspirants tobaptism by this name, although he more commonly callsthem “elect.”This was, as it were, in imitation of the earthlyMilitia called delecti who submitted their names to beregistered, which was done by taking the oath of fealty toobey the Emperor, and which was the military pledge.To this similarly does St. Paul allude when he calls thefaithful by the name of “soldiers,” and arms them withsword, breastplates, shields, helmets, and the rest ofmilitary accoutrements.Having, therefore, given in his name as a candidate forbaptism our Jerome passed on to his examinations. Therewere seven examinations held to test candidates in theirfirmness of belief in the faith and renunciation of theAll the saints from St.devil, the world, and its vanities.Dionysius the Areopagite to St. Clement Pope mention thisholy and necessary ceremony of the examinations as beingof apostolic tradition, and as having been taught by JesusChrist Himself Who said that unless a man renounces allthat he possesses he cannot become His disciple; for no1 Epist. 61.August. cap. 12, lib. De Cura pro Mortuis.Leo Papa, Epist. 4, 5, 6.BAPTISM IN ROME41man can serve two masters which are so contrary to oneanother—God and the World,—albeit that lay Christiansof our time pretend that it can be done, despite thatFrequently doesChrist Himself says it cannot be done.our Father mention this ceremony, and in a more especialmanner does he speak concerning it when commenting onthe last words of the sixth chapter of Amos where he says:“Unless evil works die within us, Christ will not rise in useither, for only when we are dead to sin shall we possessFor this reason in the “mysteries'Him for our guide.(for thus did they style the sacrament of baptism) we firstrenounce Him who hath power over the West, and withhim put to death sin in us, and, turning to the East, weenter into our engagement, taking the oath to abide bythe Sun of Justice, promising to serve Him.”From these words is pointed out to us another ceremonywhich was then in use, namely the custom which the newlybaptized observed of turning their backs to the West topray, so that their faces should thus be looking to theEast, in order to give us to understand that in everysense of the word the back must be turned on sin, whichcustom, however, is not now in use; nor that one whichhe mentions when commenting on Isaias, and in otherplaces, which was that of giving to newly-baptized personsmilk and honey to eat in sign that they were new creaturesin Christ.And whereas some of these ceremonies notbeing universal nor of apostolic tradition, as were others,but only observed in some few special churches, they fellinto disuse, similarly as that most renowned ceremony,of which some memory still remains, which was ofvesting the newly baptized in white garments fromHoly Saturday, when the baptism had taken place,until Low Sunday.This practice the saint mentionsseveral times, more especially in two of his letters written42THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEfrom the desert of Chalcidia to Pope Damasus, wherein heinforms him very touchingly that he had clothed himselfin the robe of Christ in Rome, and that it was but inreason that from Rome should be sent him the food of thespirit, since it was there that he had received the new lifeof the soul; by these words alluding, like a good philosopher, to the natural principle which teaches that fromthe causes whence a thing springs of the same does itmaintain itself.This is in truth no small title-deed forRome to claim this saint as her own, since the Christian'snative land is rather where he is born again of the newAdam which is Christ, than of the country of the oldAdam, where he was born of his natural parents. Sovividly did all these holy ceremonies remain impressed inhis thoughts, and so fittingly did these white garmentsbecome his body and soul, in which he was clothed on hisgreat birthday, that sooner than soil them or spot theirwhiteness, as is said of the ermine, he would have allowedhimself to be subjected to untold torments.In those early times of the Church it was customary todelay baptism for some time, and not unfrequently until aperson had attained to manhood he did not receive baptism.This was done, not because among Christians and thosewell instructed in the evangelical doctrines there existedan objection to children being eligible for baptism at anytime after birth, because on this point there was never adoubt, as the same doctor himself teaches' in the thirdbook against the Pelagians, and all the other saints andmany councils’ declare as being of apostolic tradition whichhas been handed down from the beginning,” and of no lessauthority than ifNevertheless,notwithstanding that many parents who were faithful, andit had been written.1 Lib. 3, Contra Pelag. c. 6.Triden. ses. 6, can. 12.Milen. can. 2.Gerund. can. 5.BAPTISM IN ROME43even saintly persons, yet they did not baptize their children,nor did they themselves, after arriving at an age whenthey knew well what they were about, demand baptism,rather they deferred it for a long time, for what reason itis not easy to account.Without doubt they were movedby various aims, because good and saintly men and suchas had most pious parents, like St. Gregory Nazianzen, St.Ambrose, Basil, Augustin, and others of whom we havegrave and positive histories, did defer baptism, and put itoff until they were of full age, and received it only afterbeing many years catechumens, with this consideration,viz., that it was necessary for so high and great a sacrament to possess an exalted and lofty state of virtue, and tobe well advanced and practised in all the virtues demandedby Christian perfection.“Because,” as St. Chrysostom’says, “if it be necessary in order to dye cloth an imperialpurple to steep the wool in various tints first, and then inthe purple dye so that the cloth should acquire the perfecthue of colour desired, so also isit necessary for theperfection and the attainment of the exalted height of theChristian life, which exceeds in sanctity and purity allother states in the world, not to trust the soul ere it hasbeen exercised, and, as it were, been dyed first aswool by the practice of the moral virtues which form thefirm foundation of a state, which can be raised to so lofty aheight.”St. Augustine to the same purpose is fired withwrath, and with his divine genius puts forth many arguments against such as with little or no preparation, orprovision of virtues, nor sorrow for their past sins and life,should dare to receive baptism, and censures bishops andparish priests, who admitted to so divine a mystery men of illregulated lives, merely on their word that they were membersof the faithful, and that they believed in Jesus Christ.Homil. 1 in Acta.44THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEFrom these extracts will be gathered that the reasonthe saints had for deferring baptism was on account ofthe reverence in which they held this high state, andthe great respect and fear they judged necessary forentering into so holy and saintly a life. These considerations undoubtedly influenced the Christian parents of ourdoctor in delaying the baptism of their son, and likewiseurged them to send him at so early an age to Rome, inorder that he should be there well instructed in the faith,and adorned by saintly habits, be made competent topractise much discipline, and rendered fit to receive thevarious tints so firmly, that he should attain to beingsteeped in the perfection of the Christian purple.Others,however, let us say here, did not act with such goodmotives, but delayed receiving baptism until they werefar advanced in life, or indeed until they were at the verygates of death, similarly to the neglectful Christians ofthese times, who wait to do penance when they shouldbe making their wills, and by the judgment of God doneither the one nor the other; nor can any one be foundto convince them that they are dying, or persuade themto confess.Thus it came to pass in those days thatmany died without baptism, as occurred to the EmperorValentinian, the Younger, of whom St. Ambrose affirms,that he did not lose the grace he hoped for in baptism, onaccount of the true penance and good dispositions, whichsupplied with the spirit the want of water for receiving thesacrament he desired.In many other cases, without doubt,this did not end with such happy results in punishment oftheir neglect; and in endeavouring to remedy this, manyfell into a greater error, which was, that the dead werebaptized in the person of their friends, or they left arecommendation to them, founding this act on a false interpretation given to those words of St. Paul, where, writingBAPTISM IN ROME45to the Corinthians, he says: “Otherwise what shall they do,that are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not again 2Why, then,And St.are they baptized for them P'Epiphanius,” writing against Cerinthus, says “that thiswas the practice in Asia and in Galatia.”St. Chrysostom,when expounding this passage of the Apostle, recountsconcerning this practice which he with good reason callsworthy of scorn and derision, that, among the other errorsand abuses which sprang up from the heresy and sect ofthe Marcionites, was the following one: “When a persondied unbaptized a living man would lie under the bed ofthe dead man, and when the corpse was approached andasked whether he desired baptism, he, being dead andtherefore unable to reply, the man concealed beneath thebed would reply for him, and the dead man was thenbaptized, and that this is what St. Paul alludes to when hesays, “What shall they do, that are baptized for the dead?’“To such a degree,” says the saint, “does the craft ofthe devil work on the souls of the ignorant.” To St.Epiphanius it appears a fair exposition of this passagethat, when a man is near his end, and at the point of death,if he had been already instructed in the faith, he can bebaptized, and that this may mean the words being baptizedfor the dead.It is, however, the opinion of others, thatSt. Paul here speaks of those, who do penance for the soulsof the departed, and that he speaks of baptism as thoughit were the same as a work of satisfaction; but I cannotsee how this agrees with the intention and words of theApostle.And, whereas it be not outside the purpose ofhistory, I will state what others again say, who in myopinion judge in respect to this text what is just in regardto the dignity of so great a master.Here he propounds agrave argument to prove the resurrection of the dead1 I Cor. xv. 29.Epipn. heres. 28.Homilia 40.46THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEIn the blissfulgathered from the secret mystery of the baptism of JesusChrist, where the dipping beneath the water and bringingforth of the baptized signified death, life, resurrection, andfirst ages of the Church itburial.happened that some of the faithful, previous to beingbaptized,Holy Ghost, as waswitnessed with Cornelius and all those of his household,for, ere St. Peter had concluded his discourse, the HolySpirit had descended on them and had given them thegift of tongues.visibly receivedtheBy this was clearly seen that they had died to sin andhad risen, as regards the souls of all those, who had thusreceived the Spirit, and thatthese had been dead,despoiled of that life, wherein they had first lived to sin,and were now risen to a new life in Christ.HenceSt. Paul asks: ‘Tell me, these that were dead to sin, whyWhat death or what lifewere they afterwards baptized?do they possess in that baptism P'For seeing they bemen so holy and so enlightened by the Holy Ghost theyperform naught without reason and without mystery, it isevident that they confess and profess not only that theydied with Christ, and that they have risen with Him, asregards the soul, but that they also await another death,and another resurrection of the body, which they professby receiving baptism, entering into and coming forth outof the water.Hence two lives and two deaths are thereprefigured, and in the cause also the effects are contained:as regards him who has already died and lived in the one, itbecomes necessary that he profess the other, and were thereno resurrection of the dead and of the body, there would benothing left for them to profess.This is what is taughtus by the Church in her creed, when she bids us say: “Iconfess one baptism for the remission of sins, and I expectthe resurrection of the dead.”This is the explanation.BAPTISM IN ROME47baptismreceivingcarelessnessBut let us return again to the case of those whoorthroughdelayedI say that of this number some were lednegligence.by a wrong interpretation of other words of the sameApostle' when in his Epistle to the Hebrews he says asfollows: “It is impossible for those, who were once illuminated,have tasted also the heavenly gift, and were made partakersof the Holy Ghost, have, moreover, tasted the good word ofGod and the powers of the world to come, and are fallenaway, to be renewed again to penance, crucifying againto themselves the Son of God, and making Him a mockery.'They understood this passage as though the Apostle hadsaid that he who, after being baptized, should sin mortally,had no means of returning to the grace of God, nor ofdoing penance; and hence they did not wish to bebaptized until the point of death. With this false interpretation did a priest of Rome called “Novatus” deceivemany.This ignorant innovator and explainer of holyScripture, not knowing that the same St. Paul, who hadsaid the above, had, nevertheless, received to penance theincestuous man of the city of Corinth; and that in thecase of the Galatians, who had been seduced and led awayby the teaching of a false gospel, he caused them to bespiritually born again by reason of the penance theyperformed, as is very clearly described, and the errorrefuted by the great Athanasius in an Epistle he addressedto Serapion. What the Apostle meant to say in this placehe himself declares subsequently in cap. xi. of the sameletter where he says: “By wilfully sinning after we havereceived the clear tidings of the truth, there no longerremains to us a sacrifice for sin.There only awaits us aterrible judgment and sentence of fire, which will burn andBecause, if any one broke theconsume the adversaries.”1 Heb. vi.48THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMELaw of Moses, and it was proved by two or threewitnesses, he irrevocably died; how much greater punishment would he deserve who should despise the Son ofGod, not esteeming His blood any more than that of abase animal, by whose blood he had been sanctified, or heshould offer so great an affront to the Spirit of gracewhich he had received? And these first words, “wilfullysinning,” have great emphasis and mystery.The same does St. John say in his first epistle, andSt. Peter in his second one,” and these are the two placesof which the same prince of the apostles declares that theyhave been debased by the ignorant, who, to their ownperdition, comprehend or interpret them in a false sense;not only this, but even the rest of the holy Scriptures, aswas the case with the miserable Novatus, who denied theremedy of the sacrament of penance to the faithful. Andforasmuch as I do not exercise here the office of exponent,but that of an historian, I will not digress any longer tooffer further information on these texts, but simply limitmyself to giving the causes why the Gentiles of those daysdelayed baptism.Others there were who, although theydid not carry things so far, nor were blinded by this error,yet put off their baptism from a cowardly idea, lest theyshould offend our Lord after receiving it more grievously;holding the sins committed previous to baptism in lesseraccount than those committed after receiving the sacrament.Forasmuch as after baptism they called themselves not onlysinners from henceforth, but “transgressors,” as St. Paulcalls sinners" who after receiving the law break it, onaccount of the gravity which that state demands by reasonof the ingratitude shown for the benefit received, for thefaith and oath taken which has been broken; and thereforethey judged that by delaying in this way to be baptizedSt. John i. 3.2 St. Peter ii. 2.Rom.BAPTISM IN ROME49to avoid all these things, live with greater liberty and lessscruples, less notice being taken by others of their lives,and moreover, they chose for themselves when andAgainst such basewhere they should be baptized.thoughts as these, such abuses of grace, and mean correspondence with God, very skilfully does St. GregoryNazianzen in an eloquent oration dispute to the purpose,saying as follows: “You may tell me you do not receivebaptism because you fear your bad inclinations, and theevil propensities with which our nature leans to what isevil and pursues vice. A fine excuse covered by cowardice !But listen to a brief solution.Tell me, oh you, who areso afraid of sin, which of the two do you judge lives theholier and more blameless a life—he who does not sin orhe who lives in sin?If you reply—and as is true—thatit is he who does not sin, then why do you fear to receivebaptism, if even before baptism you keep so diligentlywhat the divine law ordains? And if, perchance, your lifebe not pure and innocent, you do not guard against whatmay defile you; if you continue a long time in your evilcourse, and have grown hardened in sinful customs, it isclearly manifest that you await the last hour of life toThisreceive baptism and in that moment depart this life!is a pestilential fraud, not of property, nor of gold, but ofsin, seeking to reap a profit by the same fraud, by whichyou pretend to sanctify and purify the soul.” And at theend of the discourse he adds: “He who receives thepurifying cleansing bath of this regeneration is like to anew soldier who has as yet performed no brave deed, butwho sits down beneath the standard having been in noencounter, nor broken into any skirmish, nor having evenconfronted the enemy.Neither by merely clothing himself in the uniform of a soldier, and being clad in coat ofmail and armed with a sword, will he be held valiant andE.5oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEbrave, nor could he have the right to approach to speakwith the captain, as though he were an experienced soldier,who had been already proved, nor would he dare to askfavour or concessions like those who have gone throughregular engagements.In the same way you who arebut recently baptized, how can you think that you willenter with the saints into a participation of the crownsand the recompense of their victories until you shouldhave by the faith you profess first fought and braved allmanner of affronts and dangers, having resisted with braveheart and courageous will the encounters of the flesh andthe combats of the devil?”The divine Chrysostom, treating this same subject withthe eloquence of his golden mouth, among other reasonshe advances, says as follows: “You fear to approachbaptism I Did you in truth fear this holy sacrament youwould receive it and lovingly cherish it. Yet for thatreason you will at once add, ‘I do not receive it becauseI do not fear it.But tell me do you not fear to die inthis state.’ ‘God is most merciful, you will say, ‘andwould not permit such a thing.Very well, then, go andreceive baptism if you find that God is so humane andThatmerciful. What a strange being you must bewhich you should hasten to attend to, viz., to receivebaptism, you put off, casting in oblivion the mercy of God,and you only bear in mind the dread it causes you; yet,when desirous of delaying baptism you resort to thismercy!You follow a reverse way in everything; because he that is not baptized knows not how great is themercy of God; whilst he that by receiving baptism placeshimself in His hands, and for love of Him has renounced allthings, although he may again fall into sin, nevertheless,provided he truly repents, at once experiences in himselfthe divine mercy. Whosoever desires to go further intoBAPTISM IN ROME51the matter and find the reasons urged and added here bythe said saint, may read what he says, because for mypurpose I have merely sought to discover the variousmotives why in those times baptism was deferred byvarious classes; because in this present happy age of theChurch, when all truths have been so deeply investigated,and those first usages put away, I deem them of smallneed. The most wholesome and safe course has beennow well established, which is, that children should bebaptized without awaiting a more mature age, both for thereason put forward by St. Dionysius Areopagite, at theend of his Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, wherein he teachesthat children from their tenderest age should be investedwith the sacraments, in order that from their earliest yearsChrist should converse with them.In this way afford noopportunity for any other life to be imprinted on them butthe divine life, and ever contemplate it; as well as becausewithout doubt the devil then is possessed of lesser powers,and does not take possession of their bodies and souls, asBecause, ashe does in such as have not that divine life.by original sin they are his captives, he deals with themwith greater liberty; as has been explained by the angelicdoctor, and as by experience we are taught what illusionsand mockings evil spirits will work where they find smallfrequentation of the sacraments, and how far exiled theyare from the places where the sacraments are dispensed andvenerated.Hence, our saint came forth, a youth out of thebaptismal font, newly born in Christ, divested of the skinof the ancient serpent, and, as he himself says, vested withChrist and Christ vested in him, made a living memberof Him, no longer of earthly nature but of the celestialIfone, regenerated by water and the Holy Ghost.St. Thom. 4. d. q. 5, art. I.52THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEany one wishes to read, in a brief manner, the glories ofbaptism in choice language let him peruse the Epistlewhich the great Father" wrote to his friend Oceanus, andhis desire will be fulfilled.Ad Oceanum, cap. 3.DISCOURSE THE FOURTHOn the Purity and the Virginity which St. Jerome preservedduring his LifeMANY as have been the men of learning and of renownwho up to the present time have treated or written concerning this glorious Father, as well as popular traditionand the accepted opinion of pious persons, all haveaffirmed that St. Jerome was a true virgin, because by allauthorities has his life been held to have been so strictand so modest of habit that they do not hesitate to declarethat he guarded perfect purity and that the white stoleand the spotless robe wherein he was vested when heentered the militia of Christ were never stained.When the High Priest entered to offer sacrifice beforethe Lord in the city of Israel, among other ornaments andapparel with which he was vested was that of a tunic ofwhitest linen, woven in such a way that there were distributed many small eyes in the manner of table linen, whichat the present day we call damask or embroidery. Godwished by this apparel to demonstrate that he who shouldbe called to the priesthood and be master of his people(since this was the principal office—that of declaring thelaw, as He says by the mouth of a prophet) must lead alife of great innocence and purity, and that in order toguard this virtue he must not sleep, but must remain withIf Godhis eyes wide open, and these to be a thousand.5354THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEsets such account of the integrity of the symbol, whatshall we say of the reality of the thing signified ? And,when God created Jerome to be so great a doctor andpriest of His Church, who will dare to say He did notvest him with this Ephod (for so this tunic is called in theoriginal language)?And the retirement and the fearswhich are seen throughout the life of this Father, whenhe fears even the very smallest thoughts and can findno assurance, who does not perceive that these are theNevertheless, albeiteyelets of this pure white garment?that this is the case, the persecutors of virtue will notallow the bones of the saints to rest in peace. There areauthors who, founding their opinion, although deceitfullyand evilly, state that our saint lost his virginal purity, onthe words which I shall quote in truth and to the letter.In the first of all his Epistles, writing to Heliodorus, hesays as follows: “Consider, my brother, that it is notlawful to hold or possess anything of your property.” Hewho does not renounce (says the Lord) all that he possesseth,“Tell me, why are you a Christiancannot be my disciple.with so timid a heart?Consider how Peter leaves hisnet; consider how Matthew rises up from his table atthe exchange and becomes an apostle; the Son of Manhas nowhere to rest His head, yet you are tracing outand measuring wide gates and luxurious apartments.Ifyou place your hopes on the things of the world you willExplain the name of monk, forfail to be heir with Christ.by this are you called. What will you do amid the multitude and the bustle bearing the name of solitary?I donot give you this advice as one who has not tested thedangers of the waves, or one who escaped with the shipor the merchandise safely to the shore; but as a skilledmariner, who, having now come out of the shipwreck onto the sands, with fearful voice, warns those who newlyPURITY OF LIFE55attempt the sea.There, indeed, is sucked in and drawnto the fire of the luxurious Charybdis the salvation of thesoul; here the deceitful Scylla, with the face of a youngdamsel, flattering with false laughter, in order to wreckchastity.Here is the sea-shore of a barbarian peoplebereft of reason; here the Corsair devil with his alliesbinds with strong chains those whom he captures. Donot act lightly: do not be trustful; do not judge yourselfsecure, although the sea should appear to be calm andinvite you, and the wind scarcely moves the hair of yourhead.Be it known to you that in this plain there arehigh mountains, and within is a great peril concealed;within is the enemy in ambush; tighten the cords, spreadout the sails, place the mark of the Cross on your foreheads; this is a tempest rather than a calm.”This isthe first quotation, and one of the testimonies which maybe brought against the saint in order to affirm that in hisyouth he had lost his virginal purity |Here we have thepicture of a routed individual, his merchandise lost, theapparel cast to the sea thrown up by the waves, engulfedby Scylla, swallowed up by Charybdis, flung on the sands,and as much else as may be desired. Had he not discovered to us in the Epistle which follows directly afterthis one, which is addressed to Nepotian, what theeloquent orator means, we ourselves should remain fearingthis tempest; but in the first instance he there confessesin this Epistle that he wished to test his genius and playwith many metaphorical and rhetorical colours.Andeven should he not have made this statement, any one—unless he were very blind or very malicious—would atonce perceive this, because in this is easily revealed hissoul and intent.Here he acts the part of one, who isexperienced and the master; his aim is to persuade hisfriend to love the life of solitude. He places before him56THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe dangers of the world, and beneath the metaphor withits most elegant allegory he describes the variety of sins,warning him of the common danger—waves, winds, quicksands, shoals, false and fair winds, deceitful prosperities,vain favours, despair, sadness, persecutions; on the otherpart Scylla, Charybdis, pirates, bad ports, encounters,captivities, prisons, vices of the flesh, sensuality, pride,evil intentions, wretched aims, the sad effects of all thesemiseries ! Let us, then, say with these grave censors thatof all this is Jerome full; so many evils were admittedin so good a soul, because he does not bewail one thingmore than the other.The skilful mariner—as he here depicts him to us, whofrom such grave dangers was able safely to land onthe shore—was not swallowed up by Charybdis, nor washe deceived by Scylla; he was not captured by pirates, nordid he sink in the shoals. He fought with all; he wasattacked; he was beseiged, persecuted; but his dexterity,his spirit, and bravery carried him through, despite the illtreatment he was subjected to, and brought him alive to land,for so is it necessary that those should be tried, who haveto be masters of all. And let this passage serve us tounderstand in all we may say farther on on this subject,because without blemish he endured in patience all thesetrials; he was in the extreme the warrior saint. Godpermitting him to be tried—tried in all things—becausehe that has to be so masterly a general must need beexperienced; and, as the Apostle" says of our only HighPriest and Preceptor, tempted “like to us in all things, butNot in such a high degree certainly, butwithout sin.”according to his measure, in His way, as far as can be ina fragile vase which contains so precious a treasure; andthe fact of having no evidence of the victory renders us1 Hebrews vi.PURITY OF LIFE57uncertain of what passes in secret, God concealing Hisfavours for a greater good, as we shall see farther on, inorder that souls should not be elated with the victories,and forasmuch as this manner of life is more secure, beinghidden in Christ. We have no further intention of commenting in this place, because even the one who mostfeels on this subject' could not find in this passage anoccasion to exhibit his malice.Let us then proceed tomore clear statements. When commending to his twofriends, Chromatius and Eusebius, the care of his sister,he says: “I may well state that my sister is as a new fruitproduced in Christ by the skill of our saintly Julian; heplanted it, do you both cultivate it, for God will give theincrease.This fruit has been given me (as though a newthing) by Jesus Christ, after the enemy had wounded hersoul so badly, by bringing her from death to life, for whichreason “I am fearful of even what is most secure' (as thepoet says). You are well aware, my friends, how slipperyand prone is the state of youth for falls; in it I fell, andyou yourselves did not pass that period without greatfears; she commences to enter it, and so she has great needof being assisted by many counsels, admonished by manywarnings, and needs sustaining by much comforting: Imean to ask that with your saintly letters you give herfrequently advice and inspire her with courage.And,whereas charity suffersthings, I pray you veryearnestly to induce Bishop Valerian also to write to herto this purpose, and encourage her, since you are wellaware how greatly the minds of young women arerestrained and encouraged when they perceive thatpersons of such distinction are watchful for them.”allThis, indeed, is a very powerful confession of St.hisJerome's, since he clearly statesinthat he fellEpist. 43.1 Erasmus.58THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEyouth, and for the purpose of what he says he declaresthe condition of his fall!I do not know how they canfall into this error, unless from being so experienced; theseNow, I ask, from whatauthors are capable of anything.do they infer that, when a saint says, “I also am weak andmiserable, and have had many falls, and often fell whena young man,”—that, for that reason, he states that helost his virginity?Most certainly, if we follow such arigid argument, we shall declare that there is not a singlevirgin left, because which of the saints will say that he didnot fall?Since they judged all things to be of mortaldanger, who is there that does not perceive this? Andhow many manners of falling may not be found in thatstate? Of the just, the sacred Scriptures tell us, he fallsseven times each day, yet with all these many falls hedoes not lose the name of just; but here they require thatJerome after one fall should lose that inestimable jewellBy this line of reasoning they might also condemn theApostle of the Gentiles, who, after having been a “vesselof election,” and having carried through the world thatprecious name of salvation, was made a captive in thebands of concupiscence, because he says that the laws ofthe nobler part of the soul are made captive to the lawsof sin.If the humble and consoling words of the saintsare to be received and understood in so crude a point, weshall have no saint left, and this seems to be the aim ofthose who so read them.Let us hear what St. Basildeclares in a book he wrote on True Virginity, where hesays what we have already declared as regards these men,that they would wish to minimise in the saints this virtueof purity“Let no one think,” he says, “that, if the bodybe that of a virgin it follows that the soul is that of a virginlikewise; it may be that the body is pure, yet interiorly the1 Basil, De Vera Virginit.PURITY OF LIFE59soul may not be so. A bold, unguarded look puts the soul onits guard against what was not seen by pure eyes. Wordswhispered tenderly in the ear to touch the heart corruptFrom this is at once inferred—if in theand deflower it.soul purity is lost, what reason have we to declare thatthe body still retains that virtue P”I do suspect thatfrom these words of the saint occasion has been taken forsaying that sentence commonly ascribed to St. Basil: “Inever knew woman, yet I do not thereby judge myself tobe a virgin.”In the same manner does our doctor express himselfwhen writing to the virgin Eustochium: “If those who areemaciated, shut up in the deserts, endure so many battlesof the flesh solely with their thoughts, what shall we sayof the battles which a young damsel is exposed to, whois placed in such luxury?”Let us, according to thisreasoning, reckon this saint among the dead, for, according to the unappealable sentence of these rigid censors ofvirginity, she is lost !In order that this be better understood, I should liketo ask those, who so darkly interpret the language of thesaints, were we to lay hold of one of those, who so earnestlyare striving to be servants of God, such as Jerome, andendeavouring with all the strength of their souls to lovesome signal virtue, praise him as being well exercised andexcelling in it, or let him imagine that we knew heprided himself on possessing such a virtue, what wouldthe saint say in that case? Would he take pride in this?Would he take occasion to glorify himself in this virtue,although he might be distinguished for it? Most certainlyhe would not; rather, with troubled countenance and eyescast down, he would excuse himself with the best reasoninghe could find in order not to speak falsehood to men orshow himself ungrateful to God. Thus did Jerome act,6oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwho, being the learned man he was, came out of thisdifficulty in a humble, honourable manner. “I have not,”he said, “that which you deem I so greatly extol, becauseI see myself so experienced in it; rather do I marvel whenI see those who possess it.But let no one be deceivedwith flattery and praises, because there are two virginities,which follow two births, the one of the flesh, and the otherof the spirit; and whereas the one fights against the other,we oftentimes see ourselves cast down by the law of theflesh, doing what we do not wish to do.” Which is equalto saying more clearly: Although, in the body, I am avirgin, yet in the spirit I do not know whether I ambecause I know not how I come out of those combats, andof the encounters which the flesh makes against the spirit;and I marvel greatly at those who have this virginity, forthey are like pure white doves who soar aloft aboveThisthis earth, whilst I see myself attached to it.appears to me to be the secret and native meaning ofthis quotation.Because, when I behold how carefully thesaints view their defects, how they withdraw from themselves the consideration of their virtues, and how readilythey accuse themselves of the smallest defect, I am inclinedto believe of them the contrary of what their words wouldseem to convey; and in some manner God is desirous thatthey be revealed and made manifest, as is seen by this text,which, if it be not understood in this manner, would haveno meaning. The saints esteem being humble more thanbeing virgins, because virginity may be found togetherwith pride, but not humility; for having humility, all elseHence this perfectly agrees with thatremains secure.sentence of St. Bernard, who affirms that God was morewon by the humility of His holy mother than by hervirginity.1 Bern.

Yetneither the one nor the other lied, because on the occasionswhen they said this they considered what they were inthemselves and of themselves, and whereas they foundnought but poverty, without looking upon what they heldfrom God, judging it to belong to another master, theyhesitate not to cast themselves down and attribute to themselves all the evils, which may be expected from so corrupta principle. They consider, on the contrary, the good inothers, what benefits they received from God, and prostrate on the ground acknowledge those gifts, and in thesense and rule in which they walk, without duplicity orhypocrisy, they humble themselves down to the mostabject ones of the earth, holding themselves to be evenworse than they are, not as regards outward deeds, but inthat fear of being ungrateful for the benefits received andfor that which they clearly see on their part is strugglingFrom whence we may well affirm that, into come out!spite of what St. Jerome may say that he was not a virgineither in body or in soul (and it is easier to affirm the firstthan the second), we are not bound to believe him eitherin regard to the first or to the second, because we havealready seen the way in which the humble speak; and themore so when we remember how God does not allow themto keep silent for long, affording them occasions to reveal62THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe truth, as was witnessed in St. Paul and in the Baptist,who confessed by word and by deed what to all appearances they had denied, and the same thing also happenedto our saint, as we shall see farther on.St. Augustine declares a grave thing when, speaking tothis purpose, he says: “I dare to affirm that to theproud virgin it is no small benefit to fall from that purity,in order that with the fall he may humble himself in thatwhich he was proud of.”And in his books De CivitateDei he affirms, that, if the Lord permitted the virgins ofRome to be corrupted by the barbarian Goths, it was inorder to humble them in their haughtiness, or from thatwhich should spring from it, should they respect it as aVirginity is a high and sovereign virtue,sacred thing.which lifts up a man to a state, which is more thanhuman, and therefore it is necessary to conceal it withtimidity, in order that there should not happen to themwhat occurred to the sons of Israelin Egypt, whenPharaoh, on becoming aware that a male child was born,In the same way doesordered that it should be slain.the tyrannical evil spirit act in ourselves, for with pridehe seeks to destroy the manly virtues, which spring up inThis is taughtour souls. The remedy is to hide them.us by Jerome as by one who, knowing the figure well,conceals his virginity, and without falsehood denies thebirth of the Israelite within his house.Because, as thereis no greater war made than that which sensuality wagesagainst virgins, the saint is full of fear lest, without beingaware of it, death may have taken place within his owndoors. “The enemy,” says the angelic Doctor on theMaster of the sentences,” “awakens in the flesh of virginsa natural curiosity with ardent desires to experience what1 Aug.

JEROMEwith our heavenly Queen in the privilege of virginity, thatvirtue, which in me has perished, now there is not evenbreath left to reattain it;I impoverished myself on mydung-heap; I am made like a beast.”togivenan extreme degreeIn this way we might quote something of every one ofthe saints, yet with regard to many their virginity wasnever placed in doubt, nor are their words to be taken inthe literal sense as having lost it. And the reason whythis has been commented upon in our saint is, becausethose, who found fault and criticised his epistles and books,found those self-humiliations which are to be found in allthe saints' witness, and so they corrupted the meaning ofhis saintly words. And this reason works in me so firmlythat it urges me to hold as evidence the very contrary towhat they feel themselves; forasmuch as St. Jerome isinhumility, and toattribute faults to himself and to deny what is good inhimself or to conceal it, disguise and minimise it—and,what is more, to call the defects of others his own.When relating in an Epistle to Julian how Heliodorushad quitted the desert, whose solitude both had embraced,Jerome, not wishing to subject his friend to any reproachof levity, blames himself for the fault, saying: “Herelived the holy brother Heliodorus who, wishing to residealong with me in the desert, has at last departed, drivenaway by my evil doings.”If this is to be understood as itis expressed, when it was altogether different, what canwe say of this glorious Father? And whereas it is clearlyseen that in the sense of these words he is speaking inmodesty as well as what in another part he says, whendescribing the cause of this departure, it is evident thatwe must do the same in our statement, and that if hesays he praises that virginity which he has not, it proceedsfrom the same root, for he subsequently reveals thePURITY OF LIFE65contrary.Let us, therefore, hear him when he speakstruthfully of himself, and what he feels when he deems hespeaks in security. When writing to the holy virgin Eustochium, to whom, as to a most pure dove, he manifestedhis secrets, for in truth she was worthy of such honour andprivilege by reason of her sanctity and prudence, heexpresses himself in this manner: “Not only do wepraise virginity and extol it, but we likewise observe itin our daily lives, because it does not suffice to know whatis good, unless we guard with care that which we hold assuch, for that appertains to the understanding and this tothe deed and the work; the first is common and known bymany, the second is for the few; he that perseveres tothe end will be saved; for many are called, but feware chosen l”Undoubtedly this passage proves moreclearly that St. Jerome was a virgin than the othersSt.that he was not.Jerome says he was not a virgin, and again statesthat he was a virgin: if he was not a virgin and yetsays that he was, it is an untruth and pride; whilst, ifhe was a virgin and denies it, this would be humility andChristian modesty—hence we must admit the affirmation ofthe latter and not the former. They would reply that thepassage can be explained away and means something else.And let me ask, Have the other passages no explanation?Very well, then, let us come to the explanation, and let thefirst remark be on the first objection,” from which explanation we might very well urge that the Apostle St. James saidin his Epistle,” “Behold how small a fire what a great woodit kindleth P And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity.”And, in truth, such appears to be some of the explanationsof this censor. He manifests it in this passage in which,This reason is a powerful one.1 Epist. 22.pErasmus in Vita divi Hieronymi.St. James iii. 5, 6.56THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEscorning all others, he paraphrases inthis manner:*“Not only do we praise Virginity but we even keep it,which means that we, moreover, teach it, and we give rulesThis provesas to how that virtue should be guarded.”his intention: in the first place, because he states that it isa phrase very well known and elegant in the Latin tongue,and well expresses what we say that we keep well thatSecondly, because thewhich we give rules for guarding.title of the letter expresses it, which is De Virginitateservanda, that is to say, a letter which teaches how topreserve virginity; and lastly, because the coherence andthe thread of the letter consists in publishing it, and itcannot be understood otherwise.Let us, therefore, attack this exponent with thisLet us see, in conformity with hislast reason itself.exposition, how the text runs, and what connection itNot only do we praise (says the text) virginity,carries.but we even give rules in order to guard it.Followingthis exposition, let us add the rest, and we shall see howit fits in, or rather how it destroys the text; because itdoes not suffice to know what is good, unless with greatcare we guard what is held as such. To which must beadded the exposition, “unless it is guarded in others,”whence the absurdity is made patent, furthermore, by whatdirectly follows; the former touches the understanding,and the latter the deed and the work; the first is commonand is known to many, the second to the few; he only,Oh, thou newwho perseveres to the end, will be saved.exponent, let me ask you, Which is it that touches theunderstanding? The giving of rules to preserve virginity,and how to treat and know the virtue, you will doubtlesssay. Then it is to deeds and to labour that appertainsthe preservation of the virtue, the former thing being of1 Erasmus in Vita divi Hieron, ect. in antidote hujus Epist. 22.PURITY OF LIFE67many, the latter for the few; and few are chosen for solofty a virtue. Do you now perceive clearly the coherenceand the reasoning, similarly to the word of St. Jerome, whopreserves virginity, and not only extols it, which does notmean, nor can it mean, that he gives rules and teacheshow to keep them, and in this way he keeps what is inothers? Do you see how greatly you are worthy of pityand of derision?But let us come to your statement.When did you find in St. Jerome, or in any other author,It might wellwho knew Latin, such a manner of speech?be said of Seneca, and of Aristotle, and of other notedphilosophers, who disputed on all the virtues, that, becausethey gave admirable rules for acquiring them, they practised those virtues? You are so desirous of deprivingthe saints of their virtues that, in order to do so, youcounterfeit new phrases in the Latin tongue? The titleof the Epistle is the Guarding of Virginity, and not itspraises, for this was the new road which the saint chose,different from that taken by Tertullian, Ambrose, andDamasus; hence what he teaches is truth; but the ruleshe gives he has taken from experience, from his ownlabour,circumspection, from hisperseverance in combating; for all this regards the few,and thus he states, for example, in many of his epistles:“And he can do so without arrogance, because he isspeaking as to a loved daughter, and he tempers it insuch sort that he rather attempts to manifest his ownweakness than to demonstrate his virtues.”This is thefirst exposition |continualfromhisNow let us take the second, and let us leave thecourt of critics to finish arguing this dispute on behalfof our saint against the author, who, witnessing how farhe goes from reason, says to him as follows: “What do1 Marianus in Vita divi Hieronymi.68THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEWhat do you suppose?What are youyou seek?inquiring aboutFor how can it be declared in clearerterms or by a more manifest testimony that St. Jeromewas a virgin than by the words which he himself speaks?”Whereas others saw that this did not agree, and thatthe coherence and the letter and what was so lauded andrepeated made the explanation of no value, they attemptedto explain the distinction between the first virginity andthe second, of the first birth and the second one, as we havestated above. They say that he declares in the formerpassages the loss of the first virginity, and the virginityof the second birth is what he clearly states he did notonly praise but that he also keeps; because it matters littleto know the good, if it is not held and possessed. This is asubtle and skilled distinction for those, who do not see howout of purpose they are to treat the subject, and for thosewho are not aware that men so learned as Jerome, whenthey purpose to treat on a subject, do not transform oruse equivocation in their words in a puerile manner, usingthe signification in a different way. The saintly doctorproceeds to treat learnedly, and with all propriety, thesubject of virginity, which the Church and the saints andthe entire world celebrates and lauds in pure and holymaidens, and was he to pass on without any purpose totreat in its severest point of the chastity of souls afterbaptism, which is a virtue that is found in souls after thatsacrament even in such as were not chaste before receivingit?Moreover, it is a style of language, which is quiteunusual, because who styles St. Augustine and St. Cyprian,or any of the saints, who had children before being baptized, virgins, because after their baptism they were mostpure and saintly? Nor when indeed did any of them dareNo doubtto attribute to themselves so great a titlesuch as say this do not advert that, strictly speaking, asPURITY OF LIFE69the dialecticians say, this word virgin and virginity in itsforce and value sounds as a purpose of not severing thatcorporal seal guarding in its purity body and soul; andin this sense does the saintly doctor proceed to write hisEpistle, like one who well knows what it is to speak withpropriety and metaphor: “Because the chastity of the souland cleanness of heart is a general virtue, whose foundation and root is laid in charity and all the other theologicalvirtues, which form the espousals of the soul and God; butthat virtue, which directly looks to the things in whichconcupiscence becomes unbridled, in order to correct andhold them, this is properly styled chastity; to which, onadding a most firm purpose of abstaining perpetually fromall sensible delectations, which are the matter of this form,there is induced a particular and, as it were, an angelicvirtue, which is called virginity.”This veil is so delicatethat the saints always treat on it with great circumspection,and there are few, who dare to boast of its beauty, so muchso that St. Augustine says that the instant the thread ofthis perpetual purpose of guarding integrity is severed,this virtue becomes lost. And other doctors and saintsso subtilly treat of this that they dare to affirm in theirtheology” thattheirlanguage), which is given in heaven to virgins, is notenjoyed, nor is it attained (even with a firm purpose),unless confirmed by vow.From this proceed the fearsof the saints, and their circumspection; and from thislikewise the thought of our saint to deny the possessionof such a treasure.this crownaureole(calledinBut, in all truth, I do not see how before his baptismJerome could have lost this virtue, as our adversaries byBecause whoever examines thecommon consent assert.1 Aug. in lib.

JEROMElife the saintly youth led at that time in Rome—his greatstudies, his naturally holy inclinations, his tender age, hisdevotion in visiting the sepulchres and the cemeteries,wherein were laid the martyrs, his noble companions, holyand devout—how can it be imagined that he sustained sucha fall, or what could have occasioned it? Who is not awarethat, ere such a fall takes place, it is preceded long beforeby many failings and stumblings, induced by slothfulness,by evil company, and by sinful inclinations, and neversuddenly ?Hence we have fully investigated (whether our adversaries be convinced or not) that both before and afterbeing baptized Jerome was most chaste and pure, andthat to say the contrary is a statement sprung from heartsof men of small minds, and who do not view or judge thequestion in a right manner.BOOK T H E SECON DTHIRD AGE–ADOLESCENCEPROEMWE have briefly considered in the First Book the relationof the first and second periods of the life of St. Jerome—his infancy and boyhood—as far as we have been able togather from his own writings. We now come to the thirdperiod or age, which is called adolescence.This age orperiod, which, according to the general opinion, works aperfect revolution during its course, begins at about thefifteenth year and extends to the twenty-first or twentysecond year of a man's life, when the full growth of thebody is attained and his stature is set. Nature proceeds sorapidly during this period, and is so busy with that part ofthe soul, which philosophers call vegetative, with the objectof concluding her work, that all that there is in man, andmore especially what appertains to the part of reason, isentirely in a state of unquiet, and calculated to imperfectlyexercise its office, and, as a consequence, not so free forundertaking things of purpose, yet ready for all that isamusing and inclined for the things of concupiscence.Our saint commenced this third period of life in hisfifteenth year, a number a thousand times sacred andholy in the Sacred Scriptures, as being one which enclosedin itself the mystery of the two Testaments, the Newand the Old. Thus does St. Augustine teach us whenhe says, speaking of thePsalms, “The number ofour years are seventy, in those that are strong, eighty,”7374THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwhere it says: “Seventy and eighty make a hundredand fifty,” and inthis number a holy thing is manifested, because the Book of the Psalms is composedIf seven and eight be added theyof this number.make fifteen.Seven declares the Old Testament, andeight the New ; the first on account of the observance ofthe seventh day, which was the Sabbath, and the latter,by reason of the eighth, which is the eternal rest ofthe Sunday, figured for all, and as though in its propercause in the Resurrection of our Saviour Jesus Christ.Likewise, because the number of seven is a number, inwhich is revolved the whole course of life, and of thetemporal things, which were promised the earthly men ofthe Old Testament; and the figure eight is, as it were,an already commenced possession of the land of the livingin the person of the divine men of the New Testament,and of the law of grace.”This is told us by St. Augustine along with otherthings in respect to the number fifteen.The illustration of this was brought to its loftiestpoint by our saintly doctor.Comprehending its mystery,enclosed in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians,he teaches us that those fifteen days, during which St. Paulcommunicated with St. Peter in Jerusalem, symbolise aplenitude of science and a singular perfection of doctrine,because in the Psalter there are fifteen psalms, which arelike fifteen steps, by which the just man ascends until heattains to stand up and appear in the presence of theDivine Majesty and enter into the courts of the HouseIt was upof the Lord, singing with a joyful voice.this mystic number of steps that the King Ezechiasmounted to receive the prodigious sign of an increase oflife for fifteen years, returning, or like to the sun turningback from the gates of death. The most solemn feasts ofPROEM75the Lord God of Israel commenced on the fifteenth day ofthe moon.This, says St. Jerome, was the numberof years he had attained when he entered the third periodor age, that of adolescence, a great sign of the plenitude of science he would attain.Because, when in theprevious age, that of puberty, Jerome studied as we haveseen human letters, and in them had become so proficient, now in the present age he lifts his soul to higherthings, and having still to soar in his flight, which is noless than to enter into the knowledge of that sacred science,which is enclosed in the two Testaments, it becomes, as itwere, necessary that he should cast all the blandishmentsof that period into the waters of the Deluge, mysticallyrepresented by the fifteen fathoms deep which rose abovethe highest parts of the earth. And that commencing tosing a new canticle he should rise step by step, followingthe fifteen stages of the courts of the Temple of Onegreater than Solomon until he should enter into theknowledge of that perfect wisdom, which leads to eternalsalvation, prolonging it by the number of fifteen years, inorder to enclose in itself not only what is measured bythe temporal seven, but even what is comprehended bythe eight of eternal duration.To my mind this illustration fits the soul of our saint,and is well founded coming from the school of Pythagoras;for, wishing to afford us a knowledge of the composition,being, parts, and offices of the soul, they symbolised it byfigures and numbers. They set a triangle of equal parts,and at the one point or angle of the triangle they placedthe first cipher, that of one; along the sides they placedeven numbers on one side, and odd numbers on the other;on the one side beneath the number 1 they put 2, under2 they put 4, and at the base 8, and on the other side theThese even numbers added together makeodd numbers.76THE LIFE OF ST. JEROME14, with the one at top 15; and in thus doing they seemedto think they revealed to us the rank, office, virtue,strength, and power of the soul. The soul is representedby the triangle with its three powers, defined by its threeequal sides, or its three virtues or grades, viz. vital, animal,and rational; and in this third period or age, that ofadolescence, the soul commences to manifest the fulnessof its grades, performing works guided by the reason, andhaving the faculty of making use of those actions, whichtheologians and moral philosophers define as deliberate,and proper to manhood, springing from the power of thefree will.That which unites at the top is indicative ofwhat is superior to the Spirit as something which standsin a higher position than itself, contained in the highestsimplicity, free of division or plurality, in one simpleBeing.Metaphysicians generally declare that all that webehold distributed, and, as it were, spread out amid theinferior things of virtue or perfection—all becomes joinedtogether and made into One by superior virtue, withoutdivision, as far as its grades will allow, ascending from oneto the other until united, merged without any manner ofdivision or composition into the most simple nature of God!This is that most perfect union which above itself the soulcontemplates; all else descends with some division, andis lower than the soul, and becomes multiplied.This iswhat is signified by the even numbers being placed alongthe sides of the triangle, such as are 2, 4, 8, which makeup the sum of 14 of the material things, which are divisible.This is not the place to carry this reason to its completion,going beyond the limits of history; it suffices, therefore,to gather from the great sphere which begins to be revealedto us that which is to our purpose, viz. that our saint, atthe period he is now entering on, has left behind him thetwo other past periods, like to one who gazes down farPROEM77below his feet at worldly things—material, puerile—andraises his eyes and the wings of his thoughts to thateternal unity, to the solid truth which never deceives;and, bidding adieu for ever to the number 14, places thegoal of his desires in that union of 7 and 8, entering theschool of both the Testaments, which is promised him inthe inheritance of Him, who was not satisfied to sign it inthe mystical blood of so many animals—forasmuch as itwas of no effect for such lofty possessions—but who signedit with the blood of His own Son, and such as receivedHim He did not disdain to call His brethren.DISCOURSE THE FIRSTAfter St. Jerome had received the Sacrament of Baptism hedeparted to France, to visit the learned Men there andto prosecute his Studies.He enters a Desert withBonosus.THE holy youth Jerome, vested in his beautiful livery, thesuperior part of his soul, which is called mind, inflamed bya lively faith, a firm hope, an ardent charity; the inferiorpart, which is styled rational, adorned with varied discipline as we have said; the understanding enlightenedand luminous, the will indoctrinated with holy customs,the body drilled from its earliest years to obey the spirit,the tongue exercised in expressing the thoughts conceivedby the heart—he was minded to bend his steps towardsstudies of greater depth, to which his heart was impellinghim with ardent desires. He endeavoured, therefore, inall earnestness to employ his whole self in the study ofthe sacred scriptures, and of that celestial philosophy whichis enclosed in them; for it appeared to him (as he himselfstates in another part) that it was meet that a man whilston earth should study that which is to be continued inHeaven. Our saint reflected in himself that the naturalinclination, which is found in all men for acquiring scienceand knowledge, is never satisfiedin the things herebelow, because inferior to the yearnings of the immortal78STUDIES IN FRANCE79soul, and because also they possessin them betterprinciples and the seeds of more lovely fruits, which urgethem to investigate more precious treasures and secretsthan those which nature hides in herself. He also considered how necessary it was to find a good method forpursuing such studies, in order to go over a long road in ashort time, because in truth the longest life is but short toattain knowledge. He likewise perceived that among thegreat men, whose memories live, and which time is unableto efface, they followed two manners of proceeding. Some,in order to verify with accuracy what they learnt, soughtto see with their own eyes what they had read, and to findthese things, or at least find those who with a livingvoice might instruct them, and for this purpose undertooklong voyages, unwilling to trust solely to books andwritten narratives.Others did not pursue so laborious acourse, but by reading and pondering over strangewritings which they had found, or by exchanging valuabledocuments with other students, contented themselves byelucidating what was more intricate and obscure—thesewere called in ancient times by the Hebrew title ofScribes,the GreekGrammarians, which titles, once so honourable, are nowcast aside by the ignorance of the masses, like the dustunder their feet.These great and noble men leftimperishable memories of their genius, much wealth tofuture ages which have profited by their works, and agood and safe model for others to follow in their path;and, as the poet says, despite the fact that they died andwere laid to rest like other mortals, yet their fame bringsthem back to us in remembrance, and they live, so tospeak, notwithstanding that they are dead.The pathfollowed by the first, and the most difficult (although theVirg. Aen. 6.learned, andLatintheinin8oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEsurest for the purpose) did Jerome deem proper to choose,since it appeared to him—as in truth it was—that communion and intercourse with persons, and the actual,palpable knowledge of things and places, was a livingpower, a certitude, as it were, which those cannot have,who pursue the second road.The power and virtue,which the word carries with it when coming from theteacher, hearing the voice express the individual thoughtas it rises from the heart, is a living commentary, whichis of greater advantage than that which we gather fromthe written page, similarly as the reality differs from thepicture.No one treated on this subject more bravely than didthe doctor himself.Let us hear his own words as theyoccur in the epistle, which he wrote to Paulinus—wordsworthy of being the entrance-gate to the royal palace ofthe sacred scriptures.His words are as follows:–“We read in ancient histories of men who havetraversed provinces, who have visited new countries andpeoples, who have navigated distant seas, solely to gazeon the features of those about whom they have read of inIt would be too long were I to translate thebooks.”Farther on he enumerates the variouswhole quotation.examples, to prove his assertion, of renowned men, suchas Pythagoras, who went from Calabria to Egypt, to thecity of Memphis; Plato, of whom he says that he wentthrough the whole world following the trace of letters, whichhe imagined were slipping away from him. He went awayfrom Athens, where he was universally held to be themaster, to become a disciple in Egypt; from thence hereturned to Italy, in order to study under Archytas ofTarentum, and while on the way fell into the hands of theCorsairs, and although he found himself a captive in thepower of a tyrant as regards the body, yet his soul wasSTUDIES IN FRANCE81free to follow his gift of philosophy. He also bringsforward, as an example, what is recounted of Livy,who, when dwelling in Rome, attracted by the force andfame of his eloquence great numbers of people fromdistant provinces; and those, who would not have beendrawn by reason of the grandeur of Rome, were ledthither by the sole desire to see one great man, and whenentering into so famous a city sought init no otherobject.This is confirmed by Apollonius, who learnedwhile on his long travels that which later on endowedhim with the surname of “Magi” and Philosopher.Our Jerome, placed in the position we have seen, andfinding himself already possessed of a wealth of erudition,judged that it was time he should pass on to higher,studies, and resolved to quit Rome and seek for such 3:masters as would teach him the road to the greatest of theHe determined to pass on to France, andsciences.persuaded his great friend Bonosus to accompany him withthe same object.It is true to say that in Rome therewere men learned in the sacred Scriptures; but, on theother hand, there had come flying rumours of manywise men in Gaul, and furthermore on the way thitherthey could become acquainted with the rhetoricians andgreat orators of the Latin tongue, who flourished in thoselands, and be able to copy the manner of eloquent speech,and imitate that grandeur of oratory, which has ever beencommon to them; and by joining this to the gravity of theRoman style they might form, between these two extremes,a middle diction, which, without offence, should partake ofwhat was good and of advantage in both.Another motive for undertaking this journey was tofrequent the great and famous libraries that were scatteredthroughout the cities of France in those times, where, bytaking notes of the best authors found there, they mightG82THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEenrich themselves by collecting and purchasing goodbooks, for, despite the fact, that the price would be high,since they were all in manuscript, yet Jerome would beable to defray the cost, because, as we have said, he wasthe son of wealthy parents, and who were nothing loth toprovide him with such just needs. The saintly youth wasthus moved to start on his journey; nevertheless, this wasnot the primary motive which had impelled him to goforth, but what I shall proceed to state.At the time Jerome studied in Rome—being veryyoung—the various branches of learning we have spokenabout, the holy Bishop of Pictavium (Poitiers), havingreturned from exile, was during that period engaged inreforming and confirming in the faith throughout Italy andIllyria all the churches, and such as had been infected bythe general heresy of Arius.The holy prelate effected this reform with such diligence,and afforded so great an example of sanctity and such erudition accompanied by native eloquence that he was heldthroughout the provinces as a father general of the faithand pillar of light to the Church.Itis true that Eusebius, the Bishop of Vercelli,greatly assisted St. Hilary in this undertaking; but allsuch writers as have written of this subject—amongthem Sozomen, Socrates,Rufinus,” Nicephorus," andothers—unanimously accord the palm to the holy prelate ofPoitiers, and speak of him in this affair as though he stoodalone.The whole of Italy was full of his fame, and in everyplace men commented on his work, his solid faith, hisgreat learning and eloquence; and in Rome, as a consequence, all this was not concealed but made known, andSozomen, lib. 5, c. 12.Rufin. lib. 1, c. 30, 31Socrat. lib. 3, c. 8.Nizeph. lib. 10, c. 17.STUDIES IN FRANCE83therefore Jerome must have had considerable tidings ofhis doings.It was, moreover, a subject of general comment inthis city at that time how greatly Belles-Lettres flourishedin France, and that questions of faith were defined in amasterly manner, and that there were many books andwritings which as yet had not been published. And for onewho, like our saintly youth, had such high purposes andaspirations, to undertake these studies in an earnestmanner it is clearly manifest that the knowledge of thesefacts acted as a vivid stimulus to undertake with joy andzest this great journey, judging it to be one of importanceand interest.This resolution he carried out, and thuscommenced to follow the path of those above-mentionedmen who studied more wisely by seeing and by travel.It is by conjecture, as there is no further light to guideus, that we believe Jerome to have been in his seventeenthor eighteenth year, although some hold that he must havebeen twenty or twenty-one,—for he himself says that beinga young man he went to France, to that part of Brittanycalled Scotia, where he found the inhabitants of theprovince souncivilised that they eat human flesh.I doubt whether he made the acquaintance of the holyBishop Hilary. Some hold it as certain that he did, andthat he remained with him a few days, in accordance withthose words which he wrote, Ad Magnum Oratorem, wherehe calls Hilary the Confessor of his time.According to what our saint states in his Chronicles,Hilary died in the year 372 of our Holy Redeemer, or,according to Honophrius in 378, in the fifth year of the reignsof Valentinian and Valens, while the Roman Breviary putsit down as the year 373. On his return from the war ofthe heretics and the reformation he effected in Italy heproceeded to reside quietly in his bishopric for six years,84THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEaccording as the authors who lived nearest his time assert,and along with them Sulpicius.Hence, according to ourreckoning with respect to the age of Jerome, he must havebeen at least twenty-three years old, when Hilary died.The very fact that in none of his epistles does he himselfmention having spoken to or communicated with Hilary,despite that with his usual humility he loved to call himselfhis disciple, strengthens me in the belief that he neithersaw him nor conversed with him.The first place these two good students Jerome andBonosus dwelt in, when they came to France, appears tohave been on the banks of the Rhine (Rhenus); this hegives us to understand when writing to Rufinus. Nowas there existed many cities along the banks of this greatriver it is not possible to say in which of them the twoyouths took up their abode, unless we state that it was inthe city which took its name from the river, similarly asthose who live in Alcalá, we say, reside in the town ofHenares, and so on; and therefore we will say he lived inthe city so-called of the Rhine.Before it flows into the ocean this great river dividesinto different branches, and after separating France fromGermany spreads out, according to Cornelius Tacitus, intotwo, and according to Pliny and Ptolemy (which seems tobe truer) into three arms—one arm being called Hebus, theother Helius, the third remaining with the name of Rhine,which last named being the largest of the three streams,the name of that town was called the city of the Rhine;and to this place did these saintly companions withdrawfor some time, because he says that these half-barbariantribes, who inhabited the banks of the Rhine, afforded themdwelling and support.Their abode here must have greatly pleased them,Epist. 41.STUDIES IN FRANCE85because it was far removed from such human communications as could disturb them from their holy thoughts, anddistract them from the meditation of the sacred Scriptures,—as also because the river was to them a singular motive for,and a living lesson of that which with such earnestnessthey aspired to, which was to acquire purity of soul.This they judged to find in the path of meditation andpenance, and for both these things the river suited them;and its border people, although barbarians, served themfor book and masters, for to him who yearns to advance inthe path of virtue all things are of profit, all things speakto him and respond, and from all circumstances he knowshow to draw precious interest.Some grave authors, such as Aristotle, Galen, Virgil,and St. Gregory Nazianzen state that the dwellers onthe banks of the Rhine had the custom of taking newlyborn babes to the river to be washed in its cold waters, inorder to work two effects; viz. to make them healthy, andalso to strengthen and brace up the body for future hardlabour.Galen, learned doctor that he was, and brought upin the luxury of Asia, greatly ridicules so barbarous acustom, and says it is madness to act in this manner.These barbarians think that new-born infants are like thered-hot iron taken from the forge, which becomes temperedand hardened by being immersed in cold water, and thatsimilarly would infants be strengthened by immersion inThis custom is referred to likewise bycold water.Aristotle, who covertly approves of it.Julius Caesar,also, declares this fact, as well as Virgil in his poems,when describing the custom of foreign races, and personally lauds it.St. Gregory Nazienzen refers to it in oneof his Epigrams, and declares another secret motive forfather wasthis custom, which was that thereby the86THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEassured of the legitimacy of the child.This strangecustom of the people, and the property of the waters ofthis river, is made manifest to us by its own name ofRhine, which, in the language of the Germans and theDutch, means pure, chaste, and without alloy.All thismust have been to Jerome and Bonosus, newly-bornChrist, a noble subject for their spiritualchildren inmeditations and exercises, for to them also was known thecustom and the properties of those waters.It wouldseem that they had purposely come there direct from thebosom of their Mother Church, in order to prove themselves by early and hard penance, and, so to speak, totemper themselves from early boyhood to become saints,and in the company of those barbarous people to hardenthemselves in those cold waters, in order to be able lateron to know how to comport themselves in the midst ofgreat encounters, discomforts, austerities, hunger, andrude treatment.Furthermore, it appears to me, theydesired to prove themselves in the purity of those waters,frequently betaking themselves to the river's bank, andimmersing themselves in the cold stream, in order topunish the irregular motions of youth.Turning theireyes towards heaven, and lifting up their souls in prayer,they must have uttered words of the following effect totheir Lord and Father Jesus Christ: “Lord!It hasbeen done as Thou didst will. Thou hast engendered us,Thy children, in the holy bosom of Thy Church ! Andin Thy inscrutable wisdom Thou didst will that it shouldhave been in Rome: we have been born again in Thy precious blood, and our souls are still quivering in its burningpower!Lord! Do Thou prove us in these icy, flowingwaters, and see whether for Thy love we can bear themLord! Do thou acknowledge us as Thy legitimatechildren, in order that from henceforth we may call thee,STUDIES IN FRANCE87with a voice of confidence and full of lively hope, “OurPather / O Father and Lord! preserve in our heartsthe purity of our baptismal innocence which this riverwith its name brings back to our memory; and since wedid cast into the waters of baptism the poison of theancient serpent, and the old Adam remained buried inthem, enkindle and infuse in these present waters Thyholy love (for this we owe Thee as to our Father) andThy holy fear, which as to our Lord we render Thee;and by the icy coldness of these waters let the flesh andits desires be chilled, and its warmth all withdrawn intothe soul, in order that with ardent desires we may seekThee and serve Thee.And, whereas against the changesof time this river still preserves in the mother tonguethe purity of its ancient dwellers, who were distinguishedby the simplicity and chastity of their lives, do Thou, OLord, preserve in us, despite all the assaults of this worldand the powers of evil, this our first investiture—the purebeing of Christian. May our life correspond with ourname; may the loyalty we owe Thee continue as long aslife; and permit not that these creatures of Thine shouldacknowledge any other Father, nor our souls love anyother spouse.”These and similar motives for holy thought and exercises did that dwelling-place suggest to them, for allthings are of profit to such as walk with desires ofderiving advantage.We have also good reasons for supposing that theysuffered during their first residence in France many discomforts and dangers, privations and rude treatments,fears and sadness — two youths of such tender age,unknown, without relatives, friends, or protectors, and,moreover, surrounded by barbarous people and in astrange country, far distant from home, what else could be88THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEexpected?Yet, I know not what to think—for when Iconsider this epoch in the life of our saint I am amazed.At times it appears to me to be the desert of St. John theBaptist, although I perceive the difference; at other timesI call to mind the lion's den of Daniel, and though not thesame, yet it partakes of the good and the evil of bothepisodes; for it does not appear to me so fearful or sodangerous to live alone in the desert among the wildbeasts, because I know they lack reason and are notlashed to attack you unless driven to do so, as it is to livewith men, who although to all appearance they possessreason, yet never make use of it, and are roused to furyand persecute simply for a whim.Because, when mangives way to his passions, no animal can be compared tohim. The King of Babylon was more concerned for thefate of Daniel, when the prophet was in the lion's den, onaccount of the fury which men might visit him with ifbrought out, than for the harm the lions would do to himwhen inside the pit, and for this reason he ordered theentrance to the pit to be sealed to prevent the populacefrom above killing him, to whom the lions below didhomage.Such as these, or worse, were the men with whom atsuch an early age our saint had to live with, for nearly allinhabitants of those shores were cannibals. We mightwell add, in view of what has been said already, and whatJerome had already experienced, that many saints whomwe hold to be great might well have been content to endhere, where in truth our saint was only commencing,-asthe history of his life will reveal to us,—but God hadcreated Jerome to be very great indeed in His Church,and therefore from his tenderest years He tries and provesOh, divinehim in things very lofty and very difficult.goodness, how continued must his tears have flowed !STUDIES IN FRANCE89How deep his sighs!

What, however, we knowfor certain is that he sojourned many days in the city ofTrèves, where the great Defender of the Faith, Athanasius,Bishop of Alexandria, had been exiled not long before.Epist. 11.9oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEDuring these travels the occupations of Jerome were notworthless ones, nor his halts made without derivingadvantage.In those days Trèves was a most flourishingleft theUniversity, but a few years after our saintFrench themselves destroyed it in the time of Honorius;yet at the time we speak of the study of sacred and profaneletters was carried out so brilliantly that it resembledanother Athens. And the renown of studies pursued inthis University dates very far back, for even in the timeof Maximian and of Diocletian, as we learn from Sigonius'that the élite of France used to resort to Trèves; andwhen Acrisius was sent thither by Pope St. Sylvester andthe Emperor Constantine, it is known for certain that herestored the studies and letters, which had been laid aside,to their pristine renown, exchanging, however, pagan andprofane studies for Christian and Catholic ones.This isproved by a writing of the Emperor Gratian, whereinmention is made of the Belles-Lettres which flourished inthat city.It was at Trèves that our Jerome lingered, for, likeanother Plato, he ever sought in his journeys through theworld what would best benefit his soul; and in order thatthe Church of Christ should possess a Jerome, all this wasat TrèvesAmong his occupations whilenecessary!was that of transcribing, with his own hand, the Book ofSynods of the holy Prelate Hilary. The reason for doingso was because this work examined and treated upon theprincipal articles of our faith, viz., the mystery of the mostholy Trinity, and the mystery of the Incarnation of theWord, and these points were there so clearly defined bythe canons and decrees of the councils which had beenheld against Arius and Sabellius, and against the restof the heretics who up to that period had dogmatised andCarol. sign. lib. 1. et Io. De Occident imper.STUDIES IN FRANCE91withdrawn themselves from the teaching of the Church inregard to those two mysteries, that it seemed to Jerome,as a prudent student, that it was an affair of the greatestimportance to fix once for all, and discern with all truth,what on these points had been determined by the sacredcouncils, as well as what the ancient fathers and the saintshad written and commented upon, in regard to thesemysteries, in order that he might walk securely along thepath of the sacred Scriptures, not trusting to his own genius,nor attempting rash heights in matters of so much subtletyand grandeur.Jerome makes mention of this good occupation of hiswhen writing to Florentius, where he entreats him to sendhim two books, one on the Exposition of the Book of thePsalms and the other of the “Synods of St. Hilary,”which he himself had transcribed with his own hand whenThis Paulus wasin Trèves, for the saintly aged Paulus.a very pious man, with whom he formed a sincere friendship (for the saints soon learn to know one another), andit was on account of this friendship that, some years later,he wrote the life of Malchus, a captive monk.At that time this city of Trèves possessed great relicsof antiquity, of which, no doubt, our saint had muchinformation, for he was very diligent in his researches, andneglected no opportunity of learning; hence itis mybelief that he derived much knowledge respecting thosecelebrated men of France, who were called Druids, abouttheir religion, theirdoctrine and divine secrets, andwhich are not far removed from those which are professedsacrifices, and cereby Christianity, also of their rites,monies, in which some even venture to say there arefound great sacraments.an occasion maypresent itself later on to treat more fully of this matter.PerhapsAd Florent, Epist. 6.92THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEWe have no further light to guide us as to what else heI can, however, at least affirm thatdid whilst in France.during these travels he learnt much and advanced greatlyin the study of letters, and that he returned much benefitedby the experience he had acquired, the many things hehad seen, and also from his communications with thelearned men he had met in all the provinces.Under the name of Gaul was then understood whatis now called Flanders and Lower Germany and otherprovinces.DISCOURSE THE SECONDSt. Jerome returns from France. He seeks Entrance intoHere is declared what it is to enter intoa Profession.the Profession of the Church; and what was the Monastic State in former Times.JEROME, like a solicitous bee of Christ, had gatheredalready the flowers and the liquor for that which was ofmoment for his work, his heart enriched, and his vessel asit were filled with all that he had culled from his intercourse with learned men. He decided to return to hisnative land, not only to Stridon, his birthplace in theorder of nature, but also to Rome, where in the order ofgrace he had been re-engendered in Christ. The timewas approaching when our Lord was going to reveal to theworld what He had deposited in that illustrious youth,and for what lofty things He had destined him. Heinspired him with the determination to return, so that heshould put away all the things of the world.Hemaintained a great recollection, pondering always on whatkind of life he should choose which would be most pleasingto his Lord Jesus Christ. And whereas it was his ardentwish from his earliest years to serve God, his life andconversation all tended to that end.He would laybefore Him in prayer this affair, beseeching Him toenlighten him concerning an act of so much importance,93THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEand for this end he performed many exercises of devotionand piety. He considered all the differentstates ofa Christian life, and being endowed with a lofty mind heinvestigated and examined the objections of each; yetstates of Holy Church appeared to him good andallsaintly, and all tended, though by different paths, to theIn all of them he saw that the flowersone and same end.of piety flourished, and that saints rose up resplendent,though on further investigation he did not find in allwhat he sought for the purpose which was nearest hisheart, and they did not quite fulfil his desires. Hejudged to be holy the state of matrimony, albeit itinvolved according to his mind many obligations anda dire servitude, rendering a man subject, as the Apostlesays, to the tribulations of the flesh, to the demands ofattentiona wife, and her caprices and whims, hisdevoted to the bringing up of his children, a prey tocupidity in the affairs of his property, with the object ofbenefiting them, engrossed with the care of his servantsand family—in a word, divided into a thousand parts, hewhose desire was to give himself up completely to onegreat affair—the love and service of his God alone.

JEROMEvain and proud, so that he altogether forgets what hecame from. And behind this door a hundred othergates are opened, through which enter in a furioustroop of vices, which leave him so disfigured and ghastlythat he remains as though under an evil spell and besidehimself, without knowing those whom he converses with,hateful to God and to men, because the offices andministries which the Holy Spirit has divided throughoutthe body of the Church were not formed in order to puffup individuals, despising others, as we are taught by thetwo princes of the Apostles, but to serve their brethrenaccording to the rules of our Master Jesus Christ, inwhich He ordains that the greater be as the lesser, forasmuchas His school is not like the palaces of the Gentile princes.All these things did our saintly youth view with attentivegaze, and every moment he was turning away from theworld and all its affairs, and through these very investigations was learning more and more to despisethe world and to cast himself with greater earnestnessinto the loving arms of Jesus Christ, while the fire ofthe Holy Spirit took firmer possession of his soul.Hence, viewing dispassionately and leisurely all things;pondering over them one by one, and weighing the interestwhich might accrue to him in the different states of theChurch, he found that what more nearly approached hisideal, and by which he could the better renounce the worldand the things of the world, and attain more nearlyevangelical perfection, as also the surest path (albeit thenarrowest) by which he could follow in the footsteps of ourLord Jesus Christ, was the monastic life. That holy statewhich (in comparison to life in the world which has beenregenerated and merged in the purity of the Christianlife) is also called the religious life. This resolution he1 2 Peter.CHOICE OF PROFESSION97took firmly, and, without delaying or wavering in hispurpose, he at once sought to put into execution. Fromthat moment he placed himself entirely in the hands of hisLord and Master, Who had been bestowing on him fromhis earliest years the principles of that science, which withso much reason is called the “science of the saints." Oh,blessed is he who from a child becomes accustomed to theburden of Thy sweet yoke, O Lord!For thus dostThou call Thy holy gospels; and blessed is he who shalltaste its sweetness, for, as the prophet says, he will riseabove it, and above all that has a name, for it is thereThou makest known to them Thy name which is ineffable,and is known but by the one who bears it! O Lord!it is not in vain that Thou dost sow those fair seedswith such anticipation, in the earliest years of the lifeof Thy servants, for in due season they will bud forth intocomely trees and produce ripe fruits, and the talents Thoudost entrust to them will yield vast interests.It wastherefore the final resolution of Jerome to embrace thehard life of a monk and to persevere therein until death;and in this decision ended the well-discussed “council ofState.”Now I cannot but marvel, at this point, on the cunningThe enemy loses noof the devil, in his ministers.occasion; he knows how to take advantage of all thingsfor his purposes. Who would dare to say, that, at thisperiod, there could have entered malice P And who wouldsuppose that from this the devil would have taken occasionto combat the various orders of the Church PFor one of the most qualified ministers of Satan,"writing the life of this great Father and Doctor of theChurch, declares that St. Jerome chose the monastic state,because such as in those times of the Church most loved1 Erasmus in Vita D.

JEROMEtheir liberty and were most free, and enemies of beinggoverned by others, lovers of an exterior life, were thosewho chose the profession of monks, and declares thatJerome, being one of this class of persons, chose thisstate for himself from among all others, because he dearlyloved his liberty.And entitling him Doctor of the Church, this historianand searcher of the things of antiquity further adds:“And that no one should make a mistake on this point,let him know that the monks of that time and the monksof the present day are very different; because, as regardsthe former, their property always remained to them, andMoreover,was secured to those who embraced this state.they could go out and return again to their monastery,when, and how they pleased.They lived comfortably,and were free to choose their studies, their fasts, thechanting. of the Psalms, prayers, holy vigils, and the restof the spiritual exercises.

He deniesin the first instance the key of the whole regular monasticstate by withdrawing obedience, and placing in its steadfree liberty.After this he flings down poverty; and thatnought should escape his hands, he altogether denies thatin those times there were any vows! He laughs at theconstitutions and the different modes of life by which thoseare distinguished who agree upon the three vows, essentialand common, and such as are taken in all religious orders.He removes the habit, because even the dress annoys him(such was his hatred for the orders); and asserts that themonks of those times were free, they lived as they willed,came in and went out as they pleased, because by thesemeans he might take away apostacy and censures, and showthat the penalty was nothing more than to be held to besomewhat light-headed, fond of change, and inconstant.Igreatly marvel that among the many things, which wereerased and condemned in the writings of this wickedhistorian and incompetent judge of the ancient religion,and of the life of our saint, this passage was not blottedFor I do not think that there is another passage inout.all his works more impious and malicious than this one.And the life which he has written of our holy doctor ispermeated with similarly base ideas. Had Jerome beenas this wicked author depicts him, he would not have beenIOOTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEgiven us by the Holy Roman Church as a mirror ofsanctity and of learning.Now, in order to expose his ignorance and his malice, itwill be advisable here to declare which are the states in theChurch; what it means to choose a state in it, and what stateof perfection did our Jerome select; whether in those daysreligious perfection was practised by the monks; whatwere the religious at that time, if they were as he depictsthem to us, or like those of our days; what differenceexists between the former communities and the presentones, in order that all should be rightly understood. Thecelestial republic of the Church, which God ordained onearth, is a perfect body, having for its head Jesus Christ.In like manner the republic of the whole creation has ahead which is God, by whom all that exists therein wascreated, from whom all things depend and are sustained andpreserved. And in the same way as in this One God areunited all perfections, or rather they are all one most simpleperfection, without any manner or composition of parts; andthis One, being so great as It is, cannot be contained inany one thing which is a creature, but in the multitudeand infinity of them all (that is to say, could they beinfinite); and is, as it were, divided among them, yetwithout the whole of them being able to—I will not sayexhaust, but not even—form any part or proportion withall their excellences of that One Divine Perfection, whichbeing participated in as Head and Fountain, yet remainsentire.In the same way the fulness of grace which isstored up in the head of the Church, Christ, is dividedthroughout all the various offices, grades, and states ofthis same Church. And this is not accidental or voluntaryin this body, but as native and essential as are the richesand wealth of things which we see, for the perfection ofThis is the philosophy ofthis great body of the universe.CHOICE OF PROFESSIONIOI.St. Paul which he taught the Ephesians in these words(speaking of Christ as coming from God and man), saying,"Ae gave some apostles and some prophets, and others someevangelists, and others some pastors and doctors for theperfecting of the saints, to the end that each oneperforming his office, and each rendering good accountof his works, the edifice of this mystic body of Christ,which is the Church, may be perfected. And in the sameway as in our bodies there are many different members,according as the same apostle learnedly puts it to theRomans,” “and having different gifts given us .. to beused, according to the rule of faith,” each fulfilling itsfunction without interfering or usurping theespecialposition of another, so, too, in the whole body of believersbeing joined together with its head Christ it needs bethat this body be divided in its offices and grades, withoutthe one mingling with the other or introducing itself, orusurping that of another, or through pride despising it,but each one attending to the part which appertains to him,and keeping the code which is given him, in order to fulfilhis duty perfectly, without confounding the hierarchy andorder of this celestial arrangement. One of the thingswhich more greatly astonished the Queen of Shebaand which she admired most in the wisdom of Solomon,was the order in which the whole economy of his housewas arranged, so much so that the sacred scriptures as afact enlarges upon it, declaring that she was amazed anddelighted beyond measure when she beheld the variousoffices so well apportioned, the good order existing amongthe dignitaries of the court, and the officials so well chosenthat no voice of dissension was heard, each one acting inhis own grade and position, so that, despite the greatnumber of attendants and functionaries, not only was thereEphesians iv. 11, 12.Romans xii. v. 6.IO2 .THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEno confusion, but there existed a perfect harmony amongthem.But this man, or those who followed him, did not wishto see all this harmony or distinction of members, noreven a head, for they all detest it. And this is characteristic of the inhabitants of Babylon, citizens of that kingdomwithout order, full of frightful discord. They detest theorder of the tribes of which David sings, of the house of theLord which goes up in set lines, and with the squadronsin order towards the holy city of Jerusalem, so thatwith perpetual praises testimony be given to this One,greater than Solomon, Who arranges it.This is thefoundation, and as it were, the root of the orders in theChurch; from this is produced her beauty; from thissprings her flowers and fruits, and from this also arises,that, on account of her state, she stands intrinsically andessentially immovable and firmly placed, because thatwhich is easily moved or which we can undo at our whim,we do not say of it that it has order, firmness, quietude,nor is of any account. From whence the strong argumentis taken that as to what in the Church is to merit the name oforder, from its fruits a certain reflective respect is cast uponthe person itself of man, in so far as it makes him a servantof freemen, and invests him with any of these conditions.In order fully to understand this in its very foundation,we must remember that in things spiritual, such as arethose of the Church, there are two manners of servitudeand two kinds also of liberty—viz., the servitude or libertyof sin, and the servitude or liberty of justice, as St. Paulteaches when he says: “For when you were the servants ofsin, you were free men to justice. Now being freed fromsin, we have been made servants of fustice .. and becomeservants of God.”" That proneness to sin and slavery ofRomans vi. 18-22..CHOICE OF PROFESSIONIo3the vices, which we notice in men of depraved livesbecause reason is carried captive by the bonds of evilhabits, is called servitude, and is the servitude of sin; buton the contrary in the good aided by the sweet bondsof virtues is found the generous service of justice. Andhe possesses this, who subjects himself, and in lieu ofservitude he finds a great principality, as David besoughtwhen in his penitence he shook off the yoke of the firstservitude and cried out, “Confirm me, O Lord, with thespirit of a Prince,” because, contemning with generousheart the low, mean things of sensual pleasures, he comesforth to the full liberty and lordship of the Prince whoexpects the vast inheritance of the kingdom, and this islawlessness andcalled the liberty of sin.rashness, by which a man without fear of justice runs onin the course of vice as though he had no master, is calledMan, in accordance with the naturalliberty of justice.reason with which he has been endowed (and which is hisnoblest part), is really more inclined to what is right andjust than what is evil and perverse, as being against thenatural inclination of this higher principle.From thisarises that the liberty of sin is that which is properly calledliberty, and it is united lovingly with the subjection whichthis part owes to justice, inclining gently to its service,because the natural right of man so demands.But thatFrom whence is seen at once how the terms cross oneanother—that service and obedience to the vices meansliberty of justice, and obedience and service of justiceimplies the liberty of the vices, and the right order inwhich he was created by his Maker; and, when he doesnot obey the rules of his better nature, he in truth remainscaptive in the bands of sin, taking both the one and theFromother in his own hands and by his own works.1 Psalm l.IO4THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwhich it results that as these works do not attain at onceto the most perfect degree according to their kind, it mustneeds be that they have a beginning, a middle term, andan end.The beginning belongs to such as commence; themiddle term to those who have already passed part of theroad; and the end is for such as have attained the goal,called the perfect state, because nothing is wanting tothem.This is clearly stated by the two Princes of theChurch in parts of their Epistles; I merely touch uponthem in part in our history in order not to lengthen thisLet it be therefore established that in thediscourse.state of being free from sin and serving unto justicethere exist these three grades.This may be considered either in respect to whatpasses in man in the secret of the soul in that part whichonly God sees, or in respect to the exterior in this publicview of the Church in sight of men.In the former (theinterior secret) God alone is the Judge, and the HolySpirit, who is the Architect of that fabric. Of what passesoutwardly (although it is the work also and arrangement ofthe same Spirit) the Church is the judge; because it ispalpable work, the republic of action and of visible policy,of the states and dispositions of His monarchy.God judges, and alone knows who in his interior is abeginner, or who is perfect, and into this the Church doesnot enter; but she judges and knows, who is so outwardly.From which it is made manifest that for one in theChurch to be declared in a state of liberty or servitude itis necessary to have some visible obligation or absolution;since it is not sufficient reason for one to be declaredservant, because he serves, or that he should be freebecause he does not serve, for St. Paul says: “I servedyou through spiritual love and charity at times, and whichCHOICE OF PROFESSIONIoSobligation and solemnity.should be found among you; and as to the fugitive servantflight does not give him the state of freedom.Healone is free who is not bound by a contract of servitude;and that one is a servant who is bound by such a bondand obligation.This contract must be made binding andsolemn, as is customary in all contracts between men, forHence thethe sake of its firmness and permanency.”whole subject is resolved thus—that in order to render ita state, and with reason be called so in the Church, thereFor whichmust intervenecause he who, renouncing the world, freeing himself fromitsservitude, takes refuge in the royal vassalage ofChristian justice, and enters the state of religion, makesa contract between God and himself (at least outwardly),and with all solemnity binds himself to the laws andservice of justice in the state he professes.This was the course our saint chose.This was whathe had determined upon in his heart with all earnestness,because to determine upon being a monk was to adopttruly the state of perfection, desiring to take so arduousa path, withdrawing himself from the common high road,to followThusthe narrow one found by theit adds to the two general points of which I havespoken, solemnity and obligation (which include themarried state and the priesthood), that of perfection, whichis a different (at least in the outward or visible viewof the Church) perfection, I say, essential to the state.For although priests, by reason of their state, may bebound to preserve a very great cleanliness of heart,because they receive daily into their breasts One Whoconsumes hearts alone, are not under the obligation as isproper to religious entailed by their vows of chastity,poverty, and obedience. And if to these we further add,solicitude and desire for the good of the brethren, thefew.IoéTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEgiving up of temporal goods for their necessities, thelaying down of life for the sheep, it will be to form a stateof perfection, I will not say of religious, but of prelatesand pastors of the Church.From thisis also understood what seems incomprehensible to many that a person may be in a state ofperfection, yet be very far from being perfect; and viceversa, we may and can be very perfect without being insuch a state. And this doctrine was practically taught usby Christ in the scene depicted to us by the evangelistSt. Matthew in the parable of the Two Sons. One ofthese told his father he would not go and cultivate thevine, yet he went and worked well at it; the other said hewould go, but in the end never went, and thus did noBecause if the outward act does not correspond towork.the interior will,it would be an affair of no value;whereas the contrary would be the case, if the interioracts on the outward act.

To this St. Paul gives the nameof “human temptation,” when admonishing us not toallow ourselves to be carried away by any but such as ishuman.Hence, from the moment when the public profession and contract is made in the Church (as a sign ofthe interior profession), judgment is made, and we declarewith truth that he who has made it is in the state ofHere the religious must act with greatperfection.circumspection in order that never through a graveencounter or fall he should dismiss from his heart thepurpose of always proceeding on the road, and of derivingprofit from this state of perfection, which undoubtedly hewill do and follow so long as this intention does not cease,and he follows the path taught him by the holy laws, vows,and constitutions, notwithstanding that a thousand timeshe should stumble, and as many times fall.This is what appertains to the orders in the Church.Through not following this rule did Erasmus utter hisinventions, and who says that those who were most freein those holiest of times became monks, forasmuch asthis state was one of much liberty!It is thus made clearthat the contrary to his assertions is the actual fact, andIo8THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwe see how Jerome did not embrace this holy statewith any such base ideas.I would willingly enter into arefutation of all that this inventor and other heretics havesown broadcast in those times, as well as they do in ourdays, against the monastic state, to whom the name ofmonk was odious, and this refers to every description ofheretic; for this subject and refutation has been treatedupon by many pious men with great erudition.But it isan affair in which the honour of the universal Church isconcerned to show the truth and antiquity of the monasticstate, so loved and cherished by her, because in assumingto remove it the heretics pretend to lead us to understandthat she has been hitherto deceived in what they areLet us, therefore, brieflypleased to call an invention.explain the antiquity and origin of the monastic state,and how in its essential part it has ever been the samethroughout the ages of the Church.I wish in the first place to mention that there is noancient saint, who so clearly and so frequently treats onthe matter of the vows, especially on the vow of chastity,as Jerome did.I have no intention to go so far as to saythat holy Henoch was the first monk, although there aregrave doctors who do affirm this, that he invented andinstituted some particular worship and system of reverencefor God, as is recorded of him in the Book of Genesis,” andtaught by him in the first ages.Because, although Adam,Abel, Seth, and other patriarchs of that first age, of whomno mention is made, honoured God and served Him, andinvoked Him, yet only of Henoch, with the especialapproval of the Holy Ghost, is it said that he began tohonour God, and to invoke Him; and the Hebrew word,which is there used not only means to invoke and to call,but it also means to call to meeting and congregation, or as1 Peter Martyr.Genesis v.CHOICE OF PROFESSIONIo9though we should say into community.Neither do I wish totreat of the Nazarites, of whom, according to the Book ofNumbers, it is stated that they consecrated themselves toGod; nor of the sons of the Prophets, who, in the schooland obedience of Elias and Eliseus, lived without wife orproperty, whereby is clearly illustrated the observance ofthe three vows, and of whom Origen and Jerome say thatfollowing their example there were many in the Church;and when writing to Paulinus,” the saintly doctor callsthem their princes, captains, and guides among the othershe names.Nor do I wish to bring forward the sons ofRechab,” of whom Jeremias gives such an illustriousmemoir, because both Jeremias in his writings and St.Jerome in the same epistle depicts them in such wise, thatwould to Heaven we, the monks of these days, were asthey, although we pride ourselves on being very strict andYet I might, to come nearer our purpose,penitential.bring forward in proof of the antiquity of the monasticrule him whom all monks with perfect truth call its prince,Baptist – of whom the ancientnamely, St. John thefathers, Basil, the two Gregories of Nazianzen and Nyssa,John Chrysostom and many others laud so greatly for thispurpose, putting aside the high degree which our Lordassigned to him, when, in the prophecy spoken by theevangelist, He declared him to be above all men “bornof woman.”Our Jerome, too, speaking of the same,declares to the virgin Eustochium that the Prince ofHermits was St. John the Baptist.Let us, however,omit all these ancient Fathers and these first examples ofthe monastic life; and closing the Old Testament, let usopen the New, so that none may say “we speak inshadows,” and let us manifest the new light, which theyso arrogantly and falsely attribute to themselves.1 Numbers vi.Epist. 13.Jeremias xxxv.1 IoTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEThe first whom in good conscience we might allege,in order to prove the antiquity of the monks of the NewTestament, is Philo, who compiled a whole book, entitledVita Supplicum, where in eloquent style, as is his wont, hedepicts the life of these holy religious, the first saintlyfruits of the true evangelical life under the discipline andrule of the great evangelist St. Mark; wherein he, moreclearly than the light of day, sets down three essentialvows, in addition to other most holy ceremonies; and oursaintly doctor from him gathers for his own work onAllustrious Men what the Church was in her principles, andthe decline into which, even in the time of the saint, shewas falling, and that it was this that the monks aimed at toreform and renew. The divine Dionysius, the Areopagite,wrote an epistle to Demophilus, the monk, the title ofwhich suffices; but in the sixth chapter of the EcclesiasticalHierarchy he writes so largely and piously the life, profession, and order of the monks that it suffices to readit to have a summary of the question.I say, therefore,that the institutors and founders of this life and monasticstate were the apostles, as appears by the Acts of theApostles, by which it will be seen that all such as calledthemselves disciples of Christ had nothing of their own,all things being common, neither did any one say thataught was his own.Yet this was not a thing adopted byall, who newly entered the Christian religion, and came intothe body of the Church, and who were called believers, butonly such as aspired to follow a narrower and more arduouspath of perfection, as appears from the fifth chapter of thesaid Acts of the Apostles, where in a detailed manner thenarrative is given of the punishment which the Holy Ghostmeted out through the hands of St. Peter to Ananias andSapphira, because, after having commenced this road of1 Acts iv.CHOICE OF PROFESSIONIIIFor so did St. Peter tell them.perfection, they fraudulently kept back part of the price ofthe lands which they had sold, when it had been in theirpower to be Christians similarly to many others who wereso, yet retained their lands without taking the vow ofpoverty.That this wasdone under obligation of a vow is affirmed by St. Augustinein the books of the City of God,” where he says, “This vowthey had made, and bound themselves to, these mostpowerful ones,” and continues to speak of the apostles.And that orders and the monastic life had commenced withthem and from that time, and that with their exampleother orders followed up to the present day, is stated byall the Fathers and Doctors of the Church–Eusebius,Jerome, Augustine, Isidore, Posidonius, and others, whilstJohn Cassian, who discussed this subject very lucidly, saysthat the cenobitical institution took its rise at the comThat in those timesmencement of the Gospel preaching.there were fixed habits and constitutions is declared to usby our doctor, as we shall see in the course of this historyof his life, and it is well known by such as peruse ecclesiastical histories.Hence, in a brief manner, we havemade clear who in those times were monks, and thatthe religious of these days are similar as regards theessential points, as well as in many of the details of theirlife, and we also perceive that when our glorious Jeromeresolved to embrace a state in the Church he chose themore perfect and strict one of monk.I will proceed to quote in proof of this, and in orderto speak the truth and make it known more clearly whatthe saint himself says of his resolve, and the strength ofspirit, with which he undertook so arduous a purpose.Inagainst John of Jerusalem he says:"—hisepistleActs vi. 4.August., De Civit. lib. 17, c. iv. circa medium.Ad Parnac. contra Joan. Hierosolym., Epist. 61.II 2THE LIFE OF ST.

How boldly isheadway made now (for our sins!) for the pinnacle ofpriestly dignities and pontificates, taking as guides forsuch immeasured steps ambition and interest !I wishnow to impose silence on language so odious, and bring toa conclusion so long a discourse, happy in having demonstrated how earnestly our pious youth undertook thesevere strict state of the monk—and what is meant bythat state in the Church, and that the monastic state ofour times and that of former ages were intrinsically oneand the same, and will always be, please God, so long asHis Church lasts, despite the gates of Hell.DISCOURSE THE THIRDSt. Jerome declares to his Parents and Friends his ResolutionHere is stated the Place selectedof becoming a Monk.for carrying out his Purpose.ONCE the saintly youth had fixed and determined upon thenew rule and life of perfection he had resolved to follow,he at once proceeded to reveal his intentions to his friendson his return to Rome, and induce them, if possible, tofollow him by encouraging them to undertake so high aresolve. Among these friends was Bonosus, who, like afaithful Achates, had been his devoted companion, as wehave already said, and with whom he had made his journeythrough France, for they were both united in sentimentand as though there existed but one soul between them;their thoughts were alike, and his companionship hadproduced such good fruits that now Jerome's desirewas to appeal to him with burning words.It must havebeen a source of deep joy to the saintly Bonosus tocomprehend the lofty aims of his beloved Jerome, whilsthe, in his turn, manifested to Jerome his own, which wereno less high, and differed in nothing. Some” hold thatthe first to carry out the scheme was Bonosus, but theyare in error, because it is clearly proved that it was afterour saint had retired to the desert that Bonosus withdrew1 Erasmus in Vita.II4ENTERS THE MONASTIC STATE115to an island of Dalmatia.This became known to ourdoctor through letters which he actually received whilst inthe desert, written by Chromatius, Jovinius, and Eusebius,by conduct of his friend Evagrius who lived in Antioch.In order to judge what were the feelings of oursaintly doctor regarding this friend so dearly loved byhim, let us hear what he pens to his later-on inconstantfriend, Rufinus by name, in a letter sent from the desert.“Thy Bonosus and mine is ascending already thatfigurative ladder which Jacob saw in a dream; he carrieshis cross; he no longer thinketh of the morrow nor ofyesterday, but goeth sowing in tears, so as to gather injoy and plenitude, and, like to another Moses, he raisethaloft the mystic serpent in the desert.Be conquered andadmit the superior advantage, O ye fabulous marvels anddreamed of deeds, couched in the elegant diction of Romanand Greek writings! Come and behold here a youth whowas brought up among ourselves, and was instructed inthe strict discipline of the age, possessing abundantwealth, whilst few could surpass him in dignity of lineage;and who forsaking mother, brothers, and sisters, wentforth to live on an island, where the roar of the oceanwave is heard continually breaking upon the pebbly shoreand amid the broken rocks; in a rough deserted spot,alone, in a frightful solitude, he rises up like a newinhabitant of Paradise !“You will not find him there with husbandmen to tillthe soil, nor even monks to be his companions, no, noteven that little servant, the childish Onesimus, whom youknew so well, and whom he loved with a brother's love,and who might serve him, nor does he have him at hisside |There, on this solitary spot, he stands alone, no, Iwill not say alone, but in the company only of JesusThere, he witnesses the glory of God, which,Christ.116THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEunless on the deserted mountain, not even the apostleswere privileged to see. He does not look towards theproud cities of men, because he is already admitted to theDisfiguredfellowship and enrolment of the New City.and emaciated are his limbs by the stiff, rough sackclothhe wears, yet he will thereby the better sally forth to theencounter, and be transfigured with Christ on the heightsof the cloud. He has no luxuriant gardens, arranged withnew conduits of water to flow on and fall in cascades andshoot up with the object of pleasing the sight, but hedrinks from the open side of Christ the abundant waters ofLife.”Many other things of equal beauty does this mosteloquent saint describe to us, manifesting thereby the joysand sweetness that he experienced in his solitary life.Ifeel loth to pass them by, but I fear to become toolengthy were I to dwell on the erudition and elegance ofdiction of our doctor.All this, however, will necessarilybe made manifest from the hold his heavenly words andcounsels effected in the breast of this sincere and saintlyfriend.Jerome informed also Pammachius of his purpose toenter the monastic state, and though in genius and inlearning they were both very similar, and their ideasgreatly in common, they were not, however, alike in thepath of life they should follow by embracing the religiousPammachius desired to marry, which in truth hestate.eventually did, and thus each took a different road.InHeliodorus Jerome's words found a better hearing, and hisHence he offeredpersuasion produced a greater effect.with right goodwill to follow that state which his companion encouraged him to embrace, although, as we shallfind farther on, he eventually forsook it after he had dweltin the desert for some time with Jerome, having alteredENTERS THE MONASTIC STATE117his purpose.Jerome likewise communicated to Rufinusof Aquileia his resolve of becoming a monk, and toInnocentius, Evagrius, and to Hylas, the servant ofNicetas, subdeacon of Aquileia, did not accomMelania.pany him on this journey, but after he had been sometime in the desert established a great friendship with him,and became a powerful helper in the designs of the saint.To all these friends did Jerome manifest his heart, andendeavoured to win them over to join him in his line ofDuring the course of this history we shall be able tolife.state in its proper place what became of each of them.There now remained for Jerome to choose the placeAfter maturewhere this devout life was to be followed.deliberation on this important question weighing all thepros and cons, he deemed that it would not be prudent toremain in his own country nor in the adjoining lands,because to be in continual communication with kindredand friends, and to listen to their affairs and trials, mustgreatly disturb and break upon that recollection andquietude which this holy state requires and demands.Furthermore, the manners of the people of those countrieswere very barbarous, their lives characterised by thevices of gluttony and avarice; moreover, at the time theyhad for their pastor in spiritual things a priest calledLupicinus, of whom Jerome did not approve, and despitethe fact that he was but a youth, yet he did not like hisevil habits.All this does he say when writing to Eusebius,Jovinius, and Chromatius:” “In my native land, rude andperverse manners prevail, men have for God their belly,and they think of nothing but of enjoying themselves andpassing idly the sunny days, and he is considered mostholy who possesses most money; added to this we have1 Epist. 18.118THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMELupicinus the priest,” etc.These reasons were sufficientto deter the saint from choosing his country for carryingout so lofty an aim of life amid company that was so low. .‘How harmful and inconvenient it is for a religiousto live amid parents and relatives, and thus have continually brought before him the joys and sorrows, thehomes and hearths of loved ones, is learnedly treated uponby the heavenly doctor in his Epistle to Rusticus, themonk, while experience has also manifested and provedits wisdom by many dire examples and sad falls. On theother hand, he turned his eyes to Rome, his new country,and he was not pleased either with that holy city as thechosen spot for his lofty aims in the Christian life, despiteBecause,that they were humble in the eyes of the world.although he should hold the holy city as such, and that shewas enriched by sacred trophies and relics, so empurpledby the crimson blood of many martyrs. And witnessed inher the pure and sincere confession of the faith of thosewho had sown therein those fair seeds from Heaven sprungfrom that one grain which fell and died on this earth, inorder that by means of so divine a fruit to cast a blessingupon the whole world.Yet, notwithstanding all this, itappeared to Jerome far removed from what the monasticlife should be, thus to dwell amid such a multitude ofmen of varied conditions, nature, and foreign peoples aswere to be found in Rome.It seemed to him that his lifethere would be far removed from the calm, sweet silencewhich should be cultivated in the secret of the spirit bysuch as desire to practise sanctity and interior justice, asthe prophet Isaias describes, thus to see and be seen, to visitand be visited, from all which results manifestly a numberof distractions and hindrances which impede the soul fromseeking God, and desiring to do His holy will before allI cannot refrain from quoting here the words ofthings.ENTERS THE MONASTIC STATEII9Jerome himself when, writing to Marcella and inviting herto his beloved Bethlehem, he addresses to her respectingthese things in the following words: “Let us come to thetown and hostel of Mary—since each one praises his ownbelongings. With what words or in what tongue shall Ireverence and praise and depict this cave of the Lord, thatIt is better for it tocrib wherein the infant Christ weptbe lauded by silence than by words, which must alwaysbe inadequate.” And farther on he adds: “Behold ! forin this small cave in the land of Bethlehem was born theMaker of Heaven; it was here that He was wrapped inswaddling clothes; here was He visited by the shepherds;here did the star manifest Him, and here it was that theMagi adored Him! I firmly believe that it is a muchholier place than the Tower of Tarpeia, for, having beenmany times struck by Heaven with its fire, shows that itI admit that it is there (inis not very pleasing to God.Rome) that the Holy Church dwells, that it holds thetrophies and relics of the holy apostles and the martyrs,that there the true confession of Christ is made; it was therethat the faith was preached by the princes of the Church,and on that spot paganism was trampled in the dust.Where day by day the name of Christian is beingraised more and more on high; but, on the other hand,ambition, power, the grandeur of the city, to see and beseen, to salute and be saluted, the praises and murmurings, hearing them and speaking of them, and to bemoving amid such a concourse of peoples, are all thingsvery far removed from the monastic purpose and quietude.Because, if we sally forth to see and to speak to those whocome to visit us, silence is lost, while if we do not go out weare held to be proud; and at times, in order to show ourselvespolite and well-bred, we go forth to return the visits of1 Epist. 18.I2OTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthose who have visited us, and thus have to cross theirsuperb thresholds and doors, amid gilded colonades, andeven to pass between lines of gossiping servants andBut in this hamlet of Christ, as we said above,slaves.there is naught else to be found but a holy austerity, wherethe psalms are sung, and when these are ended naught isheard, all is silence, and whithersoever you may turn youreyes you will perceive that the labourer with his handclenching the plough tills the land singing “Alleluias.”And in the midst of gathering the harvest the reaper, hotand weary from his exertions, arrests his labours to singpsalms; and he who, with hooked knife, is pruning thevines is heard hymning something of what David sang.This is the native music of this land, this the songs oflove (as the people say) that rise up at all hours.”In view of the aforesaid, Jerome took the final resolution of withdrawing very far from these lands and seeking ahabitation which should of itself raise the mind to spiritualthings, and by its holy memories and dwellers invite tothat perfection of life which a monk should aspire to. Tono land in the world did these conditions seem to himto apply better than to the one which, by reason of somany mercies bestowed and so many favours receivedfrom heaven, had merited the renowned name of Holy, andtherefore his final resolve was to make the Holy Land hisdwelling-place.It appeared to our blessed Jerome that for thisso difficult undertaking it would be well to go provided with the necessary arms, and with the aids mostadapted for his purpose, yet such aids would not be simplygold and abundance of silver, nor with a goodly supply ofso-called necessaries of life such as food, apparel, slaves,and servants, but with a large collection of very goodbooks, pious, instructive, and treating of highest perENTERS THE MONASTIC STATE12 Ifection.Wherefore, he gathered together a large library,in order that in those vast solitudes where he purposed toend his days these books should be his companions.Ibelieve myself that God put this scheme into his soul, andthat it was His inspiration, because as He was trainingHis Jerome to be a light to many monks and a patternfor enclosed hermits, and to be a support for the comfortof penitents, yet also to be a doctor of the Church—andsuch a doctor !—it was necessary that all his treasuresshould not consist solely of hair shirts, chains, disciplines,and pebbles, but that he should possess a good supplyof sacred books and other good ones in order that, proceeding from one exercise to another, from prayer tostudy, from meditation to lessons, from penance andmortification to the highest contemplation—like to a cupof purest gold which from the crucible and the forge goesto the goldsmith's hammer, and from under the graver'stool and the file to the fire—he should come forth amasterpiece of such exquisite, highly finished work as wenow behold him in the grand workshop of the Church !These two things—Reading and Prayer—help eachother most gallantly, because in prayer we speak to God,and there we reveal to Him our souls and place in Hishands our miseries and weaknesses, and beseech Him thatHe should supply our deficiencies, cure, and heal us of oursicknesses.While in reading God speaks to us, He tellsus His secrets, reveals to us His will, manifests to us Hispaths; thus, by both the one and the other things, thesoul acquires what it cannot easily attain by any other wayHence if, with a pure heart, webut by these two means.approach the holy books, we will, without doubt, see inthem what in truth it behoves us to know; but, as at mosttimes we are carried to them by curiosity, vanity, ambition,and by that false thirst for knowledge in order that othersI 2.2THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEshould know that we are learned, and also to be able tostand forward and cause an impression, and the world speakof us, therefore, we come out as blind as when we wentin, and sometimes worse, for even of this divine sciencedid the Apostle speak to the Corinthians: “Knowledgepuffeth up, maketh us vain, and illudes us; he who ispuffed up has nothing within but air, and this is the reasonwhy most things end in smoke.”Were we to ask, as did this glorious father anddoctor, raising our hands to heaven with purity of heart,and with tears, the faithful witness of the clean desire ofthe soul, for the light which is wanting to us, we shouldobtain that grace from God, as he drew forth light andinstruction from the treasury of the holy scriptures, sosealed and closed to interpretation owing to the sins ofmen; there would not happen to us and to so many menthat seeing we do not perceive, and hearing we do notunderstand, and reading we do not comprehend, for whichreason does St. John tell us in his Revelations, “He thatAnd God Himself, Hisreadeth, let him understand.”apostles and prophets, have in strong words threatened uswith the punishments of this blindness and deafness.For the love of God let us learn of our saint, andlisten with him to that holy praise which the royal prophetapplies to himself, when he says that he had more prudencethan all his enemies, and that he comprehended more thanall those who taught him, and knew more than all theancients; and all this knowledge he attained by lookingattentively into the law, the precepts, and mandates of theLord.Within three short verses did he inclose all thewisdom and science of men, which withstands the craft ofthe enemies, the skill and genius of the masters, or foundin the lengthened experience of the old men; and there isPsalm crxviii.ENTERS THE MONASTIC STATE123no other means of knowledge.Against these three hepits the attentive consideration and the holy study of theprecepts, the testimonies, and mandates of God, whichmakes him prudent, learned, and wise.It was for thisend that our doctor made such a costly and careful provision of books, which he collected together with so muchlabour, both as regards those he was able himself to obtainand which he transcribed by his own hand when hesojourned in Gaul, as well as those that by means ofmoney, and by the help of his friends, he gatheredtogether throughout Italy, and more especially in Rome.He dwells on this himself when, writing to Eustochium, hesays that in the desert he had the library of books whichin Rome he had gathered together with great diligenceand labour. He mentions the same library in the Epistleto Florentius, where he says as follows: “Do you knowthat, by the favour of Heaven, I have a large assortment ofLet us lend and ask each other at times forgood books.anything which you may desire.I will send it to youwith right good will, without feeling regret in doing whatyou may demand of me.” By these words it will be seenin passing that our doctor was not miserly, as is generallythe case with great collectors of books, for, as they wishthem to adorn their rooms, they grieve, if any of thebooks are wanting, on account of the deficiency it makesamong the others.Having done this, either in part or onthe whole, our saint proceeded to inform his parents of hispurpose, in order to receive from them their blessing onI do not know whether he went alonethis undertaking.Great indeed must have beenor with his companions.the pleasure felt at his coming and for his visit, but whenthey heard of his determination of becoming a monk, thatpleasure must have been marred, and sorrow and regretEpist. 22, cap. 18.I24THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEhave entered their hearts; and although the saint doesnot record the difficult time he had with them on thisoccasion, it is easy to understand how painful it must havebeen.For who is there but can understand the feelingsof a parent who, after bringing up his son, and he theeldest and the heir, that he should come to such anextreme resolution as that of leading a life in the wilderness?And what the feelings of the tender mother ?Even when the beloved child happens to be the wild andtroublesome one of the family? Yet what joy must notbe theirs when they perceive their son return to themhumble, obedient, discreet, and, above all, saintly? Whatwill the parents of our great father do when they see himso determined upon undertaking so rough a life; andmoreover, at such a distance, where it would take monthsto reach, encountering great perils of life, and from whenceit would be only by a miracle that a letter could be receivedfrom him; and thus is it explained by the fact that amongall his epistles there is not one for his mother or for hisfather?Many must have been the pleadings of his parents toinduce him to alter his resolution. And this opinion ofmine is clearly defined from the determined words of thesame holy doctor, which he writes to Heliodorus in theeloquent epistle (the first of his works) which he composedat the time when the farewells and departure from allthings was still fresh in his mind, and where, among othersubjects, he speaks as follows: “Although the babynephew should cling to your neck, and your mother, withdishevelled hair, should show you her tender breastswhence you drew your nourishment; and despite thatyour father should cast himself on the threshold of thedoor—pass over him with tearless eyes, and fly to theStandard of the Cross, because to be cruel in this passageENTERS THE MONASTIC STATEI25of your life is not cruelty but signal piety.”I imagine hespeaks of himself, because at this time Heliodorus had nolonger parents living, and therefore he adds farther on :“I know not what manacles are those which bind you anddetain you; I, myself have not my heart so made of iron,nor my interior so strong, nor was I brought up amongfierce tigers, nevertheless I have passed through as greatan ordeal myself.Now, perchance, the widowed sister maycast her arms around your neck; now, perhaps, thoseservants who grew up with you in the house may tell you,‘Alas! Master! why are you leaving us? And whom doyou leave in your place for us to serve?”Perchance theaged foster-mother who nursed you, and the venerabletutor, who holds the place of a second father, may complain,and cry out beseeching you to stay awhile and not leavethem until you should have buried them; or your oldnurse may come to you, and with gentle words speak toyou the sweet words with which she invited you as a babeto her breasts; in a word, even if the whole house should,as it were, fall upon you, easily may you, with love divineand the fear of hell before you, break asunder all theseties and bonds.” Who can fail to perceive in these wordsthe vivid picture of what the saint must have passedthrough in regard to his parents, his brothers, his tutorand servants?And, forasmuch as it comes to the point here, let ussee what he says farther on, and how he replies to the arguments we suspect his father may have made use of “Theholy scriptures command that we should obey our parents:that is true; but he who loves them more than Christloses his soul.The enemy stands with uplifted arm,knife in hand, to take life from me, and am I to standthinking of the mother's tears? Am I to forsake themilitia of Christ for my father, when even the precept of126THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEburying them (which is a precept imposed by our LordHimself and binds me to do), should it be in the way toprevent or delay me in following, I am not obliged to keep,nor do I owe it to them.” From this may be seen howfully replied to are the complaints and reasons whichparents may urge and represent to their children, and inorder that to none may they be of effect, since they are ofno value for those who are somewhat enlightened, unlessit be such as through malice are vested in ignorance, letthem know that on this point children are under no obligation to their parents, save under two conditions—one, thatthey be of age to be able, according to the holy institutionsof the Church, to be subject to the laws of the state, as hasbeen said; and secondly, that their parents be not placedin such need that without the help and succour of theirchildren they should be unable to support life, because insuch a case the natural precept of obedience and paternalduty is to be enforced.Beyond these two conditionsthere are no other obligations or rights; rather, as St.Bernard very clearly teaches, “God is the only lawful andnecessary cause for not obeying parents, since our LordHimself so clearly tells us that he who loveth father ormother more than Himself is not worthy of Him.” And,indeed, greatly should parents rejoice who truly love theirchildren when they see them rushing into the arms of theuniversal Father, for it is from Him that we have all thatwe possess, and from individuals and relatives have weinherited all that surrounds us of poverty and misery.This is that blessing which Moses conferred on the tribeof Levi, for by reason that it was consecrated to God hadno other inheritance on earth but Him, saying, “Levi ishe who hath said to his father and to his mother, “I do notAnow you, nor have I seen you”; and to his own brethren,“I know you not,” and his very children he has not known.ENTERS THE MONASTIC STATE127These, Lord, are they who have kept Thy word and observed Thy covenant,” an express figure of the religiousand perfect men of the New Testament, who, forgettingall things and leaving all, gave themselves up entirely toGod, and God gave Himself to all of them; and whilethey approached to Him, bound themselves with strongbands and pacts to the service of God.I can never cease to admire the grandeur and majesty ofthe holy tongue which merely with the one word of the nameof Levi expresses all this; and in itself encloses all that inan exact and most finished definition, the philosophers andtheologians of the world (had they been gathered together)could have defined as a state of perfection; because inHebrew the word “Levi" sounds equal to what in ourlanguage we should express by “closely to join in a firmfriendly union,” and be in companionship in every treatyand affair, and be in all things as “one only thing”; theproper business of those who in all truth could say withSt. Peter: “Behold, Lord, we have left all things in orderto follow and cling to Thee.” The word and name of“Levi" springs from one root and verb which signifiesto “put out to interest,” and to lend to advantage andbenefit, and in truth it is so, for he who in this way formsa company with God and leaves all for His sake, places allin a secure guardianship which is so safe that our LordHimself assures him that He will repay an hundredIf such a word pledgedfold.” Oh, infinite goodness!us to an earthly prince, with what haste, and with whateagerness, would we not leave everything and go andBut such is the fragile condition of manserve him?that he sets more credit on the things of the presentlife, and, which generally speaking, deceive and illudehim, rather than confide in the actual Eternal Truth which1 Deuteronomy xxxiii. 8.Matt. xix. 29.128THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEonly demands of him for this exchange faith and hope.This then is Levi, he who blessed Moses, he who, intruth, hoping and believing, places all his treasure in God,and leaves everything, and despoils himself of all things,and clings to and unites himself with God alone, and iffrom this solemn agreement he should separate himself,he would not be “Levi,” but Leviathan which is the nameof the serpent in whose commerce the only profit thatis drawn is perdition, mourning, and weeping for everThis is what the word “Leviathan” signifies; andmore.therefore God has threatened this ancient serpent byIsaias the prophet with the visitation of His sword, hard,great, and strong unto destruction, and it is evident thatthose also shall be included, each according to his guilt,who have designed to form a company with him in hisdeceits and snares.This knife it was which our doctoralluded to when writing to Heliodorus (as we have seen),he told him it were madness to listen to the laments offather and mother, when the sword of our enemy wasuplifted over our head.And so that we may bring these unjust complaints toan end, let us hear what this same Father writes in theEpistle De Vitando suspecto Contubernio” in which, amongother deep and saintly reasons, he says as follows:“Should any one reprehend you, being a Christian (he isaddressing a virgin), that you keep virginity, do not letthis trouble you; and if you should be told that you hadleft your mother to enter a monastery in order to liveamong other virgins, let me tell you that these taunts areyour praise; because, when in the maiden of the Lordthere is no fault found in the delight she seeks after, whichis holiness of life, this is no cruel thing but very greatpiety, because then you do not prefer your own mother,Epist. 47.ENTERS THE MONASTIC STATE129but He who commands you to prefer to her your own souland life.” And it is proper that this should be madeknown to be a holy and pious law, and well observed,not only in the time of our saint but also at the commencement of the Church, and even among the Gentiles previous to the knowledge of the true God, as appears in thecase of the virgins consecrated to the goddess Vesta, whenfrom not keeping their vows miserable falls and misfortuneshappened, and breakings occurred in these holy virginalvases consecrated to God. By which is manifestly seen thatsuch delicate vessels cannot be very safe where they areliable to meet with many encounters, for at the first blowBut let us pass on.they must immediately receive hurt.Our saintly youth at length, fully determined to carry outhis holy purpose, encountered all these trials and contentions with so brave a spirit that he conquered everydifficulty, and, like a valiant soldier, he encouraged othersto follow him and join the militia of Christ. He leftfather, mother, country, brethren, relatives, and all theluxury and delights of this life, and went forth, full of faithand hope, like to another and new Abraham to the placeHe determined to hasten hisGod had shown him.journey and undertake the voyage at once, employing allthe haste he could, because in these first resolves and holybeginnings it is always dangerous to make any delays.I am of opinion, judging by good conjectures, thatJerome was at the time twenty-three or twenty-four yearsof age; a happy commencement of his saintly period ofyouth, and from this time forward he begins to reveal tous very lofty aims.DISCOURSE THE FOURTHOn the first Journey which St. Jerome undertook to the HolyLand. The various Places he visited previous to enteringthe Desert.THE saintly youth left the house of his parents with thespirit of a man who had resolved never again to see itwith his own eyes, and without turning to look back likeone who takes hold of the plough, so as not to renderhimself unworthy of the kingdom which he proposed towin by the sweat of his brow. He left his parents witheyes brimming over with tears, as his own were dry. Hepassed over all tender feelings without being turned inthe slightest degree from his purpose—running to winthe battle which was to give him the victory. And asthough he were quitting the captivity of Babylon and thepower of Pharaoh, and as though he beheld already beforehim the resplendent column which effaced the darkness ofthe night, and the sight of the firstborn of Egypt dead,did he leave the comforts of life and, trusting solely to thevoice of God Who called him, he passes dry-footed the sea,and journeys to the desert to offer himself in sacrifice toHim, and to receive that holy law which by straight pathsshall place him in the Promised Land, and lead him to thatlonged-for Sabbath reserved for the happy times of the130FIRST JOURNEY TO HOLY LANDI31Gospel. With him also departed the aforesaid friends—Heliodorus, Vincentius, Rufinus, and Hylas.I am not able to state as a fact whether from thencehe returned to Rome to gather together his library, orwhether from Istria or Stridon they proceeded to takeship on the Adriatic Sea, though I believe the latter to bethe more probable.After sailing out, whether on account of a stormwhich overtook them in the gulf, or from some otherThisreason, Rufinus withdrew from their company.fact the saintly doctor himself gives us to understand inthe Epistle which he wrote to him at Nitria, a city ofEgypt, where Rufinus was at the time, because havingbeen overtaken by the storm or shipwreck, or it mighthave been on the occasion when the merchants weregoing to Alexandria, he was carried along the wholeof the Mediterranean ocean, passing the Sea of Ausoniaand the Sea of Crete, and took refuge in the port ofAlexandria as the saint tells him in this Epistle in thefollowing words: “After that the furious and suddenwhirlwind which accompanied the storm had wrenched mefrom his side; after that hurried and sad parting hadsevered the bonds of love and charity” by which we wereunited; that very instant, I beheld the heavens and myown head as though enveloped in a black mantle, and inthe storm-tossed ocean that I was engulfed I saw noughtIn a word, in that terrible voyage,else but sea and sky.the vessel was at the mercy of the elements, tossed hereand there, carried along I know not where, but eventuallyto Thrace, and from thence to Pontus and to Bithynia, andafter a lengthy circuit called at Galatia and Cappadocia,and finally passing the burning sands of Cilicia, exhaustedby its heat it became imperative to reach Syria like oneEpist. 41.Virg. Æneid.132THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwho out of a terrible wreck reaches the port.”In thesebrief words the saintly doctor has described his voyage,a lengthy dangerous journey, carried out of his course by along circuitous route, passing many lands and barbarouspeoples. And despite that St. Jerome, through wishingto describe briefly this voyage, does not mention havingpassed Constantinople, I believe, nevertheless, that he didnot omit to call at its port, for it was the best route fromThrace to pass the Sea of Pontus and thence on to Bithyniawhich is the first province of Asia Minor. He passed onsubsequently to Galatia and reached the city of Ancyra,which was the chief town of that province, and it appearshe dwelt there for some days, from what he says in thatmost learned preface to the second book of his Commentaries on the Epistle of St. Paul, Ad Galatas, where heexplains the origin and antiquity of the people of Galatia,and in passing, of many other provinces also (of which wepurpose on some future day to treat). He describes thecondition and customs of divers peoples, he gathers alsoinformation from the Epistles themselves of the Apostlesand from the accounts narrated in the sacred scriptures.Thus of the Romans he says that they are firm in thefaith and have great devotion and piety, furthermore,sincerity in obedience, but he also says of them thatthey are easy-going, proud, and arrogant. Of the Corinthians he describes them as somewhat vain, fond ofpersonal adornment, curling their hair; and that thewomen are bold, going about with uncovered heads andloving admiration, and vainly gloried in the wisdom of theage, going so far as to deny the resurrection of the body.The Macedonians he praises as being charitable andgiven to hospitality, with paternal love, but neverthelessaccuses them of being idle, pleasure-seeking people,frequenting each other's houses through idleness and aFIRST JOURNEY TO HOLY LANDwandering manner, finally he concludes by stating thatthe people of Galatia are barbarian, rude, and allowthemselves to be easily deceived, and the saint adds:“Any one can see that this description of the apostle is amost clear fact, as was proved by such as went with me inthe city of Ancyra, the metropolis of Galatia, because evendown to the present day the city is rent and divided ina thousand ways by the schisms which prevail, and bythe various dogmas and sects which reign there, a lostI leave aside the Cataphrigae,and devastated capital.Ophitae, Barboretae, and Manicheans, for all now knowthe sad origin and history of these unfortunate names andsects.” The words of our saint were 'attested in theCouncil of Ancyra, which was celebrated about the year ofour Lord 508, in which the principal point treated on wasagainst the practice of those who, through fear or violence,sacrificed to idols, or who mixed themselves up with theGentiles in their sacrifices.This Council took placeprevious to the Council of Nicaea, and was not a universalbut a synodal one, and was confirmed in the sixth generalcouncil celebrated in Constantinople. Of the language ofthe people the saint says at the end of the preface that itwas not Greek but the same tongue as was spoken in thecity of Trèves, situated in Germany on the banks of theRhine. Whence it is clearly proved that the Galatianswere people who had come from the north, comprehendedby the general name of Gauls as all others who had comethere to populate it, as we shall have occasion to explainfarther on in our history.From thence our saint journeyed on to Cappadocia.Later on, leaving the direct road which he had hithertofollowed, he turned towards the south and came to Ciliciathrough desert paths, because the land of Cappadocia is veryarid and without rivers, until Mount Tarpeia is reached,THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwhich divides Cappadocia from the province of Cilicia.What constancy! What fervour of the servant of JesusChrist, and what a yearning to find Him does he notBy crossingmanifest by all this arduous undertaking?lands and waters, this traversing of mountains, rivers,deserts, towns, this meeting of strange nations and barbarous races by a youth rich and brought up in all the luxuryof wealth and position, yet leaving father, mother, andbrethren, breaks all bonds and undertakes hard trials andpilgrimages in order to reach that land and tread the veryearth which the Son of God had consecrated by His footsteps, seeking Him amid those loving relics and amid theactual traces of His precious blood which are left to us.The long peregrinations of Abraham and of Jacob withright good reason were celebrated in the divine Scriptures,yet not so much on account of the great difficultiesencountered, nor by reason of the enormous distancetraversed by these holy patriarchs as for the deep mysteryand sacrament which they enclosed and typified.Thisbeing, as it were, the first proof of that faith and obediencewhich we owe to God and to His promises; but if wecompare these journeyings with those of our glorious father,they are small and of lesser difficulty, and the fervour oflove divine which burned in his breast, the devotion andthe desire, I dare to say was not less than in respect to thefirst, because to my mind it is no lesser thing for God tocreate in His Church a father and a doctor than to raise apatriarch for the faith in the synagogue of the ancientpeople.I leave aside the advantage which the saints ofthe New Testament enjoy above those of the old law, andthe greater abundance of grace, of gifts and riches of thosewhom Isaias and St. Paul declare, that “neither eye hathseen nor ear heard, nor hath it entered in the breast ofman to conceive what things God has prepared for thoseFIRST JOURNEY TO HOLY LANDI35who follow Him,” which is understood not only as regardsthe future life, but of the present golden age of theNew Testament, which is what our divine Lord impliedon other occasions, when He gave us to understandthe grandeur of this glorious state: “Oh how manykings and prophets have desired to see the things that yousee and have not seen them, and to hear the things thatyou hear and have not heard them | " Yet even shouldwe put aside this consideration, which is so manifest, howmuch greater are the saints of the New Testament thanthose of the Old, looking at them thus point by point, andcomparing the things of our saint with those of the holyfathers, for his peregrinations, his faith, his great charity,his ardent desires are not in a single point less than weretheirs.It may appear to such as judge superficially thatthis journey was an affair of small account; but to me whohave experienced what these peregrinations are in reality,and what itis to pass across peoples and kingdoms,tongues, and barbarian nations, incredulous and furious, willperceive what great ardour, what courage and strong determination in the service of God are needed to overcomeso many difficulties as are met with.At length the holy man came to Cilicia, and with thelove of the Apostle St. Paul he tarried some days in theprovince, principally in the city of Tarsus, the native placeof that “clear trumpet of the Holy Ghost”; and as he wasso prudent and observant in all he did, urged by the desireof improving himself on every occasion, he took advantageof his sojourn there to acquire the idiom of the province,the correct mode and phrases of speech, as is clearly manifested in the Epistle which he wrote to Algasia, where, inthe 10th question, among other things he says as follows:"“That which we have often said, that which the ApostleEpist. 151.136THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMESt. Paul declares, albeit not very erudite in the wording,but very much so in wisdom, and which he spoke notthrough humility, but because he in truth felt it so, now, Imyself affirm and approve.Because these deep thoughtsof his could not be explained by the tongue; and feelingthe good and comprehending what he says that he couldnot put them in such exactitude of expression or proprietyof words to suit the ears of his hearers.In the Hebrewlanguage (for after all as a Hebrew himself, and broughtup at the feet of Gamaliel, a most learned man), he waswell skilled, but as regards Greek, when he wished todeclare himself in that language, he is rather obscure.And if this occurs in the Greek to one who was born inTarsus of Cilicia, and who studied the language in his earlyyears, what shall we say of the Latins, who fatigue themselves translating his sentences word by word only that theymay leave them more obscure, similarly to the weeds which,growing up, choke the fertility of the crops?Farther onhe adds: “Many words occur in the apostle's writings whichare in use in the dialect of his province and of his city.”He then proceeds to quote some passages, as examples, inhis Epistle, which we leave aside as unnecessary to thepurpose of our work, which is to make manifest the diligence of the saint, and therefore what has been said suffices.From all this is seen his great diligence, by whichthe Church later on so greatly profited, and also provesthat these journeyings and peregrinations were not undertaken (as in the case of others) for amusement sake; butwere of such importance and advantage and usefulnessthat it is manifest that in all things God was leading himby the hand, and as though training and exercising him,in order that later on he should yield glorious results forthe benefit of His Church.1 2 Corinth. xi. 6.FIRST JOURNEY TO HOLY LAND137From Tarsus he passed on to Antioch, again traversingMount Taurus. He remained some time in that city, wherehe established a friendship with the learned and saintlypriest Evagrius, as appears in the Epistle he wrote to hisfriend Florentius. And while he lingered here he ponderedon what spot and place he should retire to so as to carryout his purpose of leading the life of a monk and asolitary — in what desert, and who should be his companions, what conveniences he should adopt as best forIt so happened, as I gatherhis aim and purpose of life.from the Epistle which I shall later on quote, that eitherfrom the desert of Syria, which is not far distant fromAntioch, there came some servants of God to this city, orelse that the holy man himself went there (which seems tome more probable), and held a conference with them,among others being one called Theodosius.He communicated to them his purpose and determination howgreatly he desired to follow that rule, and the vow he hadmade, and the longings he had to undertake at once thislife. Who can doubt that they encouraged him in thisenterprise, inflaming his heart with the wings of desireto fly to that desired nest and greatly-sought-for rest?But whereas to the inferior part of the soul there wererepresented to him so vivid and difficult an encounter, and .the issue of the battle so doubtful, foreseeing as he did thetrials which were set before him in that desert, he refusedthe contest. And there would be depicted to him such greatand overwhelming difficulties, similarly as had happenedto the cowardly explorers of the sons of Israel, in viewof the inhabitants of the land of promise, who becameterrified at the bravery and stature of those armed menof Canaan and the Philistines, despite he had within hisbreast the valour of a Joshua and of the brave Caleb (theone means salvation and the other brave heart, like to a138THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMElion); yet he would not trust to his own powers, but in thepower of God, and thus he was minded to write a letter tothose saintly anchorites, full of loving desires, of profoundsentiments of humility and divine confidence, and addressedit to the holy monk Theodosius, in which he expresseshimself in this wise: “Oh, how I long to find myself inyour holy congregation and admirable company | Andalthough these eyes of mine be not worthy to behold this,I will nevertheless embrace this life with all joy and conI will gaze on that desert with more delighttentment.than on the most beautiful of cities, and contemplate thoseplaces bereft of inhabitants, but wherein are gatheredButtogether, as in a paradise, these companies of saints.as my sins are no doubt the reason whereby I may notbe allowed to be a participator or enjoy such holy company,I beseech of you that by means of your holy prayers (as Idoubt not you will be able to obtain it), I may be rescuedfrom the darkness of the age.In regard to what in yourpresence I had stated already, and in the desire which Icease not now to declare to you by letters, my soul andmy desires are resolved upon to carry out.It nowdevolves on yourselves that the will should be followed byMine indeed is the wish; but that I shouldthe effect.carry out what I desire must be left to your prayers.Iam nothing else but a weak, infirm sheep, which has strayedfrom the fold, and if the Good Shepherd does not receiveme and carry me on His shoulders to return me to thesheep-fold I must remain in the pitfall, and the more Imay try to rise all the more my feet will slip and I shallI am that prodigal son who hasgo down the lower.wasted the goods and the portion which my Father gaveme.I have not yet returned to cast myself at His feet,nor have I shaken off the remembrance of an easy life, andthe sensuality of my early days; and by what it appears IFIRST JOURNEY TO HOLY LANDI39have not withdrawn myself from the vices, but only seemto wish to do so.Hence the enemy strives to bind medown with fresh cords, ever bringing forward new impediments, and labours to surround me as by a sea of difficultiesand confusions in order that on every side I should beencircled by the waves, while I, thus placed in the centreof this element, can neither turn back nor take a step forward. Thus it only remains to me, that by means of yourprayers to awaken in me the breath of the Holy Spirit, sothat I may bestir myself and move on with efficacy until Itouch the port and desired shore.”From this letter can be seen what were the burningflames which were shooting from the heart of this saintlyyouth, and from the last words is perceived when he statesthat he cannot turn back, that he had made a vow tobecome a monk. And we also discover what diligence thedevil must have employed to prevent him from carryingout his saintly purposes.Nor was St. Jerome idle duringhis stay at Antioch whilst awaiting the decision to departfor the desert, and finish stripping himself of all the impediments which still kept him rooted to the world.Heoccupies himself in holy study, and ventured to try his penand genius on a Commentary of the sacred scriptures,selecting for his subject the prophet Obadiah. And whereashe had acquired the style of the Greek writers, and allrespecting Origen pleased him, for he was the father ofallegorical and mystical manner of speech, whom mostof the current writers of that time imitated, he likewisefollowed his style.This, however, he greatly deploredhaving done, as we shall see farther on, and called itignorance and boyish silliness.In order that we should see how well he describesthis, and what he thinks of this manner of expoundingthe sacred letters, forasmuch as he possessed a veryI40THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEexcellent doctrine for restraining bold minds who, as soonas they learn a few letters, and even without so much aslearning them, at once attempt to touch the sacredscriptures, and in place of expounding and illustrating,rather darken and debase them by their Commentaries,I wish to quote here some passages from his Proem onObadiah, which he sent to his friend Pammachius, and whichoccur at the commencement. “When I was little,” he says,“I spoke like a child, I knew things as a boy and thoughtlike a boy; and now that I am a man I put aside all thatwas boyish.Hence if the Apostle goes on improving,and day by day forgetting the past, stretches forthforward, and, according to the precept of the Saviour,placing his hand on the plough does not stop toturn back, how much more must I who have not yetattained man's perfect state, nor have ‘come to themeasure of the age of Christ, deserve pardon, if, urged onby the ardour and desires of the sacred letters, I in myyouth dared totheprophet Obadiah, of whose words I neither in those daysunderstood the letter nor the historic sense ? My soulwas burning with the pleasure of the spiritual understanding, and, because I had read that all things are possibleto him who believes, I did not observe how varied arethe impulses and gifts of the Holy Ghost.I had aknowledge of human letters, and so I thought that Icould read the sealed book.”explain, in an allegoricalsense,Farther on he adds: “I had thought that what I hadwritten was packed away in my presses, and that what mygenius had with temerity dared to do I had consigned tothe fire; but when least I bethought it there came ayouth from Italy with the actual original which I hadwritten so many years back. He praised very much thelittle work, and I confess I greatly marvelled, seeing thatFIRST JOURNEY TO HOLY LANDI4 Ihowever foolish one may write there is never wantingone of the same humour to read it. He praised the littlework to the skies while I bent down my head in astonishment. He set little less than in heaven its mystic sense,and I cast my eyes to the ground in shame at my interPerchance, think you, albeit I may say this,pretation.No,I condemn those exercises of my youth ?thatundoubtedly not. We know that in the Tabernacle ofthe Lord by the side of gold there was also offered thehair of goats; and in the Gospel we read that the twolittle coins of the poor widow were more acceptablethan the large offerings of the rich ! We gave in thosedays what we had, and now if we have profited somewhat we will likewise return it to the same owner,because by the grace of God I am what I am, for I donot deny that for thirty years I have worked in this holyexercise and labour.” He afterwards adds : “This was inthe time when my Pammachius, more loved than the light,my dear Heliodorus and myself were together engaged intrying to be inhabitants of the burnt-up desert of Syria.What I had judged secret has been made public.I willtherefore return to examine the old footprints, and amendthe badly-formed strokes of my letters.Iknew not how to write, my hand shook, and I did notproperly set my fingers.However, even should I nothave derived advantage in aught else, I at least can saytruly what Socrates learnt—“I know that I do not know.”I was a child.Thus do we behold how this saintly youth spent histime, and the journey he had made. Now we have himon the point of running a match with the old and commonenemy; because of the three enemies we may well saythat as regards the two, viz., the world and the flesh, hehas treated them badly, for the one he has dragged to theBecauseground and the other he has severely punished.I42THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEfor a youth who has been delicately nurtured, rich, noble,prudent, learned, beloved of his parents, and esteemed byhis relatives, to fling all down under his feet, forgettingand despoiling himself so completely of all things, in orderearnestly to embrace the cross of Christ, and seek thescience which disillusions and does not puff up, is in truthto have done much, for to commence so well is to havealready more than done half the work.DISCOURSE THE FIFTHSt. Jerome goes to dwell in the Desert.What manner ofLife he led there.The great Penances he performed.in aIN that region of Asia which is called Syria, and, accordingto others, Asisia, but now generally called Suria, there is aprovince, one of the many into which it is divided, whichgoes by the name of Syria-Coele, so called because it ishalf - crooked circle between the twosituatedmountains of Libanus and Antilibanus, and which isIt is also divided into smallcalled by Pliny Decapolis.districts; in one of these, called Chalcidice, is a veryfertile region, a habitable land, and enjoys a very equableclimate, neither in winter is the cold very great nor inthe summer is the heat excessive. Towards the easternpart of this province there is an extensive rugged desertnot habitable for men, being the proper dwelling of wildbeasts and of serpents, which infest and abound there inlimit andgreatboundaries between Palestine and Syria-Coele. To thiswild region did the brave servants of Jesus Christ fixtheir abode, called and led thither by the secret impulseof the Holy Spirit, without fearing it, but rather to thecontrary, fleeing from the pomp, vanity, and the pleasuresand comforts of the world, and take refuge in this retiredThis desert marks thenumbers.Strabo, Pliny, Mela.143I44THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEsanctuary, considering less dangerous the companionshipof asps than the company of men.Many servants of God dwelt there, in some little cellsor huts, but at considerable distance from each other, andspread about that desert, fearless of danger, withou.apprehension, forgetful of the world, and attending sole.yto the salvation of their souls; a source of edification andjoy to the blessed in heaven, scorning the vanity of thechildren of Adam, and weeping over the follies of sinners.Among these holy anchorites of the desert was thatvenerable Theodosius, to whom reference has been made, towhom he had addressed his letter; and to him he oftentimesgave an account of his designs. Jerome tore himself awaywith his companions Heliodorus, Innocentius, and Hylas,severed all bonds which were inconvenient, and withresolute spirit proceeded to this roughest of deserts tomake themselves new inhabitants of it, and to becomethe companions of the wild beasts, while their soulsenjoyed the fellowship of angels!From hence we commence to look upon a new man, amost novel course for a future doctor of the Church toadopt, and we shall depict the life of a singular anchorite;and therefore I have somewhat to alter the line of proceeding in this history, because up to this stage, in all thatI have recounted of his affairs, I have contented myselfwith referring simply to his words, in order to make clearand verify what I have said. Now in this part I do not wishto continue this course, but taking his words and what ofhimself he briefly recounts as my text, and, as it were, thefoundation, I will make such observations upon them as Ishall deem proper. And whereas in this part there aremany noteworthy things which it would be grievous tocrowd together in one discourse, I will divide them inorder, according to their kind.LIFE IN THE DESERTI45In the first place, I will treat here on the order of hisSecondly, I will declare the strongcontests andlife and his exercises.temptations which he suffered, and thewrestlings he had with the devil.With reference to the first, the holy doctor himselftells us many things in divers places in his works; andin the renowned Epistle which he wrote to the virginEustochium on Virginity, desirous of instructing her as tothe care she should have in rejecting the thoughts withwhich in the spiritual life the devil always endeavours toassail the soul with great force in order to prevent anyadvantage being gained, and also to frighten beginners, heexpresses himself in this wise—and as these words are avery apposite doctrine I quote them: “I do not wishyou to allow your thoughts to assume proportions. Donot allow any one thing of Babylon to gain the masteryover you. As regards the enemy, where he shows himselfof small account you must cut him down; you must deprivehim of the malice of his tares to prevent their growth, andin the seed he must be stamped out and slain.Listenhow the Psalmist expresses it: “Daughter of Babylon |you hapless one !Blessed is he who should repay youfor what you gave us, and treat you as you treated us.Blessed is he who should take your little ones and dashthem against the stone.’”*I do not wish here to make anyother observation, but beseech such as in good earnest havecommenced to take the journey onwards, and who assumeto have left the wide road along which so many walk tothe loss of their souls, in order to enter the door andnarrow path of life, to take this counsel of St. Jerome verymuch to heart, and by continual diligence examine theirthoughts, and keep watch lest, if they allow themselves tobe carried away by them, and as though asleep they doEpist. 21.L146THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEnot watch what is passing within, that which in the beginning was small, imperfect, and as though of little strengthlike to a babe, in a very short time will grow to be a giantin power—then assumes the mastery, takes undividedpossession, and so thoroughly becomes united to the soulthat it cannot be borne, and brings forth offspring ofFrom which results that in orderperdition and of death.to wrest the prize from the hands of the evil one no onehuman created weapon suffices, but only can it be done bythe powerful hand of God.” In this advice is comprehendednothing less than the loss or gain of the blessed life; forwhich reason does the Psalmist say: “Blessed will be hewho shall dash to death her little ones,” and the Hebrewword which is here interpreted blessed is in the text expressed in the plural in this wise—blessings on him whoshall thus act, because glory is a good enclosing manygoods together, and all depends upon the beginning,which at first sight is as small as is the rejection andresistance offered and made against a small thought. Thesaint did not say, neither as a matter of fact does thePsalmist say, prevent them, because that is not at presentin our hand to do; and thus the saint at once follows, saying in his Epistle, “It is impossible that in the thoughtand sense it should not touch the native heat of the veinsand of the sensitive part; but he shall be praised andstyled blessed who, as soon as the smallest thought presentsitself of this, at that very instant he cuts off the head ofthe evil thought, and breaks it on the stone, and the stoneis Christ.”So that the virgin Eustochium should have an illustration of this doctrine put to the test, the saint himselfaffords her his own example, humbly confessing all thathe had suffered and experienced in himself, in these words:“Oh, how often, when living in the desert, in that exLIFE IN THE DESERTI47tensive solitude, which, dried up by the burning rays of thesun, offered a frightful dwelling-place to the monks, itseemed to me that I was in the midst of the pleasures ofRome.”Here in these brief words the saint has revealed to ushis abode, bereft of all the comforts which are needed forthe miserable life of man | The ground dry and burnt up,without a vestige of verdure, no plants, no trees to afford ashade from the noonday heat. There were no toweringcedars, no luxuriant palms, nor stately trees affording fruit,pleasing the eye by their beauty, no running waters, norefreshing streams to cool the air and afford a soothingmurmur to the ear, no kind of rest or refreshment,-in aI mean menword, a desert very much deserted of men.whose desires go no farther than the earth, yet as such evendo not seek so unfertile a land.Here, indeed, did this greatman fix his dwelling-place, he who pretends to no onething of earth.Here did that divine youth imprison himself of his own free will, and here did that clear light ofthe Church bury the best and most flourishing days of hislife, fully resolved upon spending it all here, had Heavennot designed otherwise, and brought him forth for thegood of the world to be its great and most brilliant beaconNevertheless, we might well say that althoughof light.the body was as a fact in so rough a place, yet the soulwas in the enjoyment of supreme delight!Oh, divinemercy of the Lord! With what skill and care dost Thouchisel the life of the saints | What colours and what shadesdost Thou impart to them!

Whocan doubt that in a soul so full of good intentions, sofull of fervent desires, and practising such vigorouspenance, that he must have carefully watched over his148THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthoughts, and must have kept vigilance such as we havesignified above PFor he adds and declares that despitethat he dwells in a spot so far removed from every comfortand pleasure, yet oftentimes did there rise before his eyesthe delights and satisfactions found in the society of Rome!What a lively diligence must the enemy have exercised inthis warfare ! What haste did he not employ to arouse inthe saint all the species of his fantasy, and represent vividlyto him in that hidden spot what in other days he hadHence, he farther onwitnessed in the world of gaiety |affirms that his soul and his heart were full of sadness andbitterness! “I walked about,” he says, “and lived alone,withdrawn from all, because I was full of bitterness. Mylimbs were cold, fleshless, stark dry with the hair shirt andthe rough habit. My skin was coarse, blackened from theburning rays of the sun, turned into an Ethiopian. Myeyes continually flooded with tears, for I sighed andsobbed without ceasing.If at times I was overcome bysleep—against which I offered constant resistance—mybed was the bare ground, and my weary bones and limbswere racked.”Here he has manifested to us his dress,and revealed to us what his bed was. He has graphicallydescribed it all to us, and well indeed was his miserablebody brought down to the dust.Yet how easily does herecount it all ! and how difficult is all this to be carried out!How light all this appears written down, or read about inthe person of a third individual, yet how almost insupportable does it all become when put into practice.I do not say this as regards the very fact, which isgreat and extraordinary, and little less than unapproachable, but it is true even of other and lesser acts, lighterand easier to bear, which if we but attempt to practisethem for the space of a month, or even for a week, itappears to us that we can compare them to the greatestLIFE IN THE DESERT149and the heaviest of mortifications, and have no fear, andnot even shame to class them among rough and penitentialacts. To our saint, on the contrary, all seems to him little.He himself deems that he does nothing, and is worthnothing—this being proper of such as perform great thingsand of great worth.Greatly does it come to the purpose in respect to therevelation of our great penitent that about living solitary,of being clothed in haircloth, and of sleeping on theground and in the dust—those words of the prophetJeremias in his Lamentations: “It is good for a manwhen he hath borne the yoke from his youth. He shallsit solitary and hold his peace, because he shall take itupon himself. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if soIt seems as though the prophetbe there may be hope.”vividly depicts him.Let us see how our own doctordeclares it himself, for there is no need to seek far intothe Commentary. “The perfection of a soldier of Christ,”he says, “is to have his soul despoiled of all affairs of theAccording to whatworld and of the turmoil of the age.the Apostle tells us, No one who stands beneath the standardof God entangles himself in the things of the age (and whatelse he adds); rather he endeavours, as far as humanweakness permits him, to unite himself with Christ in alldiligence.“This rule of life, and this manner of procedure, mustbe the endeavour of all good monks to imitate, who byvow have bound themselves to the monastic life.Butthis mercy of God and this gift of perfection is rarelygiven, and only to the few; because that man is truly inevery part perfect who, whether he be in the desert, or inthe strictness and hardship of solitude, or in the monastery,endures with even spirit the weaknesses of his brethren.1 Lament. Jeremias, iii. 27, 28, 29.15oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEHence it is a difficult matter to find any one who in bothprofessions is perfect, because neither can the solitary soeasily attain the perfect contempt of all material things,nor he who lives the common life the purity of contemplation. What advantage, nevertheless, exists in the rigourof the solitary calm life to that of the busy bustle of theFartherage is well known to such as have experienced it.”on, after commenting on the advantage of the contemplativelife over the active one, he adds: “Here he puts his mouthin the dust, he who, feeling himself lowly, is fully awarethat he is weak, and that, like a thing that is made of dust,confesses that he has to return to dust, saying with thepatriarch Abraham: I will speak with my God and Lord,whereas I am but dust and ashes.” Then a little farther hesays: “To the reprobate and perverse city our LordHimself in the gospel declared that had Tyre and Sidonwitnessed and seen performed the things that had beendone in her, without doubt they would have done penancein ashes and haircloth. By the haircloth is signified thesharpness of sorrow for sin, in ashes the dust of the dead.In penance both are joined, because by the pricking of thehair-shirt we should be made aware of what by sinning wehave committed, and in the embers of the ashes we shouldcontemplate what we come to by sin.Let us thereforeponder, and witness in the hair-shirt the prickings of thevices, and in the dying embers of the ashes of deathlet us meditate on the just punishments due to ourfaults.And forasmuch as after the sin there followedup the ignominious things of the flesh, let man beholdin the roughness of hair-shirt what he had committed byhis haughty pride, and let him see in the ashes to whatan extreme depth of misery he had fallen by sinning.Another signification may also be applied, viz., in thehair-shirt we see repentance, reprehension, and the sorrowLIFE IN THE DESERT151of contrition, according to what Job said: “I myselfreprehend my own self, for it is nothing less than a sharppricking of the hair-shirt that which passes within my soul,rubbing itself with the sharpness of the feeling; and inashes he does penance, because with wide-open vision heobserved what had followed from the sentence passed onthe first crime; and he cries out, I do penance on embersand ashes, which in truth is to say clearly I do not puffmyself with pride for any gift which I may have receivedfrom my Maker, because, having been made of dust throughthe penalty I incurred, I find myself returning into thatvery dust again.”All this is of the saint, and these thoughts were thoseThese,which clad him in the haircloth he speaks of here.and other similar things which he had in his heart, werethose which placed him in so rough an abode, whichrendered his limbs fleshless, and that his emaciated bodyshould have no other rest but that afforded him by a bedon the hard, bare ground.It is thus that refined penanceis performed; it is thus that God is served; in this waydo those act who are to be qualified to become such greatsaints as Jerome; in this way are brought up and traineddoctors of the Church, and in this way are worked thesamplers of Christian perfection. Now after having seenwhat his couch, apparel, dwelling, and the exercise of hislife were, let us see what his food was.Farther on hesays in the same Epistle: “Of the food and drink I willkeep silence, forasmuch as the invalid monks drink naughtbut cold water, and it is held a luxury to eat anythingcooked.”And therefore, O glorious father, you did not wish totell us what your food was ? You did well, because itwould either frighten us or it would be incredible ! Thenote suffices for us, and the rhetorical insinuation tells us152THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEenough.what about the strong and those considered robust?If the sick and the weak lived in this manner,A marvellous thing! above human strength, andimpossible of imitation, save by the especial assistanceof heaven |In this Epistle” the same doctor tells us he had seenthree orders of monks in Egypt, some who in theirlanguage were called Sauses, and in the Latin Cenobitae,and in the vernacular men who live in community.Otherswere called Anachoretes, deriving their name from theflight, and withdrawing from the conversation of men,and living about in the deserts. The third were calledRembotes, the lowest grade of monks. These lived in citiesand towns, a few here and there, two or three together,as they listed. They did manual labour for their support,and even for profit; and, as though the art or trade pursued were in itself holy, and not the life itself, it was tobe done for a greater price and be of more value thanwhat others sold.Putting these aside, the same doctorsays, “Let us speak of the Cenobitae who live in common.”He describes their life and holy custom, their obedience,humility, charity, and brotherly love which they had onetowards the other; and although they led a rough life,yet when they were ill, he says, they were moved intoanother larger cell, where they would be so cared for andpetted by the elder monks that they neither missed thecomforts of the city nor the blandishments of theirmothers.According to this description, a far stricterlife was followed by the monks of the desert of Chalcisthan by the Egyptians, for even in sickness they werenot permitted to eat anything cooked.In the life of St. Paul, the first hermit, our doctorrecounts that here in this very desert where he abodeEpist. 22, cap. 15.LIFE IN THE DESERT153there were found monks practising admirable abstinence;among others he says he saw two, one who had passedthirty years in a small cell without eating but a littlebarley bread and drinking a little muddy water, and theother lived inside an old cistern, eating during the wholeday but five figs.This, says the saint, will appearimpossible to those of little faith, who do not attain tograsp the fact that there is nothing impossible to believers.From this I infer that, as our monk will not tell uswhat his food and drink was, it must have been somethingsimilar to what he describes, but that he did not wish tofrighten the virgin Eustochium, a dainty, wealthy maidenat the time, or else so that it should not appear as thoughhe were attempting to vaunt his sanctity and abstinence,and passes it over in silence, only telling us in a roundabout way by stating that even the invalid and the weakdid not touch food that was cooked, and considered amongthem as luxury.Under what class are we to rate ourdaintiness? With what courage or face shall we dare tocall ourselves his children, who are so far removed fromthis great abstainer? And how classify the gluttony ofthe fine things of the world when, not content with whatis good and reasonable, men strive to force the appetite totake the costly banquets which gluttony invents?Nevertheless, Jerome was not brought up less daintilythan the daintiest of the world, nor can we say that thenature of his birth impelled him, because he himselfcondemns this as being vicious, and declares that itsinhabitants made a god of their bellies.It was thestrong resolution to work penance that spurred him on,and will do so in regard to all such who embrace it in thespirit of a Jerome.Now that we have seen something of the outward andbodily macerations, let us pass on to view the things of154THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe interior life. He says, farther on in the same Epistle:“But I, who through the fear of hell had condemnedmyself to such a prison, making myself a companion ofscorpions and of wild beasts, nevertheless often did itseem to me that I was in the midst of balls and in thesociety of maidens. The pale countenance induced bylong fastings, the cold body, and the flesh as it were dead,would seem to flush up with burning desires.” Oh, whata holy confession this of Jerome's, rising from a heartFor without duplicity he publishes hisperfectly humble !weakness and reveals his misery !For if we consider thecase well we shall find that the temptation was moststrong and the encounter with the devil very terrible;and it was by special divine permission that the leavewhich in the case of Job was not granted to the enemy,should, in regard to Jerome, be allowed him.God said to the Adversary that He should permit himto try Job with any trials he might wish; deprive him ofhis property and of his children; allow him to be affrontedby his own wife and scorned by her; his friends to makewar to him and contradict him; to wound him withgrievous sores from head to foot, but that he should notI am well aware that many, followingtouch his soul.Olympiodorus, declare of this passage that it is interpretedor understood by soul to be the life, and that God did notforbid the enemy in this act anything else but that heshould not kill him, and the Hebrew word seems to favourthis interpretation; nevertheless the exposition of Didymusis very good, as it explains that the prohibition of nottouching his soul implied that he should not be able toset before him illusions or phantoms, nor impure or foulimaginations.This is a class of very powerful temptations, which to overcome with perfection was reserved forthe law of grace, after the coming of Jesus Christ, and ofLIFE IN THE DESERTI55the descent of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of men, andhence the Lord Himself told the Jews that not one ofthem kept the law which had been given them by Moses,of which David sang in the Psalm xviii., “Who can understand sins 2From my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord, andA shall be cleansed from the greatest sin,” understanding bythe greatest sin that which the apostle calls body of sin,because it includes all, and is like to a poisoned spring,which, as soon as the imagination touches it with thefoul object of covetousness and concupiscence, it at oncebubbles up, conceives and brings forth sin, and behind itthe death of the soul; and forasmuch as the devil ispowerful for stirring up these species conceived by thesenses (if permission be given), and represents them tothe soul, where virtue is weak, he easily wins the victory,because in the kingdom of death he is king.And whereas all this has its beginning in the soul,whilst it exercises the office of animating the inferior partby giving it life (which in Hebrew is called nephes), it caneasily be understood that when God forbade Satan totouch the soul of Job, it was that he should neither takehis life nor set imaginations in the sensitive part. Whathaste he made to exercise St. Jerome in the other temptation with which he afflicted holy Job, we shall see as wego on. To weary with various illusions, foul representations, impure memories the holy soul of our courageousand strong monk, is what he here reveals to us, in allwhich he exceeded holy Job.If the remedies he employedhave been good up to this, and which he has made knownto us, let those speak who have had some experience ofsimilar maladies and of their cures.But the enemy wasso strong and so constant in the battles, and in theassaults he gave the soul so importunate, that they didnot suffice, and then, as a last resource, he acted as he156THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEdescribes to us in these words: “Thus finding myselfabandoned by all relief, I would cast myself at the feetof Jesus, and, bathing them with my tears, would wipethem with my hair, and my rebellious flesh I tamed downby fasts of whole weeks' duration.”Two remedies has the holy penitent declared here,both of great efficacy; with the one Magdalen deliveredherself of seven devils, which is the same as to say ofmany vices, and from the celestial feet of the Master shecame forth whiter than the snow, according to what Davidsings, for those who are washed by so good a hand exceedin whiteness the snow. The other is fasting. He wellmanifests the reason for his silence as to what his foodwas, as we have seen above, because fasts which areprolonged for weeks together do not appear to belongto the life of men, but are proper only of angels; and itis by means of these that not only the servants of God,but even great sinners have attained signal victories overtheir enemies. Upon the verse of Psalm cviii., “My fleshis changed for oil,” the holy doctor says: “When we fast,when our faces turn yellow, when we appear unsightly,let us be persuaded in ourselves that then we appear mostbeautiful to Christ.Soldiers who fast are those He desiresand loves; let our support and provision be the fast itself.Because in it is victory, and in victoryAnd why so?triumph !”Notwithstanding all this, God did not wishthat it should be of avail to Jerome, nor that with themshould cease the force of the combat, in order that itshould be his valour, because itis to brave men thatGod assigns more audacious undertakings, since to themHe will give larger crowns; hence it is imperative thatthey should practise and add above the common andordinary acts of virtue other higher exercises.Caro mea immutata est propter oleum.LIFE IN THE DESERT157Then he adds: “I am not ashamed in confessing themisery of my lot; rather do I weep because I am not nowwhat I was formerly.I call to mind how oftentimes, whencalling and praying to Heaven, I joined day with night,and did not cease to strike my breast until, by commandof the Lord, my soul would be calmed.”After the roughhabit, after sleeping on the ground and racking his drybones, after the fasts of many weeks, after the abundanceof tears shed at the feet of Christ, there followed, in theexercises of our saint, such lofty prayer, so constant andfervent, that it equalled the course of the sun with that ofthe stars, persevering in this prayer night and day, inorder that the whole of the heavens and planets shouldbe the witnesses of such unusual virtue.This is whatSt. Athanasius dwells upon so urgently, and with reason, inthe life of St. Anthony, when in the evening he placedhimself in prayer, his back turned to the west, and hepersevered thus until the sun, rising in the east, cast itsrays on his eyes; meanwhile that the saint himself wouldfeelingly complain of the swiftness of the sun's coursebecause it disturbed the sweet slumber in which heenjoyed God in so lofty a meditation.The very same experience does our saint declare hehad, for oftentimes did he join day to night. And whocan tell, if God, complying some time or another to thepleadings of such men as these, may not have detainedthe course of the sun, so that it should not disturb themwith its rays, meanwhile that they overcame their enemiesand gained the victory in so high a combat as is done inprayer, since there is no one thing which can so breakdown the force of the adversary as by prayer? And thisservant of God well knew what an efficacious remedyprayer is for all our evils, and, as such, he employed it asThis was the principal businesshis continual exercise.158THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEof his life, his sustenance, his food, and in it there is nosolitude, no desert—the whole life spent in it is a paradise.This is the defensive and the offensive weapon; with itare resisted every encounter, and with it is the enemywounded, and the soul is cured of all pains, and comesforth out of all its difficulties, as is briefly declared by the“Neversame Father when writing to the widow Salvinia.let the holy lesson drop from your hands, and let prayerbe always so continued that all the shafts of the thoughtsby which youth is generally combated be resisted withthis shield.” And so that prayer be not alone, he tells usit was accompanied by fasting, which are two wings withwhich the soul flies. These two assist one another sopowerfully that there is no class of demons, howeverpertinacious and obstinate, which cannot be cast out bythem, according to the doctrine of the Saviour, by themouth of St. Matthew.” To this he also joined thechastisement of the body and the striking of the breastwith a stone, imitating the Publican, who, although heshamefacedly called with these knocks at the doors of divinemercy from afar, yet was heard from the distance soonerthan the Pharisee, who was close by. With the pains ofhis bodily wounds he startled away the softness and thedelight of the evil thought,which, rising from thesensitive part to the rational, was, like a bad serpentstruck on the head by the stone, and fell to the ground,and, as the Psalmist said, broke the little ones of Babylonby dashing them on the rock, and, by dint of these blows,introduced Christ into his heart, and at His incoming castout all cares and thoughts of this world.Hence, with right good reason the man who ponderson this cannot but perceive that this saint has been set asa sampler before the eyes of all the faithful, and as aEpist. 9.Matth. xxvii.LIFE IN THE DESERTI59living example, his picture and image, nude and in thedesert, striking his breast with the stone, is reproducedand presented to us oftener than that of any other saint.Because, as he says in the Epistle which I have justquoted, the breast is the root and spring of all our evilthoughts, and there is the seat of the heart whence areconceived, according as our Lord teaches us, the evilswhich render us abhorrent in His presence. And thesaint goes farther in his description, discovering thingsof his exercises and life, and concludes summing up inadmirable and extraordinary words: “My littlecell, asthough it were something that knew my thoughts, Iactually dreaded, and thus I was with myself angry andstern, and I would go out alone and wander far into thedeserts, until I would find some deep valley, some roughwood or broken cliff, and there I remained, making it myplace of prayer and the wretched dwelling for my body.I set God as my witness, that after many tears, afterkeeping my eyes fixed on Heaven for a great while, thenit would seem to me that I found myself in the midst ofthe choir of angels, and then, full of joy and delight, Iwould sing: ‘I will run after Thee to the odour of Thyointments.’” A happy ending and a blessed finish to thetears, the prayers, and the fastings is this which Jeromehere reveals to us. O Most Blessed Lord, how welldost Thou repay, not only in the future glory, which ishoped for, but even here below, at once, what is sufferedfor Thee, and what is done for TheeHow well dostThou fulfil Thy word, that he who should cleanse hisheart will see all that he may desire, which is Thou,Thyself even in this life, according to what Thou hastpromised also by Thy prophet, and didst repeat by Thyapostle, that neither eye hath seen nor ear heard, nor hastEpist. 9.16oTHE LIFE OF ST.

Fromthis arose the custom that when a lad shaved for the first163164THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe manly toga.time it was a token that he passed into his youth, andthis occasion was celebrated among the ancients as a dayof rejoicing, and sacrifices were offered to the Goddess ofYouth, and the toga, which they called pretexta, waschanged intothe sacredScriptures, whenever the loss of all that is best andfinest among the people is bewailed, it is declared underthe metaphor of the young men of the city, fallen, dead,or sold, but not wept for, as appears in Isaias, Jeremias,and other prophets, because, when that which is moststrong perishes, there remains nothing else of esteem.And inThey also simulated that the goddess Youth servedand gave the nectar to the other gods, and was to be likethe cup-bearer of that which, by excellence of beauty, wassolely served by Ganimedes to Jupiter, for in their theologyall this has its mystery.To youth they consecrateda grove (as Pausanias recounts) in the fields of Corinth,and also built a temple, and the goddess had anothertemple in the Circus Maximus, as appears by Titus Livius,which enjoyed a pre-eminence above all other temples ofRome, for in this one delinquents could take refuge, aswas formerly done in churches, and if, when released fromprison, they carried to it their shackles and fetters, andhung them upon its walls, they would remain free. Weshall not be overdoing it if we demonstrate how thisharmonises with the youth of our saint for having reachedthis flower of the age; we shall find him doing mostheroic things, becoming a succour to the Church, a joy tothe faithful, a help to Christianity, the comfort of penitents,and a cup-bearer of heaven, because, by means of thesacred languages which we shall see him commencing tolearn (the Hebrew, Chaldean, and Syrian), he will giveto drink of the divine nectar of the sacred Scriptures tothe other gods, the holy doctors of the Church. He willPROEM165manifest the growth of his beard, for it sprung early inlife by dint of the severe penances he practised, and onbeing shaved for the first time will exchange the togastained by the blows of penance for the toga pure andmanly, the Church will have cause to rejoice and feast.He will then be like a privileged temple, where delinquents may resort, and, suspending the fetters of theirignorances, quitting the prison-house of evil deeds andvices, will be made free.Here shall we see him, alreadywedded to this Hebe (our Jerome like to another Hercules),conquer and tame more monsters with his pen than didthat other old man with his club.DISCOURSE THE FIRSTSt. Jerome commences in the Desert the Study of Hebrew.THE combat did not cease, nor did the enemy of mankindoffer a truce to our saint. He tempted him by day andby night, he wearied him with illusions, false appearances,by foul representations, and impure imaginings.Thediligence of the saint did not suffice, nor the holy meanshe adopted, nor the many victories and crowns he gainedAgainover the devil deter the enemy from his assaults.and again he would return to renew the combat, andessayed by every means to effect an entrance.But Godwas watching Jerome like to another St. Anthony, andHe would fling His soldier at the enemy's face, and cryout to him, “What now do you think of my servantJerome * Do you imagine there is any one like to himon earth?” At this Satan's rage would kindle up, andrenew the temptation by bringing before the saint newvisions and representing to him such vivid imaginings,that he would drive him out of his cell, and as he himselfhas declared, he dared not re-enter it, but would wanderthrough the desert striving to efface these images bychange of place. Wishing to make an end to all this, orat least to repress these temptations, or better said, inorder that God should work out the life of His saint andof the Church, by the road He desired to pursue, which isI66THE STUDY OF HEBREW167that of drawing great good from the evil actions of theenemy, God inspired into the mind of His servant Jeromethe desire which was to fructify and yield great things forthe whole of the Church.This thought was, that in orderto dispel these violent temptations from his imaginationhe should occupy himself in the study of the Hebrewlanguage, a thing which in the Church had been attemptedbut by the few, such as an Origen and an Eusebius, andI know not whether by Epiphanius and Clement.And as God knows how to dispose allhings harmoniously, since He is the Lord of all, He afforded himin the desert on that very occasion a master to that effect,in order that in all things His divine providence shouldclearly be made manifest.That the holy doctor commenced this study while yetin the desert, and in order to deliver himself from thewarfare which the enemy waged against him, he himselfdeclares, in the Epistle he wrote to Rusticus the monk, inthe following words:"—"Whilst yet a youth, and despitethat I was enclosed and hidden in the most secret part ofthe desert, I could neither make progress nor withdrawfrom the war which was made against me by the fire ofvices and the heat of my own nature, which in spite of myendeavours to subdue and break by long-continued fasts,yet did not suffice, because my very imagination itself hadcaught fire.In order to bridle it, it occurred to me tobecome a pupil of one of the brethren dwelling in thedesert, who was himself a Hebrew, and had become converted to the faith. Thus, in order that, after the subtletiesof Quintilian, the eloquence of Tully, the depths of Frontonius, and the mellifluousness of Pliny, I might learn theHebrew alphabet, and should be dwelling on the wordswhich he pronounced with a kind of gnashing of the teeth,1 Epist. 4, ad Rust.168| THE LIFE OF ST. JEROME •and as it were a gasp. What trouble did it all cost me !And how many difficulties did I encounter, and how oftendid I despair of success! How often did I put it aside,and how often did I persistently take it up anew !Allthis is my soul not only a witness, but also the conscienceof those who dwelt with me.But I give God thanks,because out of the bitter seeds of those letters I cullsweet fruits.”From all this that our saint has said there seems toarise some things which require to be struck out, and letthe first be the last.It is true to say that his intention wasto learn the holy language, in order that by such a saintlyoccupation he might deliver himself from the importunatethoughts which the devil sought to put in his mind; forthis motive does he discover in these words, because itwas to this purpose that Rusticus counselled him, in orderto manifest to him how many were the evils idlenesscauses in the soul; nevertheless, despite all this, he hadundoubtedly very high aims in undertaking the study soearnestly. Among these, the first and the chief one wasthat which God put in his heart, viz. to work in His Churchso sovereign a favour as to give her a doctor consummately learned, and so sound in principle that he shouldnot only teach holy dogmas and doctrine like the otherdoctors, but that he should open the original fountainwhence they had sprung, and draw down drink fromthat source alone without seeking any streams, that is tosay, translating from the original Hebrew and Greek theOld and the New Testament, thus collecting the watersSuch other transwithout passing through any channels.lations as existed at the time in Latin of the sacredscriptures, as far as regards the Old Testament, were nottaken from the Hebrew and done into Latin, but fromHebrew into Greek, and then from the Greek into Latin,THE STUDY OF HEBREW169and if any such existed it was not the true and legitimatework of a son of the Church. And whereas this questionof the translations is one of such gravity, and must betaken leisurely farther on, for it forms a very principalpoint in the history of our saint, I will say no more respecting the motive and end, but will confirm the fact withhis own words, found in the twelfth chapter on Jeremiasaddressed to his disciple Eusebius Cremonensis, and whichare as follows:– “The devil has no common patiencethat I should enjoy the quietude I so desired; and that Ishould occupy myself with the declaration of the divineletters, and that to men who speak my own tongue (thatis the Latin), I should afford them information of thedepth and erudition of the Greek and Hebrew letters, butby day and by night, in secret and in public, does Satanpersecute me.”" The same thing does he affirm in thePreface to his Commentaries on Daniel. And when writing to Sunia and to Fratella he says as follows:—“In thesame way as when among the Latins there arises anydifferences in the books of the New Testament, that weresort to the fountain of the Greek language, in which theNew Testament was originally written, for elucidation, soalso if any difference occurs among the Greeks or Latinsin respect to the Old Testament, recourse is had to theHebrew text and truth, thus seeking to understand themfrom the streams that come forth from the fountain itself.”This sentence of our doctor is placed in the Decree,”to which also St. Augustine alludes in his books of theChristian doctrine, where he says: “The men of theLatin race, for whom we write this, have need of both theother languages, Greek and Hebrew, for the knowledgeof the divine scriptures; because, if there should ariseany difficulty from the various translations of the Latin1 Proem, lib. iii. De Hier. tom. iv.Dist. 9, cap. Ad Veteres.17oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEinterpreters, let them have recourse to the first texts inwhich they were written.”It also appeared to St. Jerome that the Hebrewlanguage was the mother, and as it were the origin, of allthe other languages. He desired to know them all fromtheir origin, and attain to the root of the first, learning itThat this was also a motive for purwith great diligence.suing the study he declares on expounding the third chapterof Sophonias,” where he says: “The word Wugas I knowingly left as it was, because it is the same in the Hebrew.From this we can understand how the Latin tongue isenclosed in the Hebrew, and that the Hebrew is themother of all the languages, but I now cannot declare it.”When writing to Pope Damasus the interpretation of thevision of Isaias, among other things he says: “That theHebrew is the beginning of all languages, and of the Latintongue which we speak, in which said Hebrew the OldTestament is written, is taught by all antiquity.Becauseafter the sin and offence offered to God in the buildingof the proud Tower of Babel was effected, confusion oftongues took place in all nations, and these differences ofspeech were spread throughout the world.”"How much truth there is in this which our doctorteaches, that the first language of the world had been theis the mother of all languages isHebrew, and that itconfirmed by common opinion.Moreover, many of theHebrews affirm, and the doctor himself confirms it, thatHebrew eventually will be the last language, and the onlyone in the world, as appears in his Commentaries on theSecond Chapter of Sophonias; and whereas the digressionwould be too lengthy were we to attempt to prove thisfrom his standpoint, we shall leave the question for anotherCom. in Sophon, cap. 3. 1, 8.Epist. 142, auto medium.August 3, De Doctrina Christiana.THE STUDY OF HEBREW171occasion.And when, farther on, we shall treat of thetranslation which the holy doctor made of the Old Testament from the Hebrew into Latin, and the New Testamentfrom the Greek into Latin, we shall manifest whether theVulgate translation which the Church uses be the onewhich St. Jerome made in the whole or in part.Likewise,we shall also treat of the integrity and purity of theHebrew text, in which the sacred scripture was dictatedby the Holy Ghost. At present we solely consider themotive which the saint had in undertaking the study ofHebrew at the cost of so much trouble. And the secondwill be to consider from his own words the difficulty whichhe himself dwells upon when he places his conscience ashis witness, and that of others, affirming that oftentimeswould he give it up as though in despair, and at othertimes would renew the study with the determination ofconquering its difficulty, or because it pleased God heshould not lay it aside.In two things it strikes me the difficulty consisted inthose days; because at the present day it is comparativelyan easy thing, and an affair of few days' work: the firstwas the absence of vowels in writing this language as isused in others, because in Hebrew there were never any,but only consonants, which is the firm and substantial partof diction, leaving the vowels to the good intelligence, thefulness and perfection of the educated lip and accustomedto the language.And whereas this is such an extraordinary thing, and so new in all languages, and in thosetimes there were no arts or grammars, and all dependedon the use and custom, it became a most difficult thing toovercome, because it depended on a good memory,exercise and a carefulness well-nigh continual. SomeJews affirm, who have been converted to the faith fromthe synagogues of Africa, in our own times, and with172THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwhom I have conversed upon this point, that as they havenot the arts and the grammars which we have, nor indeedare these permitted them, it takes many years for them tolearn the language, and indeed after great labour few everattain to a perfect knowledge.Hence, if to this be addednot having vowels, or stops, as was the case in the time ofour saint, it would be almost impossible to acquire it.Yet all these difficulties did he conquer, persevering andlabouring, assisted by his genius and wonderful memory,which he in truth possessed to an extreme degree. Thatarts and rules were wanting, and that there were no pointsin place of the vowels in this language in the time of ourdoctor, is most clear.It would suffice as a proof to findthat although many occasions offered themselves in whichit appears almost imperative that he should mention it,yet he does not do so, nor any one else of those of histime who were acquainted with the language.There are not wanting authors' of repute who affirmthat the stops which we see now beneath, or above, or inthe middle of letters which are consonants, and that arethere in place of vowels, are as ancient as the Scriptureitself, indeed have existed since the time when Godtaught it to Moses, or at least from the time of Isaias andhis disciples, especially of those two who succeeded him,called, the one Ben Neptalim and the other Ben Asser,who were great scribes in the law.But both the one andthe other are mistaken, and it is ignorance of history, andlittle erudition and learning. The Jews themselves, bycommon agreement, affirm in their histories that in the year436, after Vespasian and Titus his son had destroyed thecity and the temple of Jerusalem, that it was in the 78thyear after the birth of Christ our Lord, in the pontificateCeballerius apud Genebrad. in proem. Salm. Galatin. lib.1, cap. 8; LiliumGregor. Gerald. de poetarum hist. dial. 1.Genebra. Cron., lib. 3, p. 251.THE STUDY OF HEBREWI73fromtheirforefathers and masters,Palestine, to which councilof Pope Simplicius, forty-nine years after St. Peter, and inthe seventh year of the Empire of Zenon, there wasgathered together a council of the chiefs of the Jews, whohad escaped that famous ravage wrought on them in thecity of Tiberias inalsoassisted such as were able from Babylon, and that in thiscouncil it was ordained that, forasmuch as they were dailysuffering new trials, and found themselves surrounded bygreat misfortunes, carried to various towns in captivity,and even scattered about, thereby losing communicationswith each other, it was imperative that thereby theywould lose good pronunciation, accent, and the legitimatepunctuation of the sacred writings, which they hadEsdras,learnedGamaliel, Joshua, Eleazar, and many others; it would beexpedient and necessary for them to set all this down,marking out these points in all the future books theyshould write.It was then and there that the stops andaccents were invented which we now see in the HebrewBibles without touching the letters, as we shall statefarther on. The chief of these masters, it is said, wereRabbi Aaron, Ben-Asser, Rabbi Jacob, and Ben-Neptalim;and it is added, that when between the two they didnot agree as to the vowel or the accent, they put theone version of the lesson in the body and context, and theother version on the outside, and some would followthe one and others the second one. Thus are we told byR. David Kimi on the 60th Psalm, and in this way dothe various lessons appear at the present time in allHebrew Bibles, with great accordance, although theseare not by far so many as appear in the Vulgate transThis is the history which is very well knownlation.to all.At this period our doctor most undoubtedlyhad been dead more than thirty years, and thus was174THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEunable to avail himself of this punctuation and otheradvantages.From all that has been said in passing, we are warnednot to contemn the various translations of the scriptures,and still less the study of the holy language, for thesaintly doctor concludes, with forcible reasoning, that thepregnant words, full and ambiguous of a language, moreparticularly of Hebrew, cannot be explained by a singleword in another tongue, and that it is well-nigh impossibleto translate them into another language conveying thesame depth and fulness of signification of the original, andmust ever be short of the wide and full sense conveyed inHebrew. And whereas the Holy Ghost chose the Hebrewlanguage in order to declare great secrets in one word,there is not formed any one single word, as though bychance and without a heavenly concord; and when it istranslated, one translation expresses one meaning, andanother translation interprets another meaning, yet all aregood and of great profit, yet withal, much still remainshidden. We would have small difficulty to understandthis to be as certain as though it were of faith, if weconsider the words which the Holy Ghost speaks throughJesus, son of Sirach, in the Prologue of Ecclesiasticus,when, enhancing the difficulty of translating Hebrew eveninto Greek, a language so rich and copious as it is, heconcludes with this actual sentence: “The words takenfrom the Hebrew remain, as it were, clipped when weAn infinite numberchange them into another tongue.”of examples might we give to illustrate this sentence ofI will,our doctor, or better said, of the Holy Ghost.however, furnish one or two in order that all mayunderstand.1 “Nam deficiunt verba hebraica quando fuerint translata ad alteram linguam inprol. Ecclesiast.”THE STUDY OF HEBREW175When, in the book of Exodus, God spoke to Moses onthe manner of sacrifice, and directed how the lamb shouldbe eaten on the eve of the day when he was to set themfree, He said, among other rites, that it should be eatenin haste: Et comedetis festinanter. To this word corresponds one in Hebrew which sounds not only in haste, butalso expresses astonishment, terror, reverence, admiration.And in all these meanings is this word found interpretedin other places of the sacred Scriptures; for instance, aswhen in the Psalm it says: At the voice of Thy thunderthey shall fear, where in place of the Latin formidabuntthere stands the actual word in Hebrew of chipazon, andwhen again in the Psalm is said, Ego dixi in excessu meoIn my excess and contemplation Iomnis homo mendax.said, “Every man is a liar,” there occurs the same word tosignify excess and admiration.It stands clearly from this,that the Holy Ghost placed that word so pregnant in aplace of great mystery, in order to signify in one word thehaste we must make to quit the captivity of sin; andbecause this must be done by means of the passion andthe sacrifice of the Lamb Jesus Christ, it must be effectedwith much reverence, trembling, and awe. And he whoconsiders how deeply the Lord loves us, that He gavefreely His own Son to redeem the slave, must needs comeforth out of himself in an ecstasy, raised above his senses,and a hundred other marvellous things which are hereinenclosed, and which cannot be understood by only oneversion which is given, viz. “Thou shalt eat in haste,” norby a second one which says “with reverence.”These are words of St. Jerome wherein he expresseshow greatly the Hebrew alphabet with its deep signification of the letters afforded him matter for contemplation;and he even goes so far as to say that he pondered upon1 Ps. ciii. 7.176THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthem day and night, and thus was fulfilled in him whatDavid sings of the good tree, which will bring forth itsfruit in due season. Thus will be seen the majesty of thislanguage, in which tongue God revealed His heart andHis secrets to men, and which its mere alphabet thuscould so sweetly entertain so grave a doctor as Jerome,that he himself says he could not compare their signification to any earthly delight.It was with this study and consequent contemplationof its holiness and pregnancy that Jerome closed the doorupon his importunate imaginings, and opened it wide inorder to behold such great treasures as this study revealedIt was by this way that he overcame the enemy.to him.By these means does he keep his passions in subjection,because idleness is a very large gate for the enemy toenter in who never loses sight of an occasion or means.And to Rusticus, monk, he writes thus: “He who intruth considers the divine letters, and loves the science ofthe Scriptures, will certainly not love the vices of theflesh; and he whom the devil always finds engaged insome occupation, has small chance of fixing him with vaindesires and evil intentions. This was the first undertakingour saint engaged in during his youthful days. May itplease God to plant similar desires in our own hearts;because a youth who is occupied in evil things can onlyby a miracle avoid falling miserably.”DISCOURSE THE SECONDSt. Jerome suffers many Temptations in the Desert.is punished by God in an extraordinary Vision.HeALTHOUGH the enemy of the saints finds himself sovanquished, yet does he not, in spite of this, mitigatehis rage; the rather he tries other methods. At timeshe rests, not because he is tired, but for crafty reasons,in order that with relief neglect may arise and watchfulnessbe relaxed. He leaves aside more powerful means, becausehe finds that then he encounters greater resistance; andthus he seeks others which at first sight appear weak andof small account, but not for those who are aware of hismethods.Satan could no longer bear with patience thegood principles of Jerome; it seemed to him that a greaterwar was waged thereby than he had judged at first he hadto fear, and, knowing the foundations, he inferred conclusively that the damage would not be less that he couldexpect than what he had experienced with Paul, Anthony,Macarius, Hilary, and Arsenius. He judges, with goodreason, that those injuries were done, as it were, in passing,and a draught drank which was soon over.Here he doesnot see, however, that this one is so easily moved; ratherit seems to him that an invincible enemy has risen beforehim who in life and in death he will find very hard toIn the first encounter with the temptations ofovercome.177N178THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe flesh he acknowledges himself vanquished, and were heto experience the same results in regard to his fasts, hiswatchings, his great penances, the wearing of chains, hairshirts, the sleeping on the bare ground, the blows on hisbreast, his tears, prayers, sighs, he would carry him alongby the common way.But to see himself conquered by ayouth who stamps out thoroughly the fury of his flameswith letters, and sacred letters too, this was a bad prognostic, for this was a novel kind of victory, and consequently a mortal fall. Then he proceeds to enkindle hisgenius, and seeks a new style of warfare, and thus againstletters he places letters, and against those that are sacredhe pits profane ones.Let us investigate the scheme ofthe devil, and we shall see behind it the hand of God.St. Jerome had with him in the desert the friends wehave already mentioned — Heliodorus, Innocentius, andHylas. With these he rested awhile, and sought alleviation from the strictness of the penitential life he led byconversing and communing with them, and giving anaccount of the affairs of his soul, he to them as a father,and they to him as his sons.It seems to me that Satanmust have asked God's permission to tempt the saint inso sensitive a part by removing all his companions, someby absence, others by death.The saint tenderly loved his friends, which is anattribute of the saints, because some have been verySatan commenced with thebadly hurt on this point.first of those three above-mentioned, Heliodorus.Inorder to induce him to leave the desert he placed beforehim in a very vivid manner the widowhood of an onlysister who was very dear to him, and of a baby nephewcalled Nepotianus, whom he tenderly loved.Thus, underpretext of protecting them, he resolved to quit the desert,without taking heed of the tears of his friend or the burnTEMPTATIONS IN THE DESERT179ing reasons which he urged in order to detain him. Atlength he went. May God deliver us from such a temptation taking hold of our hearts! How many such has thedevil drawn out under this false pretext from monasteries,and how few have ever been delivered from his clutches,although Heliodorus happily was one of those released.In order to alleviate his sadness, since the bow cannotalways be on the stretch, nor could he be ever perusingsuch deep things as are the sacred writings, our saintwould take up Plato, and with his witticisms and cleverpoints the devil endeavoured to besmear in such a mannerthe soul, that what was not in appearance so sweet (as thesacred letters are not in outward dress) he would beginto cast to his face.At this period he wrote to the absent and fugitivefriend a letter, which, albeit very holy, carries its sanctity,as it were, clothed in this flowery style, and the sainthimself confesses it in the Epistle to Nepocene, saying thathe had employed in it many figures of speech and rhetoricalcolourings. The object of the Epistle was to persuade himto return to the desert, and this he does with sucherudition and wit, so full of loving phrases, such vivacityof reasoning, that I believe it has since proved powerful inthe hearts of many servants of God to induce them toleave their homes and cities and proceed to the remotestdeserts.Thus, although the enemy persuaded Heliodorusto leave Jerome, yet this letter gained over to Christ manyothers. No one who peruses it, however tepid he may be,but is fired and has fresh fuel put into him of desires forIn Heliodorus, although no suchleading a better life.great effect was worked as was expected (because hecontinued with his sister and nephew), yet it served in myopinion as a perpetual mirror of his life, for he lived in theEpist. 1.18oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEcity as in a desert, preserving the practices of the monkso closely that through them he merited that his fellowcitizens should choose him for their Prelate. The enemycontinued carrying on his scheme after having gained butlittle by his first engagement, God ordaining all to the advantage of His servants and of His Church.Innocentiuswas stricken down by so severe an illness and acute feverthat in a few days he lost his life, God taking away his soulto reward him for his pious and saintly labours.This deathgreatly wounded the heart of Jerome, because he used tocall him, a part of his soul, and such are the true friendswhen friendship has no other object but the love of God.The consolation which Jerome found during these trialswas constant prayer, the common holy exercises, turningto Christ, casting himself at the feet of the Saviour, andin return the enemy would enter in silently to console himby placing in his hands some book of the Gentiles, in orderthat he should take delight in the elegance of diction, andsweetly drink in the deceit of his malice, and thus lose thetaste for what sounded to the ear less eloquent.One other companion was yet left to him called Hylas;but this one died not long after from some illness or other,and again the wound was opened afresh ere it had beenAll this does he himself declare in an Epistlewell healed.to Rufinus’ in these words: “Innocentius, who was partof my soul, was taken from me by a sudden access ofI have only a portion of light withmalignant fever.Evagrius who, by reason of my own continued ill-health,is kept well occupied.In my company I had Hylas, aservant of the holy man Melanius, who, by the purity ofhis habits and life, filled the low condition of servant, andwith his death the wound became renewed which had notSuch was the roughness of that place,been as yet closed.Epist. 41.TEMPTATIONS IN THE DESERT181such were its many discomforts, the extremes of cold andheat so trying, the compensations so few, that naughtcould be expected but sickness and death.”Yet thesaint persevered alone and full of courage, and not satisfied still, the enemy presses him with serious and graveillnesses in order that at least thereby he should be forcedto remit the rigours of penance and put aside his holystudies. He himself affirms that there was no class ofillness which he did not experience in that desert, a thingthat amazes me, since it is clearly seen that all this wasdone by divine permission, and due to the fury of Satan.It is a subject of deep astonishment thus to see a youthwho had been brought up tenderly and surrounded bywealth, set in a desert so rough, so full of discomforts, and,moreover, always surrounded and assailed by some formor other of pain, fever, distress of mind and sadness, andthat he should remain so greatly a master of himself, sopersevering, so determined to end there his life, so fearlessof death, and always so cheerful that he actually invitesothers to come and enjoy those delights and advantageswhich, to his mind, were unequalled on earth.Somedepart from him, others are taken by death, he himselfstretched on the bare ground full of aches and pains,nevertheless all these are his glory; he faints not, nordoes he desist, nor does he surrender.Great favour wasneeded to bear such dire trials | God succours him witha great increase of grace; in secret does He solace him,because otherwise his life would be impossible to bear.Twice in the Epistle I have just quoted does he dwell onthe multiplicity of his pains, and in particular when, writingto the holy virgin Eustochium, he recounts some illnesshe had at the middle of Lent; and whereas by it is revealed the whole detail of what we have said, as well as inorder to narrate the great favour which God employed182THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEtowards him in delivering him from a form of temptationso secret and dangerous.It is imperative to recount it inhis own words. He is exhorting the virgin Eustochiumnot to read books that are profane or worldly, on accountof the great havoc they cause, without being perceived, inthe soul, and proceeds, saying: “What connection hathWhat concord hath Christ withlight with darkness?Belial?' What, hath Horace to do with the Psalter? theGospel with Virgil P Tully with the Apostles?Thebrethren would be scandalised to see you eat of what issacrificed to the idols,” and despite that to the pure allthings may be pure,” and nought should be despised thatis taken with thanksgiving, nevertheless it is not right thatwe should at the same time drink the chalice of Christtogether with that of the devils.I wish to give you anaccount of the history of my misfortune and my misery.I had now for many years determined upon deprivingmyself, for the kingdom of Heaven, of my home, myparents, brothers, and relatives, and what is more difficult,the long-accustomed luxury of great and costly viands, ondeparting for Jerusalem to dwell there, but I could notpart from my library which I had collected together withsuch care and expense in Rome, in such a manner that I,poor me, fasted so that I might be able to read Tully, andafter the long vigils of the night, where I had shed abundanttears which the memory of my sins had brought to myeyes from the very depths of my heart, I would begin toread Plautus, and if perchance seeing my peril, I, full ofrepentance, would read one of the prophets, the crudestyle would seem to mock me, and, as in the case of blindfolded eyes, I could not see the light, I judged the fault tolie in the sun and not in the blindness.” "I Cor. x. 30.3 T. t. 1.I Cor. viii. Io.Epist. 22.TEMPTATIONS IN THE DESERT183Up to this point the saint has confessed his temptationand the victory by which he would overcome the enemy—a humility proper only of a true saint. He adds, then,the narrative of the extraordinary course by which Goddelivered him and the great fruit he derived from it, andsays: “And whilst in this manner the old, crafty serpentwas thus mocking me, at mid-Lent I was assailed withsuch a burning fever in my bones and marrow, that it tookpossession violently of my body, already weakened andexhausted, that without giving me a moment of rest orrelief, it was consuming my members to an incredibledegree.To such an extreme depth of weakness wasI reduced that my bones could scarcely hold together.And meanwhile that the necessary preparations werebeing carried out for my approaching burial, and at thevery moment when the vital heat of the soul had withdrawn from all the parts of my body which had alreadygrown cold, and could only be felt in a slight degree inthe heart, I was suddenly ravished in spirit and takenbefore the tribunal of the Judge, where the brightness wassuch and the resplendency which emanated from all thosewho were present was so brilliant, that, casting myselfdown to the ground, I never once dared to raise my eyes.I freelyI was questioned as to my condition and state.replied that I was a Christian. “You lie, replied He Whopresided at that audience.“You are not a Christian buta Ciceronian, for where your treasure is there is yourheart.'I was dumbfounded at the moment, and betweenthe lashes (for I was being lashed by order of the Judge)I was more fiercely tormented by the fire of my conscience,and in my heart I considered that versicle, ‘Lord, whoshall confess to Thee in hell, or praise Thee?'I began tocall out and to say imploringly, my eyes streaming withtears: “Lord, take pity on me, have mercy on me!’ Only184THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthis cry was heard above the noise of the scourging. Atlength those that were present fell down on their kneesbefore the Judge, beseeching Him with great instance topardon my fault, alleging that I was but a youth, and togive me time to amend the error by penance, and that ifafter this experience I should again take to reading thebooks of the Gentiles, then to punish me with greatertorments.I, who found myself in such straits, verywillingly would have promised even greater things; andso I commenced to vow a thousand times and to protestand take His holy Name as witness, saying: ‘Lord, shouldI from henceforth ever hold before me the books of theI returned to myself and opened my eyes.Gentiles, were I ever again to read them or look at them,say that I have denied Thee!’ And at the very instantthat I took this oath and made the protestation I wasreleased.Allthose around me were amazed, and so bathed in tears wasI from the pain endured, that to any incredulous manwhatsoever, they would have been a sufficient testimony ofThat was not, indeed, a transport or vainmy trance.dream of those which at times occur to us and leave usmocked.

And in order thatonce and for all we may declare and reply to them, I wishto make here a minute answer to all. The first to treat ofthis was Rufinus, who, on perceiving that our holy doctorinterweaved and quoted verses and sentences of theGentiles with his speech, dared to calumniate him as a manwho had perjured himself, pointing to him as one who didnot keep the oath taken, and the promise made, to Godand before His saints. He styles him sacrilegious andperfidious, as may be seen in the places we shall furtheron state, and in such a way does Rufinus take thequestion up, that he imputes to the saint the crime ofsacrilege. To an opposite extreme do others incline whohold this as so palpable a dream, that they laugh at it asthough it were no more than a thing that is dreamed, andscoff at those who take any notice of it.This declarationwas found in the Commentary on this epistle, written byan author who, on other occasions, was in the habit ofspeaking with small reserve and very much malice.”Iwould willingly set here his words in order to makeknown the motives, but they have been erased by legitimate censure, hence there is no need to bring hisdaring words to memory.Others again" do not onlyscoff at the dream, but also at the cause of it; they saythat without reason was he scourged for being Ciceronian,because neither his style or language had anything ofOthers there are who follow another extreme,Cicero.and have been so alarmed at these scourgings, that theyheld it to be nothing less than sacrilege to read in Cicero—or indeed in any other author—of those which haveremained to us of antiquity, as though Jerome had swornon behalf also of them; and these, on witnessing that aLib. 1, Apol. in Ruff. c. 7.Eras. in Sco., Epist. 22.Angelus Politianus.186THE LIFE OF ST.

There was yet wanting to him thistemptation: since the devil could not make war on himwith it in life, he at least manifests to him his enmitywhen dead.To all these objections let us come forth to meet themwith solely one quotation of the saint himself, for, if it beReplyingproperly understood, they will all be overcome.to the crime imputed to him by Rufinus of not havingkept what in dreams he had promised, and even vowed todo, he says to him as follows: “Oh, I am made a perjurerwith a mixture of sacrilege, because in the book in whichI taught the virgin of Christ how to guard virginity, Ipromised, while asleep, before the tribunal of the Judge,not to study again secular letters, and that subsequentlyhere at times I remembered and repeat what I there conWithout doubt this is the Califurnius of whichdemned.Sallust makes mention; he who, by means of the greatorator of Rome, sent me a question of small account, toBut now let us come towhich I replied by a short letter.the matter we have in hand, and let us reply to theI declared thatobjection of the sacrilege and perjury.TEMPTATIONS IN THE DESERT187from henceforth I would not again read secular books.This promise was for the future, and I did not bind myselfby it to forget the past. You will at once rejoin anddemand, “How is it that I can remember what for such alength of time I had not read?' Were I to reply to thiswith something of the said secular books, and should say:‘This is the effect of what one is accustomed to in earlyyears, and with this I contradict you and incur the crimeof perjury, and with the self-same weapons which I shouldbring forward for my defence, I would be refuted againstwhat I defend. The remedy is for us to make a longdiscourse of all, and then the people will admit it to be afact. Which of us is there who does not recall his childhood?”Then in a skilful and graceful manner heproceeds replying to the impertinences and childishness ofRufinus, but which, however, is too long a narrative toquote, and, moreover, unnecessary. One thing is certain,that St. Jerome never called this occurrence a dream;rather he denied it being so in a forcible manner, and callsGod to witness that it was not so, as he states in theEpistle to Eustochium, “A fine manner of sleep this, tofeel the scourging of the lashes after awaking. May Inever find myself again in such dire distress.Rufinus,who calls it a dream, is ignorant when accusing me ofsacrilege, for my not fulfilling what he says I vowed to dowhen dreaming.”Otherwise let us ask our saint why itwas he so faithfully and carefully abstained from readingthese secular books, but because he never held it to havebeen a dream, ever present to him the gravity of the case,for he pondered over it in his soul, acknowledging thegreat favour of God who had delivered him in so singulara manner from so grave and dangerous a temptation, bothas to the vain delight which he felt in the perusal of thosebooks and in the amount of time he spent over them.188THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEAnd what is more serious still, because by their perusal hewas losing the taste for the sacred Scriptures, towardswhich God was carrying him with the highest aims to thegreat advantage of His Church.It only remains to be stated as the ending of thisdiscourse (to such as are devout to our saint) what werethose scourgings, what dream, what rapture was that heredescribed, for it is well to know this because it was soextraordinary a thing.In the first place, the saint saysthat he was suddenly ravished in spirit, from which it ismanifest that it was not due to melancholy induced by theillness, which being earthly and human possesses theproperties of earth and compresses the soul in the interior.For many persons when in this state believe that they seevisions, and that they have revelations, when in truth theyneither see the one nor hear the other, but which are duepurely to the form of sickness which inwardly fiercelyagitates and induces fantasies. Nor was it a dream (sincethis does not occur in bodies so exhausted and wasted ashis, nor in so sudden a manner), but it was a rapture sentby God, by the divine virtue of which the soul is raisedwithout having the power to resist, nor able to help itself;and for this reason is it called rapture, violent ravishment,as in the excess or ecstasy that springs from the vehementpropension to the thing loved. The soul, I say, rises upabove all its natural conditions, by divine virtue, to knowand see something supernatural without in the work, theunderstanding taking advantage of any sensitive power,it rather remains very abstracted and soaring above it all,so that by its lowliness to impede so lofty an operation.Hence, there remained in the saint the spirit united to thebody as in its proper form, yet withdrawn from thesenses; and there he saw that Majesty, throne, light, andJudge by spiritual representation. The scourging, althoughTEMPTATIONS IN THE DESERT189painful, he did not feel with the body and sense offeeling which there worked nothing, but with the actualapprehension of the soul; because although, after comingto himself, he felt the wounds, as they were not causedby a material instrument, but by the spiritual and mostefficacious ministry of the angels, were not perceived bythe persons present, nor did the body itself feel thepunishment until the time when the soul, on returning tothe use of the senses, these all performed their office, andthe part hurt was relieved by the blood, and the wealsbegan to show, and the wounds were made manifest, thenresulted the pain, and the tears burst forth.Marvelssuch as these does God perform on behalf of His saints,and oftentimes does He raise them and ravish them inthis manner, either to show them great things, or for theircorrection, or for our example.Well might Jerome fromthis moment acknowledge and claim to himself that hewas very much a child of God, and of the number of themore greatly favoured, because if the Holy Ghost Himselfdeclares that He chastises all those He receives as Hissons, and we clearly see that He does not lead Jeromealong the path of ordinary chastisements, but that HeHimself in person comes to correct him, it is a sign andprognostic that He is fitting him for great things. Manyof these marvels are here being revealed to us, and agrand field might be shown did the course of this historypermit it, but what we have said on this point suffices.DISCOURSE THE THIRDSatan persecutes St. Jerome in the Desert by means ofHeretics until he forces him to quit it.SATAN found himself vanquished in all the encounters hehad had with this holy monk, and that the weapons heemployed were of no use, for the saint unravelled all hiswiles and countermined all his engines of war. To theevil thoughts and fantasies suggested by him, Jeromereplied by fasts, vigils, and prayers; to excessive ardoursby striking his breast, by sleeping on the bare ground, byIf he deprives him of his friends hegroans and sighs.only adheres more firmly to God; if he inflicts upon himgrave illnesses and maladies, he doubles his crown byexercising patience; and that when deprived of the solaceof reading the elegant Books of the Gentiles, he could noteven then enter into him, because all his readings werecentred in the Scriptures and in spiritual thoughts.Satan burns with rage and is torn with envy; he fearsfar more the future result than the present loss; it seemedto him that in all this Jerome stands the victor, that hewill plant a greater school than Anthony did in othertimes; in his mind's eye he already saw him famouseverywhere, and the fame of this youth carried swiftlythrough the globe, of this youth who, born of nobleparents, yet leaves the West and Rome and even his own190PERSECUTIONS IN THE DESERT191country, learned in the Latin and Greek tongues, and noweven well advanced in the principles of Hebrew.Alreadyan erudite philosopher and in the knowledge of the sacredScriptures learned beyond all the known learned in thoseparts of the East, a youth of great hopes, and above allelse famous for the sanctity of his life.The astute enemy then takesto makerenewed war.

JEROMEMeletius, and the third Vitalis, each of these wantingJerome for himself, feeling confident of easy victoryagainst the two other parties should he enlist such aid onhis part, for such was the authority and the name heAll these parties were in great haste; the Prelates,carried.so that Jerome should declare which would he decideto attach himself to and obey; the heretics on their sideurged him to declare himself an Arian. The latter werewell aware it would be impossible to accomplish thissuddenly and openly. They approached him by degrees,desiring him to acknowledge in God three hypostases.Although our holy youth well understood that in confessingthis there was no difficulty nor danger in reality and inthe thing, because among learned men hypostases in Greekmeans the same as in Latin, and in common parlancepersona, yet he would not do so, in order not to concertThat it be thewith them even their mode of speaking.same in Greek hypostases as persona in Latin the holyfathers of the Greek Church themselves declare.St.Basil wrote an Epistle to his brother Gregory of Nyssaon this, and tells him that ousta is what the Latins callnature and essence or substance; and what the Greeksexpress by hypostasis is for the Latins the same as suppositusSt. Athanasius teaches the same, and St.or persona.Gregory Nazianzen refers that he was the one who taughtthe Greeks that what to the Latins is persona is hypostasisto them, and vice versa, so that neither the one nor theother should have any suspicion of the terms. All this thesaint knew very well, and thus did he understand it andNevertheless, he woulddeclared when he was questioned.not employ the same diction as the heretics, nor theirmanner of speaking, because as the same Gregory ofNazianzen refers, at that period it had become very odiousto the Latins the term hypostasis, and with greater reasonPERSECUTIONS IN THE DESERTI93was it odious to St. Jerome, since these heretics set greatdiligence in that they should confess three hypostases.From all this haste and the importunate charge they laidagainst him, the saint was inspired to take refuge in thesafe stronghold of the faith, which is the Roman Church,and refer to her Pontiff, who at the time was Damasus,a native of Spain, and despite that they had but smallintercourse with one another, yet Jerome was inspired towrite to him.The chief points touched upon were toask him instructions whether he should consent, andconfer, with the heretics declaring three hypostases; andthe second as to which of the three Prelates of Antiochhe was to join and give his obedience.He wrote two letters upon this question, both worthyIof being read, and both very necessary in those times.will transcribe here the most important parts of them.Inthe first he says as follows: “Whereas on account of theancient fury the cities of the East are broken up andunhealthy, and the tunic of the Lord without a seam andundivided is now divided into parts; the foxes are destroying the vineyards of Christ to such an extent that thebroken cisterns cannot retain the water, and with greatdifficulty can it be discovered where that sealed fountainand the enclosed garden are, I have resolved to takerefuge as in a true haven in the chair of Peter, and inthat faith so praised by the apostolic mouth, because inher I found, and do find, the food of the soul, where oncebefore I had received the tunic and vesture of Christ.And I shall not be deterred from seeking this preciouspearl by reason of the wide sea which stands between, norby the far-distant lands, for where the body is there willthe eagles be gathered together, and spent out and wellnigh consumed by the evil generation is the patrimony,and it is close to you that is kept pure and in its integrityO194THE LIFE OF ST.

Then hecontinues to propose his doubt to Damasus, and adds thathe does not wish to serve under Vitalis or Meletius orPaulinus, because it appears to him that they are neithersubject to, nor united to, the Roman pontiff.He alsomakes known to him that they are urging him with greatinsistence to confess the three hypostases, and at the end of- - - - -PERSECUTIONS IN THE DESERTI95the letter he says: “Well does the word hypostasis declarethree subsistent persons, and when I say that I also understand it so, they judge me to be a heretic. Why dothey weary themselves so much about a word? What isit that they keep hidden beneath this ambiguous term ?If they thus believe it, as they declare they do, I do notcondemn what they feel on the subject; if I believe it to beso, as they dissimulate or pretend they believe, let thempermit me to declare what they say they feel, in my ownwords.Therefore I humbly beseech your Beatitude forthe Saviour of the world crucified, and for the essence ofthe Holy Trinity, that you write to me an epistle and giveme the permission whether to keep silence or to speak,in regard to the question of the three hypostases. Andwhereas the seclusion of this remote place in which I livemight perchance be mistaken, address the messenger toEvagrius the presbyter, who is well known to you, withthe replies.And at the same time do you declare tome your will as to which of the three prelates of AntiochI am to communicate with, because the Campenses heretics,together with those of Tarsus, have no deeper scheme thanwith your authority, and with the confidence that they arein union with you, to preach the three hypostases in theancient sense.”St. Jerome here styles the ancient sense not that whichwas given in the Nicene Council, but that of the Arians.That expression which the holy doctor employs of communicating is an ancient ceremony, used in those timesin the Church. When there were partialities and divisions,those who followed one class and confessed one samething, after having received the holy Eucharist, had somesign or countersign" by which they were known and comTessera=sign or countersign; a cubical piece of wood or bone used by theRomans.196THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEmunicated.Thus does Innocent I. declare it, and hestates that it was usual in Rome to send a small quantityof unleavened bread throughout the parishes, which wasThis is the origin of the use ofthe sign or symbol.blessed bread, which, even at the present day, is distributedto the faithful on Sundays, and which they carry home;hence the term employed of communicating, and also ofthe custom which I believe is as ancient as the commencement of the Church. The same thing does St. Paul expressin the first epistle to the Corinthians, when, under theexpression of communicating in the bread and in thechalice of the sacrifices, and in the table of the OldTestament, and in that which is offered to the idols; andin their offerings he distinguishes the three states andsects of the world—the Christians, the Jews, and theGentiles.By thisis seen the great respect, reverence, andobedience that St. Jerome professed to the Roman Churchand to the Pope, and how he seeks refuge and security inthat Church, and to her faith only does he trust himself,since her sole authority suffices to put down the proudjudgments of those who rise against her and who miserablyfall into the abyss.The second letter contains in substance the same asthe aforesaid, that pressure was being used, that thedistance was very great, and his place of dwelling sosecluded that there was small chance for letters to reachhim; and then he goes on to say:” “The importunatewoman spoken of in the Gospel” at length merited to beAlthough the friend had already retired for theheard.night, his door closed, the young men asleep, neverthelessthe friend received the loaves, although she had come atmidnight.

Themonks who reside round about here, with the authority ofancients, rise up against me; meanwhile that I in a loud1 Horace.198THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEvoice proclaim: ‘He that shall unite with the chair ofPeter, he, and he alone, is mine; Meletius, Vitalis, andPaulinus, each one tells me he belongs to you.'I mightbelieve it to be so if this were said to me by one, but nowthat by contrary acts they pursue one another, I say this,either two of them lie, or all three of them; therefore Ihumbly beseech you, by the cross of the Lord, by what isdue to the honour of our faith, and by the passion ofChrist, that whereas you bear the apostolic dignity, doyou also carry the merit; hence with the twelve do yousit to judge the world: thus may another bind you asPeter, and thus may you attain the dwelling of heavenwith St. Paul: and with your letters do you advise meand instruct me as to which of these in Syria I am tocommunicate with and join; and do not despise this soulfor whom Christ died.”These are letters which should not be left unread byany one, and even be perused many times over.It wouldbe well that those who esteem the saint for his greaterudition should also admire and trust him in this partand imitate him, bending low their proud necks to theauthority of the pontiff in simple obedience, since Jerome,with so much humility and love, inclines his head and hisheart.We have no account of the reply of Damasus to theseletters, but by the text of many other letters which thesetwo saintly men wrote to one another it is inferred that hedid reply to them. Time and its changes, which consumeseverything, has wrought in this particular as with othersacred monuments of the antiquity of the Church. Whatmay be gathered from this is that the holy pontiff, inview of these epistles and the eloquence and eruditionin all his letters, conceived a great affection for Jerome.It appears to be the fact that even before he came toPERSECUTIONS IN THE DESERTI99Rome he knew him well, and had written to him severalletters asking for declarations on some difficult passages inthe Scriptures. Such great fame had this saintly youthLet us leave this for its proper place,already attained.and return to witness the haste with which the heretics—or the devil for them—employed in his regard in order todisquiet that holy soul and drag him out of the remotedesert.When these heretics perceived that they could notshake his opinion, nor overturn the foundations of thestronghold laid upon so firm a rock as that of the obedienceand faith of the Church, they turned against him likefurious dogs, howling and barking, imputing to him vices,and defaming him in what places they could, and eventhey, who were themselves heretics, calling him a heretic,proclaiming him as such, as though he could be so who isTheirsubject, bound, and obedient to the apostolic See.defamations reached to the point that some saintly virginswho lived in observance on Mount Hermon began towithdraw from him. The saint was devoted to them onaccount of their sanctity; he oftentimes wrote to them,but after they had this evil opinion induced into them,never again would they correspond with him.Jerome,feeling hurt at this, rather on account of the deceit practisedon them than of his own hurt, wrote to them in this wise:—letter and parchment areindicative of solitude, hence I have to condense thecopiousness of what I had to say into a small space.Iwould wish to speak to you in a large manner, and yet theshort page forces me to be silent, and thus skill must overcome poverty; the letters are few, while the reasoning islong.In this strait charity aids me, since even the wantof the wherewith to write upon prevents me from writing.I say it withI beseech you to pardon the wounded one.“The small size of the2OOTHE LIFE OF ST.

The implacableenemy, who was weaving the warp of the piece, did notcease his vigilance. The more the saint manifests withhumility his innocence by silence and abasement (even tomislead women), so much more does he grow fierce. Theaffair among the heretics had attained to such a fieryheight against the saint that they wreaked upon him allthe evil treatment which they could.At length thescheme of the capital enemy is made manifest that hewould force Jerome to quit the desert, for with nothingless can his rage find an outlet. Oh! divine judgments!So also does God will it. For this is the common way withHim in dealing with the lives of the saints, yet the ends aredifferent; the one schemes the fall of Jerome, in order tostem the flow of the current towards that sanctity, to whichhe is journeying, and bring him back to the world; theother to lift him up to great things of His service; tomake him a master of perfection in the world, and a greatdoctor of His Church ! God does not wish—no—that hislife should be all spent in deserts and solitude; it was allvery well to prove him and to exercise him for a time, sothat the master of all should taste of everything.Afterspending four years of a life so rough yet saintly, practisingsuch rigorous penance, the heretics pressed around him soviolently with their malice that there were no means strongenough to resist them in a young man, alone in a strangeIt occurred to him asland, without friends or protectors.2O2THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEa last resource to withdraw and give in to envy. Thesaint himself depicts to us the battle and the power theheretics brought on to bear, when writing to Marcus, apriest of Chalcedon, in these words: “I have resolvedupon taking advantage of the advice contained in thewords of the Psalmist, where he says: “While the sinnerwas against-me, I was struck dumb and was humbled, andheld my peace, and even in what I could have spoken to theAnd in another part: ‘I wasPurpose, I remained silent.like one deaf and did not hear, and as one dumb I did notopen my mouth, I am made like a man who hears not.

The conversationhe held with his holy companions was very sweet, theirpersons and their feet stood materially there on earth, buttheir conversation and intercommunion was of heaven, and .in Heaven were all things.Every time, when, after thisthe saint has occasion to speak of this period of his lifeand this dwelling, it can well be perceived how deep is thefeeling and the grief he experienced at its loss, and heusually says in regard to it, the words of David: Lord, oneday in the courts of Thy house is better than a thousand inthe dwellings of kings.In the epistle he wrote to hisgreat friend Pammachius, he renews this memory and says:“I was not then in Rome, because the desert held me,and would to God that it held me always”; and otherexpressions to the same effect. At length Jerome cameforth from the desert, or better said, God drew him out,working by the hand of the enemy His own cause andthat of the Church.

Some style him “most holy,”others “divine,” and others again most meek; but for allthat he had been consecrated by the Arians, and this wasa matter of much suspicion to Jerome as well as to others.Therefore, being under the authority of that part of theChurch ruled by Paulinus, Jerome, without heeding itsrevolts, or interfering in the pretensions of the bishops andof the world, for all these at the time were the offices andNiceph. lib. 17, cap. 12.Theod. lib. 5, cap. 3.BECOMES A DISCIPLE OF APOLLINARIS209ministries of the Holy Ghost, carried his soul full of otheraffections and desires.

Jerome listened to him, culled fromhis discourses the best that was in him, enjoyed his genius,but what was not his best he put aside.This conductdoes he himself declare he followed when writing to“Alas! says Isaias to suchPammachius and Oceanus.that say evil is good and good evil: those who make bittersweet and what is sweet bitter. We must not speak evilof the good we see in our adversaries, nor praise the vicesof friends, nor weigh the worth of each one by his person,but by the value which his things have and which we see.Lucilius is reprehended because he is not a very polishedpoet, nor his metre smooth, but his wit and subtleties arelauded by all. When I was a youth I burned with desiresof knowledge, and I do not wish, as many others presume,to teach myself nor be my own master. Many times didIlisten to Apollinaris Laodicensis in Antioch, and Iesteemed him greatly, and although he instructed me inthe sacred scriptures, yet not for that did his pertinaciousopinions please me any more than his bad doctrine.” Thisis a good counsel of St. Jerome, worthy of his spirit anddiscretion. Of the error of Apollinaris there is no needto give an account here, for it is nothing to our purpose.Such as desire to know further, and understand radicallythe differences of Antioch, may read the authors contemporary with him.In many other places does our saint mention Apollinaris,and never does he disclaim having been a disciple of his,Epist. 63.P2 IOTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEand always under the conditions and reserve I havealready stated, in order to profit from the good in him,yet without turning his eyes or even casting a glance uponMany, through not doing this, and beingwhat was evil.so sensitivein regard to every small defect whichthey meet which does not please them, lose the enjoymentof a thousand treasures, as though pearls laid among asmall portion of straw could lose their intrinsic value aspearls.Great geniuses often fall owing to their singularopinions, which commonly are not pleasing, yet not forthat should we despise them; rather we should proceedvery carefully with them, and listen to them, for theyusually have most singular and beautiful ideas, and sometimes it so happens that in what they most displease us isjust in what they are most excellent.I say this as regardsordinary things, for in what relates to religion we knowour path and what are the rules of the Church. Theserules had not been so strictly laid down or defined in thetime of St. Jerome, as they are at present. The hereticswere mixed up with the Catholics, and among them weremen so grave and learned that oftentimes they carriedwith them the greater part of the oriental Church. Moreover, it was most difficult at that age, when so few councilshad as yet been held, to establish the complete integrityof the dogmas. The saintly doctor lost not a single pointof the monastic life in the midst of the city.There hewalked, his soul and body wrapped in the seclusion of thedesert, and in the silence of that solitude into which Godtakes His own when He speaks to the heart.Jeromenever put aside his continual penances, nor gave up hiswatchfulness, nor did he interrupt other exercises of hisearly life, like one who in all earnestness had undertakento follow the state of perfection without turning his headAt times, impelled by divine desires andto look back.ORDAINED A PRIEST BY PAULINUS2 IIthe soul's yearning to quit this prison of earth, he wouldrise above to dwell alone in those pastures of love.Then he would proceed to visit the places in the HolyLand, the fire commencing to be kindled of that greatlove he subsequently bore them.But whether he benthis steps there, or whether he proceeded elsewhere,wherever he might go for diverse reasons, he ever remainedthe strictest of monks, ever the same and always advancing,like to one of the angels of Jacob's ladder who were neveridle or still.Paulinus considered all this with great attention, for he was a man of lofty judgment. He perceivedunited together in this youth not only great erudition andletters, but also exalted religion and consummate virtue.He judged that it would be to the great advantage of theChurch and to himself, that he should be a priest, bothbecause Jerome could then help him in everything thatmight be necessary in his office, as also that he mightThis heprove him and honour him for his merits.put into practice. He ordained him priest, despite theresistance offered by the saint, who deeply felt himselfunworthy to be raised to so high a dignity, because, as hewas so learned he well knew what the priesthood was, andhow much it would entail upon him.It also appeared tohim that the state of a humble religious, and that of alowly monk, poor and solitary, did not accord with so muchgrandeur, and he therefore offered all the resistance hecould.The saintly prelate, however, prevailed, and even compelled him by obedience to accept the dignity.All thisdoes our glorious doctor briefly signify in an epistle' whichhe wrote to Pammachius against the errors of John ofJerusalem, and which we quoted above.That Paulinus was the Bishop of Antioch who ordainedEpist. 61.2 I2THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEJerome priest is proved, because in the same epistle,"speaking with the said John, he says as follows: “If whatyou say about being ordained without your license and withinyour jurisdiction, you understand it of me and of the holypriest Vincentius, you in truth have been asleep in thisaffair, since at the lapse of thirteen years you now awake.Let me inform you, that for this did I leave Antioch andhe Constantinople, cities of such renown, forasmuch as wedid not contemplate exercising the office of the priesthoodfor the praise and the applause of the people, but in orderto weep over the sins of our early youth in solitude and inthe wilderness, and thus draw upon us the mercy of JesusChrist.”This passage fully declares what we quoted.above of St. Epiphanius, writing to the same Bishop ofJerusalem, in which! the saint says that Vincentius andJerome, on account of their great humility and modesty,did not wish to exercise the office of priests among theirbrethren.Great indeed was the humility of our saint,very different from such as undertake these sacred officesSaints more greatly esteem that thefor vain motives.Holy Ghost should make His dwelling in them by the giftof sanctification than with that which appertains to theministry and office, hence they easily would leave thelatter so as to embrace the former, because to have been formany years bishop or archbishop will not enable a man togo to heaven, but it will do so to have been humble ofheart, and to have the fear of God and of His precepts.For this reason did our Lord and Master say, that unlessour justice exceeded that of the Scribes and Pharisees weThis our Lordshould not enter the kingdom of God.declared even of good Scribes and Pharisees, who inreality had the justice of the law, but not that of the Gospel,and also did He include in the number those who amongEpist. 61, cap. 16.JOINS PAULINUS213themselves were accounted just and despised others,calling them by a low and contemptuous word, populusterrae, a people who did not rise from the ground, norIt was thiscould they be equalled with them in any way.that our saint wished to fly from in the new dignity, notbecause it naturally follows it, but because pride takesadvantage of it for its hurt.Some may question why St. Jerome joined Paulinusrather than Meletius, -for as St. Gregory Nazianzen,Nicephorus Callistus, and other Greeks declare, he wasfound to be an Arian; and it appears that the doctorhimself says the same in the epistles quoted abovewhich he sent to Damasus, wherein he expresses himselfequally suspicious of the three. We have already touchedupon the reason of this, and that, despite the suspicion, itwas charged on him by Pope Damasus. The most solidreason is found to be that Paulinus, as many Greek writersrefer, among them St. Basil in his Epistle to Terentius (?)"(which epistle, although not ininsome original manuscripts) was that the Roman Churchalways held him to be a Catholic, and as such was confirmedby St. Damasus in the Pontifical chair of Antioch, this isdeclared by Socrates in his history, as well as by NiceThis being so, Jerome, who was ever obedientphorus.to the apostolic chair, could not do otherwise than attachhimself to Paulinus.It is true to say that Nazianzenand his friend Basil felt aggrieved that Meletius shouldHowever,have been excluded and Paulinus admitted.as they were not personally known to him, they did notmake any complaint.I have been unable to ascertainhow it could be that both Nicephorus and Theodoretusin the aforesaid places, should have said that both wereBishops of Antioch until their death, and that a decreeprint yetexistsMariana, in Schol. Epist. 61, D. Hier.2I4THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEhad been promulgated to all the clergy that so long asthese two lived no other should be admitted to the dignity.Be it what it may, for it does not concern the aim of ourhistory, we at least can gather how deeply our saint couldbe ruled by obedience to the Pope, and how for him, insuch cases as these, it was an infallible rule; and it alsoremains investigated that it was this Paulinus who ordainedhim; because some are mistaken who believe that itwas another Paulinus, Bishop of Tréves, who was moreremote even than St. Hilary; a thing quite out of place,for it could not possibly have been our saint, for it wasin the time of Constantius, and after the Synod of Arlesthat he was exiled, because he refused to sign the Condemnation of St. Athanasius, which was then published,as Sulpicius refers.That great thirst which St. Jerome confesses heexperienced for the study of the sacred letters made him,as we have said, to be always seeking where to satisfy andquench it. At that period St. Gregory Nazianzen wasfamous, called by excellence “the Theologian,” and St.Jerome was minded to visit him, and be his disciple inearnest. He journeyed to Greece.I believe on thisoccasion he was at Athens, because he himself declaresit when expounding the twelfth chapter of Zacharias theprophet, where occurs the following words: “I will makeJerusalem a burthensome stone to all the people, all that shall4ft it up shall be rent and torn,” the saint says that inPalestine it was the custom, and one which existed in histime, of placing round stones like boulders to mark thedivision of property, and that many resorted there to trytheir strength by lifting the heaviest and the greaternumber. Some would lift them as far as their knees,others to the waist, while others even placed them onZacharias xii. 3.ST.

And in passing we wish to draw attentionto the great importance of peregrinations, wherein arewitnessed and observed the usages and customs of differentlands, to which allusion is oftentimes made in metaphors,not only in the Holy Books, but by other writers.In allplaces do wise men find something to learn, and all things,in time, are of profit to them.The fame of Gregory for sanctity and letters continuedto increase throughout the world. Jerome sought him outand found him in Constantinople, where he had come toat the time in order to arrange certain differences infavour of Catholics against the Arians.He had beenbrought there in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius I.previous to the Council of Constantinople, this Councilbeing one of the four General Councils which St. GregoryPope declared he held in as much respect as the fourGospels.This was during the early years of thePontificate of Damasus. The great doctor of the ChurchSt. Gregory Nazianzen carried the business through withsuch skill and tact, and so lifted up the faith and placed216THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe affairs of the Catholics on such a firm footing, that allthings became altered. He was made Bishop, and, joiningtogether doctrine and authority, in a very short space oftime not a single Arian dared to appear in the city. Ofhis discipleship under such a master St. Jerome is justlyproud, and in many places in his works does he mentionIn the Catalogue of Illustrious Men he styles himhim.a most eloquent man, and that he was his preceptor fromwhom he had learned sacred letters as he had heard himIn the Epistle to Nepotian he says:"expound them.“Gregory Nazianzen, who formerly had been my preceptor, on my beseeching him to declare to me what wasmeant by that passage in St. Luke.” Sabbatum deuteroproton,id est, secundo primum, he, with charming courtesy, repliedto me, saying, “I will demonstrate this to you over therein the church, where, amid the applause of the people, youwill have to confess, whether you will or no, that youunderstand what you do not understand, and if you willnot agree to this, not joining in the applause, but keepingsilent, you will be held by all to be very ignorant.” Thesaintly theologian here distinctly acknowledges to thewise disciple that he does not know the passage, nothingoffering itself to him which could satisfy the genius ofso clever a disciple, and thus he gave him this gracefulrepartee, manifesting that it is an easy thing for a manwho has won the favour and the taste of the people tomake men believe anything he should say. To this mostlearned Nazianzen there was wanting some knowledge ofHebrew traditions and customs, for had he had suchknowledge he could have given some explanation had heunderstood the passage, which means nothing else butthe second day of the feast after the first and principal oneof the great Week, called thus the Passover of theEpist. 2, cap. Io.Luke vi. I.STUDIES UNDER ST. GREGORY NAZIANZEN217Lamb. The first day was called primo primum, and thesecond day secundo primum.Writing upon the sixthchapter of Isaias again does he say” that, being inConstantinople with his master Gregory Nazianzen, whowas bishop of that city, and the one who had instructed himin the sacred Scriptures, he made a short treatise on thevision of the prophet to test his genius, and also to complywith the request of some of his friends who had besoughthim to do so.Thirty years had passed since the sainthad written the treatise when he dictated this expositionon Isaias; nevertheless it appears to him that it should beassigned to him as it is done. From this may be inferredhow great was his erudition and doctrine, and how muchgreater still his humility, for being what he was, yet hedoes not disdain to become his disciple.Let us thereforeglance over this exposition of the vision of Isaias in orderto fully understand who and what was Jerome at thattime, both in letters as in virtue.In two epistles written to Damasus is the expositiondivided by which St. Jerome gave a proof of his genius.These epistles bear comparison with any writing of themost erudite ever issued by the Greek and Latin churches.It may be well said that in what Jerome tested his hand,and, as it were, commenced his genius, other gifted doctorsof the church ended theirs.Oh, good disciple ! At thepleading of his friends he tells us did he undertake thetask, and it was in obedience to them, for he was orderedto do so.I believe it was Damasus who was the chiefamong these, and he could not but obey him. The HolyPontiff, charmed with these epistles as well as with othershe had seen, and delighted at the renown this saintlyyouth enjoyed, asked him for many other declarationslater on. When expounding those words of the ApostleComment. in Isai c. 6.218THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEto the Ephesians, This is a great Sacrament, he says asfollows:“Gregory Nazianzen, a most eloquent manand very learned in the sacred writings, when I discussedwith him this passage, used to say, “Do you not seehow great is the mystery and hidden meaning of thischapter?For when the apostle wrote it he interpretedof Christ and His Church, and he affirms that he does notdeclare the depth with the grandeur and dignity which it.demands, but only in some part.’” He also refers” that,being together with his master Gregory Nazianzen, thebrother of the great Basil, called Gregory of Nyssa, readto them some of his works.By this is seen the greathumility of the saint, who, although it is true he callshimself a disciple, and declares he learned of Apollinarisand of Gregory Nazianzen and others, yet by the waythey all discoursed together it is evident that they learnedas much from Jerome as he from them.At this period Jerome was much advanced in theknowledge of the Hebrew as well as the Syrian language,of which we have grounds to suppose these doctors didnot possess.This was a great advantage, and is wellmanifested in the treatise on the exposition of the visionof Isaias, and others he wrote before coming to Rome.After Jerome had enjoyed the doctrine and intercourse withGregory Nazianzen, he decided to return to Palestine.Ibelieve the desire for solitude and for the monastic lifeIn some measure thehad taken possession of his soul.dissensions which were rife at this time in Constantinoplecarried some weight in the decision, for we find theyincreased day by day, because the children of that periodknew not how to be quiet, nor allowed others to enjoyquietude; they were, and are, the goats in the flock of theChurch until they be separated and set on the left hand.Comment. ad Eph. 5.In Catalog. Illust.RETURNS TO PALESTINE219Despite all that St. Gregory was, there arose against himenvious men who could not endure that the city ofConstantinople should enjoy such a pastor, and whodeclared he could not be bishop of this city, because,without synodal determination and authority, he had leftthe previous bishopric of Nazianzen and had entered theone of Constantinople. On witnessing such disquietudeof spirit, Gregory decided to yield to their evil designsand leave that see, and this decision he put in execution.Neither did he wish that one Maximus Cynicus shouldremain whom the Arians had elected, so that he shouldnot revert to his first state; and he placed one Nectarius,a man of great virtue and very learned, who was receivedFurthermore, Gregory didwith much applause by all.not wish to return to his first chair of Nazianzen, becausethe saintly prelate did not set his heart on these dignities.He issued orders forto theEulaliusbishopric, meanwhile that he himself withdrew to anestate he had of his own to dwell there for the remainderof his life, leading a saintly existence with great calmnessof spirit.to be electedAs we have said, Jerome returned to Palestine, andproceeded to visit Bethlehem.I cannot say whether thiswas his first visit, but now he commenced to foster adeep devotion to this spot, so holy and so full of tendermemories. He continued there for some time; this fact Iam quite convinced of, for he on his return spoke of theplace as familiar to him, which he would not have donehad it been for the first time.Whilst dwelling here insolitude and retirement, with only such few conveniencesas a monk of such a strict life would allow himself, heenjoyedsoulenraptured in divine thoughts, enjoying an almost continual contemplation, lifted above all visible things until hefavours fromheaven, hisa thousand22OTHE LIFE OF ST.

At this periodJerome received some letters from Pope Damasus whicharoused him from the sweet slumber of contemplation, bypropounding questions and points from the sacred scriptures.Such was the credit Jerome already enjoyed inRome, and so great the fame of his genius and learning,which had spread everywhere.is a greatsubject of marvel that so wise and saintly a pontiff asDamasus should take notice of a youth dwelling so faraway in remote lands, when so many very great andgrave doctors flourished in those days—indeed perhaps themost celebrated the Church had held—were at hand; yethe seems to have cast them in oblivion, and turns his eyeson Jerome, and to him alone does he discover his doubtsand asks a solution of them.It was due to this galaxy ofcelebrated divines surrounding Damasus that some authorssay the title of Glorious was prefixed to this pope. Bythis may be seen that the Spanish pope and saint hadgood taste, and that by the claws he had perceived the/ion, and from his brief letters he traced and scented greatthings. And in truth his judgment did not deceive him,as will be made manifest in the course of this history.Among other letters which Damasus penned to Jerome,affectionate and becoming a fatherly heart, the first was theone in which occurs the following: “I have determined torouse you who have been now a long time in the sweetslumbers of prayer and contemplation, caring naught butfor reading since you have not attempted to write anything, by sending to you for some explanations concerningcertain points and questions—not that it be not right foryou to read, which I am well aware is to you like dailybread, and a food by means of which prayer is maintainedand strengthened; but were you to write the fruit mightCORRESPONDS WITH ST.

How sweet, says the prophet, are Thy words toSweeter than honey are they tomy mouth, O Lord!my mouth.”Such reasons as these, and others as humbleand loving, does he proceed to declare. He then puts toJerome replied tohim some difficult, grave questions.these questions in a famous letter, these questions beingreplied and treated briefly and in a masterly manner, theirdifficulties dispelled clearly and firmly.The beginningof the reply runs in this form: “On receiving the letterof your holiness I at once summoned a scribe.I badehim write, while I prepared what I was to do, and thinkingwithin myself what I should say, scarcely moving mytongue and thehis pen, there unexpectedlyentered in a Hebrew, loaded with many books taken fromthe synagogue, as though to peruse them, and at onceI have here with me what you wishexclaimed, “Stay!and had asked for.He left me in doubt and confusion,without knowing what to do, for I was disturbed at hisEpist. 125.scribe222THE LIFE OF ST.

Amongthose who arrived in answer to the summons was Paulinusof Antioch,doctor hadreceived his ordination as priest, and Epiphanius, Bishopof Constantia, or Salamina in Cyprus, men of greatsanctity and letters, and both great friends of each otherand mutual ones of Jerome.It seemed opportune to theGreek bishops to take, as some say, the learned Latindivine Jerome with them, forasmuch as he had alreadyacquired a great name, and also because, as one who haddwelt in Antioch and at various times in Cyprus, he mightbe to them of great advantage in their affairs, by keepingthe pontiff informed, whensoever theoccasion shouldpresent itself, retaining him as a trustworthy witness inThese bishops were well aware of thetheir defence.intimacy which existed between Jerome and Damasusfrom the letters and the messengers which frequentlyhad passed between them, even before they had anypersonal knowledge of each other, known only by thecredit and reputation they were held in.All thesemotives were efficaciousreasons to urge these holyprelates willingly to take Jerome in their company; yet,for all that, I believe that they could not have urged anyreasons of sufficient weight to have induced him to drawaway from his beloved Bethlehem, to which, as we havesaid before, he had withdrawn himself, nor would theyhave persuaded him to quit it in order to interfere in theaffairs of a third party, however friendly he might be. Thereason, as a fact, was that they compelled him to go withQ226THE LIFE OF ST.

As a consequence the business and the difficulties of the apostolicchair were becoming infinite. Then commenced to riseheresies, sects, fictions, and novelties which were verywearing; many controversies and schisms followed in thetrain, and this most prudent pontiff judged that no moreopportune occasion would arise than to have Jerome athis side to attend on and rule such a stream of things; aman in whom he could safely place many affairs and whowould be able to reply by mouth and pen to all theepistles and suits of every kind and language, and fullysatisfy by one genius all the geniuses however greatUndoubtedly itwas by the inspiration of heaven that this thought wasDamasus enjoined by his letters, aided byconceived.those of the Emperor, that among the summoned bishopsJerome should come to Rome without admitting anypossible excuse to the contrary.

And whereas I was considered tohave attained some knowledge of the holy Scriptures, neverdid he speak to me but he would ask me something inrespect to them, nor was he easily satisfied.” From thisis clearly seen that he came to Rome by constraint. Thesame thing did he affirm in the epitaph” of St. Paula,where he declares that his coming to Rome was due toimperial letters. And it was full time—for our saint hadpassed the thirtieth year of his youth and strength—that heshould commence in things of such gravity and of suchmoment to help his mother the Church, and labour for her,relieving the burthen from the shoulders of his pastor andfather of a great portion of its weight, and shifting iton his own to favour the Christian republic; since it wasfor this that God had brought him to a state of so muchpower and virtue, and it was not in reason that so brighta luminary should be hidden away in the desert amongcrags and brambles, solely dwelling in the company ofrustic monks, for as he himself expresses it “holy rusticityprofits itself alone.”Epist. 16. c. 3.Epist. 27. c. 2.228THE LIFE OF ST.

Oncoming to this city who can doubt that he revisited thoseplaces where he had been brought up, where he had spentsome sweet years of his early youth, where he had learnthis first letters, and where he had received the vesture ofChrist? He would refresh his spirit by these visits;again would he enter the holy sepulchres and grottoes ofthe cemeteries wherein were deposited the dust of thosemen who, with generous souls, had spilt their blood inreturn for the blood of Christ; often must he have recalledto mind how in other days he had wandered about, hismind filled with childish thoughts, yet already full of themercy of heaven as far as his childish mind could hold;yet now he would view these scenes with other eyes, withmore ardent and manly thoughts, his heart swelling withgenerous courage to suffer as much himself and march onbeneath the banner of his Captain, following and pursuingthe track of the enemy whom he had already conquered inHere he enjoyed the society ofa thousand encounters.his great friend Pammachius and that of the fellow-studentsof his early years.Mutually would their countenances bebathed in tears of joy. They would look at one anotherand again on Jerome—but so altered that they hardlycould recognise him, thin, emaciated, bronzed, dry, without colour, a man of bones, his hair unkempt, his eyessunken, the eyeballs inflamed by the continual runningof hot tears, his habit poor, patched, coarse—a veritablerepresentation of an Elias, a Job, or an Anthony, in hisspeech, in his apparel, in his manner—all denoted thehermit of a rough life, of a monk full of perfection, of23o.THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEa man truly crucified to the world and transformed intoJesus Christ. They would be absorbed contemplating hispresence, and would say to him: “O Jerome ! how greatlyhave the hopes we had formed of you been realised; andthose promises of your early years how they have beenfulfilled ! Happy you, who so early in life did commenceto try the sweet yoke of the Lord! Happy indeed inwhom so quickly were engrafted the aims which the HolySpirit breathed in you, even at an age when these inspirations could scarcely have been felt, and hapless indeed arethose who like ourselves never knew how to obtain freedomfrom the bonds of the world, from the cupidity of theflesh, the pride of life, nor have attained to open thedoor at the knocking of so many inspirations as God hasoffered us.”Many other things of this sort must his friends havesaid to him, full of joy and a kind of holy emulation.Often would they question him as to how he had fared inthat frightful solitude where they knew he had withdrawnhimself to follow such strict penance, how he had spenthis life; what companions he had, what fare, where didthey sleep; what manner of life they led, what was thetenour of their conversation; what exercises did theyfollow, and many other things that would suggest themselves, never wearying of conversing with him andenjoying his company. The friendships that are formedin the early years of study remain very firmly fixed, andare never forgotten. They dearly loved him, and he inhis turn reciprocated that affection; and despite that theywere men of grave pursuits, love made all these details tobe of interest.Those who had never seen or conversedwith him as they had, yet knew him by repute for hisgreat gifts, hastened to see him, to hear and conversewith him as with a miraculous being, and one and all heldRETURNS TO ROME231Rome to be fortunate indeed, and singularly blessed, thathad reared up so splendid a plant. Some praised him forhis sanctity and exterior modesty, a great index of aninterior soul.Others were in admiration of his eruditionand letters, others again lauded his great knowledge of avariety of tongues that he possessed, while others werestruck by his urbanity and polished manner, his courteousstyle, not appearing as a man who had dwelt among beastsbut amid the angels, for in truth the most polished man ofsociety would have judged Jerome to have spent his timein the study of good breeding. Rome is, and has alwaysbeen, the resort of all peoples and of singular intellects,owing to the fact that she is the centre of learningtowards which all nations turn. Rome was, under paganprinces who were the lords of the world, in the same wayas later on she altogether bent in submission to theVicars of Christ; hence in all ages in Rome could be foundall that was desirable of skill and genius and singulartalents.In the time of Damasus this concourse of talentwas seen in a more excellent and abundant manner; andfurthermore, owing to the meeting together of the variouschurches of the east and of the west, Rome was full to itsutmost capacity.Throughout the land was spread thereport of the coming of Jerome, the man so eminentlydistinguished for sanctity and doctrine. Every one desiredto see him, and all wished to measure words with him.Those who were dedicated to the study of the sacredwritings, when they conferred with him, judged that inthis study alone he must have spent his life, and that lifeseemed in truth too short to have acquired so muchknowledge.Such as were exercised in the spiritual lifeand accustomed to the highest contemplation, and to thebliss which in such moments the soul enjoys, when they conversed with him on the subject, felt the time speed on like a232THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEbird on the wing, because, from the great practice of this exercise the soul was deft in mounting high; yet they were inadmiration to see how much he had progressed in this kindof life, and to perceive in him so much experience in comparison of his age, for in acquiring much less experiencemany more years are required to attain to it.While thecounsels he gave on this subject, the craft of Satan which hewas wont to discover, the difficulty that exists in acquiringdiscernment of spirits (indeed the greatest known on earth),he would level down by enlightened reasoning gatheredfrom the gospels where they are scattered about with greatsubtlety and declared by the Lord Himself.Those whowere skilled in human letters and in good philosophy andother erudite studies, judged it were almost impossiblefor him to have done anything else from his birth butoccupy his whole time in these studies, and in this hisSuch as hadmarvellous memory was a great factor.a good knowledge of languages, especially of the Hebrewwhich he constantly had on his lips, declared as Jews,many of whom frequented Rome from the former captivities, that he must have been brought up in thesynagogue, and that, moreover, he must have drawn outits secrets from the most learned Rabbis. Those learnedin the purest Greek and Syriac marvelled much at thegreat propriety and the diction with which he handledtongues and dialects. Some would hold him to be anAthenian, others for a man of Jerusalem; such as followedthe study of antiquity and history, and who had spent theirtime in their research, could not be convinced that theknowledge which he possessed could have been acquiredby ordinary means.Yet, what caused most surprise andadmiration was to see him treating upon such arduousaffairs as were entrusted to him to carry through, or hadbeen communicated to him; it seemed in truth as thoughHIS POPULARITY IN ROME233he had compassed the whole of jurisprudence, and that hepossessed a deep experience of all schemes, issues,pleadings, and means for arranging and facilitating thelaw, with all the clearness and acumen of one accustomedto the curia and the forum.Such was the Jerome whom Rome now received.Such the delight his presence caused the learned men,since they desired to wrestle with him, see, and conversewith him. To such a degree did this reach that thematrons of greatest holiness of life, and most withdrawnfrom the world, felt that it was inexpedient for them to bedeprived of conversing with a man of such esteem, andthey sought to communicate with him. They vied withone another to tender their appreciation of him. Amongthese were not only ladies of wealth and position but ofgreat learning. These latter endeavoured, with saintlyemulation, to approach him, and were followed by those ofthe highest rank, until they overcame the bashfulness andretirement of the monk, for his religious life he never lostsight of on any occasion whatsoever, but followed it inRome in view of the whole world when all eyes were bentupon him. The holy Pontiff Damasus was overjoyed onbeholding this homage, and all the praise lavished on hisJerome from every quarter, and the wisdom whichemanated from his lips.It seemed to him that he hadgreatly aggrieved the Church by not sooner havingIn truth,brought forward such a mind for her service.the friendship, which by means of Epiphanius and Paulinushad been established with Jerome, added to the servicesthey had rendered him, was largely instrumental in securingthe satisfactory issue of these prelates' journey.Paulinusreturned confirmed in his bishopric, gratefully and insubjection to the holy See.Epiphanius quickly despatchedhis affairs, and the Pope gave orders for him to return to234THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEhis churches, he himself continuing with his new guest.Damasus clearly perceived that God had brought to hima great man, like to another Paul or Peter, in order that,at a time of so much business with heretics, as well as withthe Catholics themselves, he, in union with the Emperorand princes, should assist him.Acting, therefore, underthis impression, Damasus entrusted him with the gravestbusiness of his office, namely, the replying to all doubts,questions, difficulties, and controversies respecting thefaith, which should be sent for solution from all parts ofthe world to the apostolic See, as well as all othersrespecting good customs and appertaining to holy cereAlso was Jerome delegated to give court,monies.audience, and sentence on all difficulties and suits whichmight arise in the synods and provincial and nationalcouncils.As at that period great was the variety of nations inwhich the Church of Christ had been scattered, and manywere the errors that daily were springing up sown by theenemy in that celestial inheritance; many the noveltiesintroduced by men ambitious of making known their nameby good or evil means, and also because to men of saintlylife God had revealed things for the better adornment ofHis Church and her discipline, as well as for the explanation of the sacred Scriptures and the clearing up of certainpoints of the Catholic faith as were discussed in thesynods; from all which followed various contradictions andopinions, these as a consequence had to be submitted atonce to Rome for solution and sentence.All these dutiesdid the Pontiff impose on the saintly doctor, since all thathe had to reply was to be replied by Jerome, and this wasdone by impressing on these replies his authority, confirming and authorising with apostolic power; thus allthat passed by the judgment of Jerome was a sufficientASSISTS DAMASUS235act, and allthat would be required, as though thedecision had been approved by a full consistory ofcardinals.For thus did it appear to Damasus, that aman of so much learning and signal sanctity, endowedwith so vast a zeal for the honour and service of our Lord,and for the increase of the Catholic faith, was equal insound judgment to many; he being, so to say, a temple inhimself wherein dwelt the Holy Ghost, Who would by hismouth give forth divine oracles and answers, as in formertimes the vessel of election, companion in the apostleshipof St. Peter, had done.All this is meant and comprehended in those briefwords: “Reply for Damasus in the ecclesiastical letters”;and this is what is meant when he states that it was laidon him to reply to the synodal consultations that from theeast and the west were forwarded to Pope Damasus,which was to say, from all the Church; because in thesetwo words the whole was comprehended, according to thelanguage employed in those early days, similarly as St.Paul used to say “Jews and Greeks”" when he wished tosignify the whole world.Thus does the holy doctor manifest it when writing toGeruncia,” when in the course of the letter he says asfollows: “When living in Rome, now many years back, Izwas assisting Damasus, the bishop of that city, in the letterswhich were written for the government and establishment ofthe Churches, it having been entrusted to my charge to replyto the consultations of all the synodal councils of the east andof the west.”By this paragraph he clearly declares the office andcharge laid upon him by Damasus, and that he was hisonly counsellor, and of his secret council to the wholecabinet and its adviser. The same is confirmed againstRomans.Epist. 11.236THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe malice and calumny, or rather false testimony, Rufinusaccuses him of, although disguising his name. The casewas this. As he had been entrusted and charged withthe great work of giving the rules and drawing up theresolutions in respect to what the heretics were to confessand do, when submitting and coming to be reconciled withthe Church by subjecting themselves to the chair of St.Peter (this being in course of discussion by some of theApollinarist heretics), Damasus summoned for this effect asynod in Rome, as mentioned by Haymo in lib. x. of hisMemorials of Christian Things, and Theodoretus in lib. v.of his History, cap. ix.When the rule for the confession of faith which theApollinarists were to make had been drawn up, which saidrule had been arranged by our saint, as was his office todo, it was perceived he had put in a word that he judgedopportune to be set in the confession of faith respectingthe incarnation of our Redeemer, calling Him HomoDominicus.The Apollinarists were scandalised at thisterm, and reprobated the novelty of this manner of speech.Our saintly doctor being present at the time, proved tothem that many learned and saintly doctors had employedthe term, and that they had no cause to reprehend him orcall it a new thing, and ordered the works of St. Athanasiusto be brought before him, and showed them that heemployed the same manner of speech and self-same wordwhich they had objected to. They cunningly besought himto lend the volume in order to peruse it, and confuteothers with it, if perchance they should judge it wrong.He gave up the volume without suspecting the malicethey had at heart. When the book was returned he foundthat the portion referred to had been scratched out, inorder that no authority of St. Athanasius should be foundfor the two words Homo Dominicus. Over the portionTHE APOLLINARISTS237scratched out they had again written the said words, sothat when the text should be again sought for they shouldbe able to allege that this had been added on by Jerome,Once, being at supper, St. Jeromenot by St. Athanasius.recounted the episode to his friend Rufinus. From thisRufinus took occasion to show that in the book of Origenthe heretics had introduced many things, or he had doneso, and the books were falsified, a thing which had neverpassed Jerome's mind to do. This case is maliciouslybrought forward by Rufinus as a testimony and proof,accusing the saint and alleging that it would be cruel notto believe this to have been the fact in the books ofOrigen, where he had exercised much diligence in discovering the malice of the Apollinarists, and infers that ifthere are evils in the books of Origen and heresies, asJerome says, that it was in this way that they were introIn order to come to this he commences with theseduced.“Damasus, bishop,words, which are to our purpose.having to resolve and deliberate on the manner howto receive the Apollinarists, charged a priest, a greatfriend of his, a most learned man, to whom he haddictate and draw up theentrustedConfession of Faith which the Apollinarists were toThen follows the above-saidsubscribe to and sign.”Statement.these affairs, toWhat has been said suffices for our purpose, and weTherefore, returning to it, weshall continue our history.find our saint in Rome, burthened with occupations andgrave matters, set up in the pinnacle of high opinion andreputation, that, were it any one else but Jerome, he wouldassuredly have lost his head.Meanwhile that he is thus occupied, it appertains tohistory, and even a principal part of it, to examine what1 Rufin. in Fine Apol. pro Origen, ad Machar.238THE LIFE OF ST.

These gifts do notmake the holders saints, nor just men, nor friends of God,nor perfect men, in proof of which do we see many placedin high dignities who have God very far from them, andwithdrawn from their hearts, and they only have from Godthe dignity they exercise.Let Judas be an example (soas not to quote others nearer our time) in apostolicdignity, elected by Christ Himself, yet who presently putHim up to barter, an ungrateful, wicked and disloyal man,and accepted the price of his perfidy, money which proved23924O| THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEhis ruin.After him there have followed such a crowd,that even the very thought is enough to make one shudderand grieve the soul. What makes men saints and thefriends of God, and sets man above the stars, is the spiritof sanctifiation, the planting of the divine gift in thesoul, which St. James calls perfect and excellent, whichcarries in its train a great abundance of riches, distributedas it pleases Him and as He wills.Of this gift of sanctification a great portion fell to ourDoctor, as from the narrative we have already traced canbe perceived of his life, and which God communicated tohim in full; but from this point to which we have come,the fact will be more clearly and forcibly seen of thewonderful treasures of grace granted to him. “Open thymouth and thou shalt be filled.”Or, as in commonparlance is expressed, that his mouth was his measure.And thus does it occur to such as follow the service ofGod in truth, and who cast themselves into it withdetermined hearts, confiding chivalrously in His bounty;as, for example, the labourers of the New Testament, who,without being equal, despite that in the last hour theywent to labour in the vineyard, and even for this veryreason were paid the first.All things came to Jerome at the request of his mouthin these kinds of gifts; those others who are of the outside proceed by another way. And it is the will of Godthat dignities and ministries of the Church, forasmuch asthey are holy, should be held by saintly ministers; andwhen he permits the reverse it is as a particular punishThe saints are confirmed in them, and remainment.authoritatively apportioned to them, and their persons areesteemed on account of their dignities, and with them theywin over souls when their lives correspond to their offices;and to the contrary, they lose all if each pulls his wayCREATED A CARDINAL24Iuntil there remains constructed a monster more strangethan the chimera of the dialecticians and of the poets.Respect is lost to the dignity, and they are disdained anddespised; the person is scorned, and all things areperverted.It is clear that the Chair of the Supreme Pontificateclaims respect, and men reverence it when they see itoccupied by a St. Gregory and a Leo I., and hundreds ofothers of that kind; while, to the contrary, the dignitybecomes lowered when filled by one who is a victim to hisambition, to his passions and low appetites.

IoI.ANTIQUITY OF THE CARDINALATE243convened by St. Silvester (should no other proof exist), inCanon 6, it is clearly stated that there were seven cardinaldeacons in the Roman Church, and neither the title noroffice was invented in that Council, for it was a thingestablished long before, as an ancient thing; and in thisCouncil it is simply ordained that, besides three cardinaldeacons of the Church of Rome, there should be otherdeacons appointed for the examination of the parishes.From this, then, let those be convinced who say that in thetime of St. Jerome no such number of cardinals existed, aswell as those who affirm that this name is not more ancientthan from the time of St. Gregory, and that even then thebishops held this name, because as often as cardinals werenamed no mention was made of those of the Roman Church,but of others, hence it was no more to say cardinal priestthan to say bishop.Both these statements are fallacies,and far removed from the truth, as will be apparent to anyone.From the same Council, as regards the first, thecontrary is proved, as we have seen, and with regard toSt. Gregory, it is made manifest, in lib. v. letter 11 toFortunatus, Bishop of Naples, where mention is made ofthe cardinal deacons, and in lib. xi. letter 34 mention is madeof cardinal priests.John, deacon, in lib. iii. of the Lifeof St. Gregory, gives the number of bishops whom the saintconsecrated cardinal priests.Polidorus Virgilius' saysthat this office and dignity had its commencement infather, a native ofSt. Evaristus, a Greek, and hisBethlehem, in the year 112 after the birth of our Lord,because he was the first who divided the offices, I meanthe titles to the priests, and constituted, on the exampleFollowing Evaristus,of the apostles, seven deacons.later on Dionysius and Marcellus Popes imitated him, byenlarging on this; for thus does Damasus describe it, and1 Polid.

JEROMEOthers agree with Polidorus.later on still, Platina.Asto what he subsequently adds, that in the time of St.Jerome, although the office existed there was not that grandname attached to it of cardinal, he is greatly mistaken,as we have seen, because the name and the office comefrom undoubtedly farther back, and as we touched upon,the ministry of cardinals descends from the apostles, andthe view of the authors who agree with Polidorus in the firstis confirmed by a letter of St. Ignatius to the Italians whereinhe says as follows: “What else is the priesthood buta holy institution of conciliators (conciliarios) and confessorsof the bishops.” Many know what Raphael Volaterranus’also tells us of some ancient tablets which he found in theChurch of Arezzo, on which was inscribed a donation madeby Zenobius, a Roman senator, to the Church itself in thetime of Damasus, where occurs the following superscriptionand approbation: Et Ego Joan, S. R. E. Diaconus Cardinalis ex parte Damasi Pontificis laudo et confirmo.Should we desire to carry this argument on to its endand investigate the origin of the word cardinal, it would notbe easy to find the root and principle.Some, indeed nearlyall, reduce it to the Greek term which means carata, fromwhence was derived the Latin cor, which is the heart, becausethe heart is the seat and principle of life; this in truth isnot at variance with the dignity and office of cardinals, sincethese are close to the principle and seat of the Church,from whence must come forth, through her council, the vitalspirit which has to govern the whole of her body.Let us proceed to examine what is the office and thepoints of its ministry. To my mind these points are three.First, what is common to bishops, priests, and deacons,1 Guido Archid. in Commen. in sextum JurisPontific.Francis Zabarellus.Raymundus Rufus contra Molinum.Volat. lib. 22, Antrop.ANTIQUITY OF THE CARDINALATE245because the one who is to be raised to the cardinalate musthold one of these three offices.Secondly, the right andcharge of electing the supreme pontiff; and the third andchief office, and the one most difficult, is that of being ofthe conclave and council of the Pope, to give his opinionalways whensoever it be necessary, and always to theadvantage of the Church without any human respect,although by so doing he should lose his life. No onedoubts that these three offices are of very ancient origin,and that they have come down in perpetual action fromthe apostles.But it is not a custom of very great antiquity,although now in use, for cardinals alone to make electionof Popes, and for them alone to assist at the council and theForasmuch as ingeneral government of the Church.early times there were but few priests and deacons, allgathered together to the election who were summoned toNor was there any necessitythe assemblies and councils.to distinguish cardinals from those that were not cardinals,similarly as in the other Churches the canons were notdistinguished from the non-canons.From this in a brief manner is made manifest theantiquity, name, purpose, and office of cardinals, and thatit dates far before the time of St. Jerome, and as a consequence is deduced from his own words what has beenadvanced that the saintly doctor had been cardinal priestof Rome.And the reason is manifest. A man whowas so beloved by Damasus, and in whom he so fullytrusted (indeed to whom he trusted everything), of whomthe saint himself said that Damasus did nothing, nor saidanything, but what he ordered, in the following words:*“Damasus, of blessed memory, was nothing more than whatI said.” What less could he do than confer on him thisdignity? A man upon whom all eyes in the city of RomeEpist. 99, ad Asell.246THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwere turned, of whom it was publicly said that, afterSt. Damasus, he would succeed to the chair of theSupreme Pontiff, as one most worthy of it, for he himselfwas aware of this, since in the same epistle we find thesewords: “All the votes and wishes of the city concurred in me,and by the judgment and approbation of all worthy of thesupreme priesthood.” What possible doubt could thereexist that he had been created a cardinal?It is as clearas the sun.Moreover, in those days nearly always werethe popes elected from among cardinals, and Damasushimself had been a cardinal, as is asserted by Onophrius.To Jerome alone had been entrusted to answer all doubtsthat arose in the synods or were sent to them for solution;he had been charged by the same Damasus to draw upthe form and order of procedure which heretics whocame to be reconciled were to follow, and what they wereto confess and to abjure, and can it be called in questionwhether he was a cardinalIt is manifest that whateveroffices cardinals were called upon to fulfil, he had heldThat Jerome was a priest is proved, and itthem all.was no impediment that he had been ordained in Antiochto be priest of Rome, for Pope Damasus had need ofsuch a man of importance to act for him juridically and withgreater advantage to himself, a thing he could better dowhen invested with the dignity of cardinal, so that in thecouncils and assemblies his vote should carry authority,This dignityand this alone would be a sufficient reason.enabled him to be in the government of ecclesiasticalaffairs, and to be also the counsellor of the Pope (which isthe proper office and ministry of cardinals), all this wasverified in Jerome, for not only did he do this, similarly asother cardinals, but it, moreover, appears that he was alone,and had been invested with the whole charge, and, as itwere, he was the pivot and hinge upon which all thingsINSIGNIA OF A CARDINAL247depended. That he was present at, and took part in, theelection of the Pope I have clear evidence, since at thedeath of Damasus (for he died before Jerome left Rome)he voted in the election of Siricius, who was chosen atonce, and to his vote must have been in great part due hiselection to the Chair.Hence he exercised all the offices,and in all that constitutes being a cardinal he was first.There now remains the third point—the dress—theinsignia of the purple in the robe and in the hat. Tosuch as say that it is an absurdity to depict St. Jerome inthem, we reply that it is ignorance to suppose that theseare of recent introduction, and dates no farther back thanthe times of Benedict VIII. That these are new in regardto St. Jerome I acknowledge; but they are in error toascribe them to the time of Benedict, since it standsproved by hundreds of authors that Innocent IV., aboutthe year 1254, ordered in the Council of Lyons thatcardinals should wear the pileus (red hat), which is the capor hat which in Castilian is called sombrero, of red colour,and that they should ride palfrey horses. Thus is it relatedto us by Volaterranus, Onophrius Genebrardus, MartinPolonius, and others.In doing this the Pope not onlywished to confirm the dignity and distinguish it, but alsoto signify by it that should it be necessary to lay downlife and limb and shed blood for the Church, by fightingfor her, the office held by the cardinal would compel himThat period of history was a time when thisto do so.was not unusual, on account of the great persecution whichthe Emperor Frederick II. was waging on the Church.Subsequently, in the year 1464, Paul II., who was aVenetian (the last of whom Platina writes about, and fromwhom he experienced many trials), on account of havingto appear in public ceremonials with much pomp and glory,1 Volat. lib. 22, Onoph. in Pal. Genebr. in Cronet.248THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEand not wishing to seem as though he alone desired todistinguish himself, added much to the pageantry in theapparel of the cardinals. He first ordered, under heavypenalties, that none should wear the red hat or scarletbut the cardinals, and that the robes, apparel, and thetrappings of the horses should be of the same colour;hence all this ornateness and colouring dates only fromthis epoch, which was a thousand years after St. Jerome,and therefore they say it is quite out of place to paint orI saydepict him robed in all the insignia of a cardinal.that they would have reason for this objection if thelicence of painters were a new thing and peculiar to thiscase, and were there not an infinite number of things ofthis kind accepted. Who doubts that cardinals, bishops,cardinal priests, and deacons had some robe or distinctivesign by which they were distinguished from the others,more especially when they exercised their offices in theChurch? As for myself, I hold it as certain. But grantedthat, on account of the simplicity of the early times, theydid not exist, at least when the numbers increased and theauthority and dignity were established no one will deny thatthe dress existed.Let us admit that it was not so. Howcan we now depict them when all the dignities have theirdistinctive robes, such as lived in those remote ages (whono doubt were about the same), to such as only read withthe eyes according to what they see in use in the churches?How can the masses to whom pictures are of great useknow that St. Peter was pope, St. Stephen and St. Lawrence deacons, St. Ambrose and St. Augustine bishops,unless by depicting them according to their rank and inthe emblems of their dignities?Forsooth, in the time ofSt. Peter were there tiaras and mitres such as he is depictedwith now? Were there, perchance, in the time of St.Stephen dalmatics, albs, girdles, as we are shown; or evenINSIGNIA OF A CARDINAL249in the time of St. Lawrence, less than 300 years later? Arethey, forsooth, improperly depicted? That men who areheretics should question this because they are not pleasedat any distinction of the Church, not even the pictures ofthe saints, I can understand, but the faithful have no reasonfor so doing.Hence, as St. Jerome in those early daysfilled the same office as is discharged in our days bycardinals, it is quite proper that he should be depictedclothed in the same robes, in order that all should understand the rank he held in the Church.From which alsois seen how well established it was in all hearts that St.Jerome was a cardinal, since as soon as the Popes hadportioned out their insignia to the cardinals he was vestedin them, as is proved by the ancient pictures of the saintthroughout the world.Without any manner of doubt the insignia of the officefit him well, and none better; and despite the authorsalready quoted should not have afforded us another reasonfor cardinals being invested in galerus, petesus, or capellusof wide brim and of a red colour, but to signify that theyhad to lay down their life and limb for Jesus Christand His Church; yet I believe there were many otherconsiderations and motives for this insignia, which hasalready been made the device of cardinals, and in anespecial manner of St. Jerome, for on seeing a capellus inan escutcheon men at once recognise it as his arms andIn order to signify what has been said, any sortdevice.of red cap would suffice, but to make a hat of such extensivebrim, straight and wide, which greatly resembles the wand(caduceus) of Mercury (supposed by the ancients to be themessenger of the gods), was not done without judgmentand reflection. Without doubt it was the most skilled andsignificative device which could be given to cardinalswith the object of signifying to them the obligations25oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEof the office, and that they should read them in theirhats.The ancients supposed that Mercury was the messengerbetween the gods and men, and that he came and wentwith their messages, and arranged treaties of peace and gaveadvice. They put wings on his shoes, and in his hand awand in which two serpents were twined, on his head the£alerus of large lappets and two wings. Putting aside whatprofane writers may say concerning this, I will confinemyself to what concerns our purpose, by saying that allthis fits well to all prelates and all such as hold the officeof mediators between God and men, and with greateradvantages and propriety to the cardinals.These, like tosuch as have wings to their feet, are not to plant them onthe ground: their affections must be well lifted up, theirfootsteps very swift for the things of heaven, because forthe things of the world there is no need of wings; theforce of gravity itself of the human heart presses downand bends towards earth.It is necessary that they shouldrise from earth with light wings, and say with the apostle(whom some have called Mercury), “Our conversation isin heaven.” On the head is set the large capellus, becauseit is in the brain that reason has its seat, and it is meetthat it should be well guarded and strengthened; becauseif this part be not in health the man is no longer man.The part that is most noble, called mind, mente, or mens(from whence some nations derive the name of man, callinghim mensch, which means a thing which governs itself),must have the capellus, in order to comprehend that, onhaving this part guarded and safe, the whole man remainsfree of the ailments and the sicknesses which disturb thewhole scheme of the due government of human life,and likewise also, that thereby they should be known as1 Actor.A TOKEN OF PEACE251being Mercuries between God and the rest of men, theiroffice being to declare the divine will to mortals.Suchshould be the men upon whose head is placed the red hat,the token and insignia of peace, for without first knowingthe divine will, and they themselves carrying it out bydeeds, it is impossible they should attain to it.It is saidthat Mercury' would descend flying, and perch first onsome high mountain, and from thence come down to men.Similarly does the royal Prophet sing, “Let the mountainsreceive peace for the peoples.” These are the high mountains of the Church, the cardinals and pastors, whereuponpeace must first be planted, and a channel down whichthousands of gifts are to descend from heaven, enclosedAll to be effected at the cost ofall within this peace.their blood and their life, since this is what is declared bythe red hat.It would be simply superfluous to enlargeon how fittingly all this apparel suits our glorious doctor;and this is what it is to be a cardinal (for in truth it isnothing else), and I do not know whether there has livedany cardinal to equal him.”Great and precious pearls, diamonds, and rubies hasthe Church possessed among her princes in this dignity,by which she has remained beautiful and robed in celestialapparel, because, despite that numerically they have notbeen many, yet it is a subject of marvel the greatness andmultitude of renowned men who have come forth fromthat college: but few of these can equal St. Jerome;none surpass him, none with greater propriety can morefittingly wear the insignia—energetic in the cause of theChurch and her defence, exponent of the divine will,a great counsellor, and now mediator between Godand man.Virgil, 4 Azneid.Cardinalis Paleotus, lib. De consuta Consib.com. ult ment. 3.BOOK THE FOURTH.FIFTH AGE-MANHOOD, VIRILITY253PROEMIN order to understand the excellence of this age, itsuffices to see that man, when he arrives at the perfectionof his being, is called by the name of man. Or if we wishto express it, as dialecticians say, “a priori,” this statewhich constitutes the best of his manhood is called virility,from “vir.” The Hebrew language, which is the motherof all languages, possesses four names by which in thesacred writings man is signified to us. The first is Adam,the second Enó, the third Guióor, the fourth As; and allthese names have a particular meaning, showing us someone thing in the state of man. The name Adam putsbefore us the matter from which he was formed, a maddercoloured earth, or reddish, and the word in Latin, “homo,”from humus, is rightly well used, which answers to this, itHoly Scripture alwaysmeans to say a “thing of earth.”employs this word whenever it wishes to signify the stateto which man degenerated after the sin, according to St.Paul: the first man was of earth, earthly; and in order tosignify to us a thing opposed to God, according to thattext of the Prophet, Egypt, man and not God. Of thathappy first state in which God created man no particularterm has remained to us. The second, which is Enó, isthe same as in the vernacular, and what in Latin is termedmortal, signifies what is “sickly, weak, fragile, miserable”;thus we see the inheritance of Adam, its name, and the255256THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEfirst man.In this sense is found the term Enó, accordingto the words of Job: “War and fighting is the life ofEnó, of the mortal man upon earth,” and similarly in aGuibor comes as the third name,number of other places.and means “strong, robust, powerful, and eminent,” whetherin wealth, strength, ability, skill; according to the Psalm,Quique terrigena, et filii, hominum simul in unum dives et£auper, thus calling ordinary people and men terrigena,and to the great and powerful filii Guiborim. The lastname is Is, and by this is signified what is excellent andexcelling in man, virility, as though we should say, theefficiency of all that be most perfect in him, and the sameas is expressed in Latin by the word vir, and in CastilianBoth terms in Latin and in Hebrew indicateby varon.all that is truly manly and masculine, in contradistinctionto what is feminine.In order that we may well understand the divine letters, it is of no small importance for usto remember the distinction between these four names,which oftentimes, without distinction, is expressed by oneonly word, man, although the significations are so distinct,and as a consequence the sense is varied. Which interpretation never will be apprehended except by those whohave had some knowledge of the holy language.Intothis age of Is, that of manhood, did our doctor now enter.But yet he must have been well advanced in its perfectionof manhood, because, according to our computation, whenhe came to Rome he must have entered the thirty-sixth orthirty-seventh year of his age, the full-grown age, whereinhe will nobly manifest the fulness of his age by hisfortitude, his constancy, his virtue, his excellence; for allthese qualities are presupposed and enclosed in what wecall manhood or virility.Cicero says that from this name of vir is derived thename of “virtue,” because it is what most beautifies andPROEM257elevates man.This term virtue in man comprehends allthat there is of good and of greatness in man; it impliesprudence,modesty,temperance,magnanimity, constancy, and integrity in all encountersand difficulties, and many other virtues.rectitude,fortitude,Right well, indeed, will our saint at this age manifestto us all the above-said attributes, and even other moreheroic and lofty virtues; grandly will he show his virility,and that he is truly of cardinal and venerable dignity.High dignities will not alter him, for, generally speaking,dignities reveal the man. So long as a man leads aretired, private life, he can easily dissimulate and hide hisinclinations, his genius, or his habits; but when he comesforth to high position, his strength and his powers run arace with his desires and inclinations, and in that crucibleis proved the refined gold.It has been well said that dignities change a manand manifest what he is and his ways of life.And ofSt. Jerome we may truly say more, viz., that the dignitymanifested how great he was, and he himself illustratedhow grand is the dignity, because it did not make himdiminish a single point in his sanctity, in his rigorouspenance and severity with himself; and he was in Romeas cardinal what he was in Syria as a monk; while heexemplified what was in truth the dignity of cardinal, towhat noble virtues it obliges him who takes the dignity.Virtue and virility is signified by the growth of beard, inthe common acceptation of all nations which are cultured;and though the beard grows in youth, it yet never attainsperfection until manhood. Hence, for this reason, it is mybelief that our Jerome is always depicted with a longbeard, in order that we should understand that he neverdeclined from his noble state of manhood and of virtue.Plutar. in Vita Cicer.Plutus, in Praeceptis civilibus de Epimacho.S258THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEIt is related of the cynic Diogenes that he never allowedhis beard to be shorn, declaring that he wore it long inorder to be ever reminded that he was a man, and that itwas as unbecoming for a man to clip it as for a lion tohave its mane shorn off.David would not permit hisambassadors to appear before him beardless who had beenshaven by Ammon Ammonita, until their beards should havegrown again; because, according to Eucherius, it signified(besides ignorance) that they had returned without virtue,without strength, and without valour. And thus does ithappen to such as leave the path of virtue through someunworthy motive or deceit of the devil, that they degenerate from their former state of manliness, and renderthemselves unworthy of appearing in the presence of God.All this is far removed from Jerome; no encounter willmake him fall, nor will he lose a single hair of his beard,despite all the warfare which the enemy may wage againsthim. We may safely place our greatest confidence in him,for never did he allow his beard to be shorn, nor was anyone ever to take a part in despoiling him (since it isdangerous to attempt to clip a lion that is wide awake),and never will he be denied to enter the presence of God.. Let us, then, in this fourth book of his life, and moreleisurely, consider and reveal him as a grand man inthe Church which he adorned so highly, and defendedas a valorous, strong, and robust man, excelling all byhis great skill.DISCOURSE THE FIRSTSt. Jerome establishes the Order of Divine Worship inRome, and draws up the Holy Ceremonies of theChurch. He prescribes the “Alleluia” to be sung inthe Roman Liturgy.ALTHOUGH St. Jerome had so much occupation in Romefulfilling the offices of cardinal and chancellor, neverthelesshe so thoroughly discharged the duties relating to hissacred priesthood and ministry that it would seem he hadnaught else to attend to.I do not wish in this discourseto treat of those duties which related to him as Doctor ofthe Church, but only of those labours which, as a goodpriest, he fulfilled, leaving aside all others for futurediscourses.It seems impossible that one man could haveattended to so much, and have done so many thingsI believe it was because, aswith such thoroughness.his food was scanty, his allotted time for sleep so short, hehad time for what would appear no time could be enough.He said mass very frequently, and with all the devotionand fervour which can be imagined in so saintly a soul.Our Lord during these performances gave him greatlights for all things, and favoured him with many gracesand favours, as His Divine Majesty is wont to do onbehalf of such like servants of His, who, fully aware ofwhat they are called to do, prepare first their soul, most25926oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEearnestly awaiting the coming of so great a Bridegroom.And as the reverence for, and fear of, so much majestyabsorbs their minds, turning their eyes totheir ownlittleness and vileness, they empty themselves of all thatthey have within them, so that nothing should embarrassthem, in order that such royal eyes be not offendedHence, when Heand their capacity be not curtailed.enters these, He enriches them with His presence,and leaves them replete with His gifts.In this waydo saints grow in grace; in this way are they madeso great that, compared with them, the rest bear no proportion whatever; as the astrologers say that the earthbears no comparison with the heavens, similarly do thesemen of heaven bear an immeasurable advantage to worldlyones.This kept our saint in a continual guard in allthings—custody of the eyes, great prudence and consideration in his words, his intercourse and conversation.He feared lest there should enter in by these windows,unless well guarded, what in the time of need wouldsuffice to close the gates to the coming of God. Thusdid he himself express it in the Epitaph of Marcella:“A proceeded with great modesty in my eyes, in order not to/ook on the Roman matrons.”It is a very difficult matter that the images of thingsseen which remain impressed in the soul, should notobstruct or intervene at the time when the priest needsto be gazing so closely upon Christ; and it is a greatdeceit and dangerous presumption to trust to one's self,and make so little account of God, as to think that Hewill establish in them His dwelling, and work the effectswhich from His corporeal presence is assumed, theythemselves doing nothing on their part to warrant such ahope; for they have thought it of small moment that theEpist. 16.ORDER OF DIVINE WORSHIP261dwelling should be well guarded and prepared for Hiscoming, nor even when He is within (which is worse) dothey linger a moment to thank Him for His coming, norto ask of Him those mercies which they might haveobtained by some of these efforts. And the truth of allthis is apparent to many of us; for, after many years'enjoyment of these great benefits, we find ourselves buriedin the deepest poverty. Nor can I persuade myself thatso great a treasure, if it were within, could possibly remainso concealed that it should of itself afford so few or noproofs of its dwelling there.It is impossible that a brightfire, so many times multiplied, should not warm and shedits radiance on all objects around—that so brilliant alight should not diffuse a reflection, for this is its principaleffect, and the sun itself does not wish to be obscured, butthat it should be seen by its works and effects, and glorybe given to the Father of the light which is in the heavens,and be declared, “This is the chaste generation which theLord has blessed.” This was seen in St. Jerome, whocame forth from that sacred banquet “like a lion dartinggleams of fire from his mouth” (for thus does St.Chrysostom declare of good communicants), turning forthe divine honour, appalling to devils, unbearable to theIn memory of this and as most precious relics andbad.of great esteem does the city of Rome preserve the chalicein which St. Jerome consecrated, and it is shown to thepeople with great reverence, together with the chasublewhich he wore.Perchance this may be the same chasublewhich was sent to him by his great friend Nepotian,nephew of Heliodorus, when at the point of death, as aprecious legacy in proof of his friendship.The sainthimself says in the epitaph which he subsequently wroteupon him, and dedicated to the said uncle: “Tears are1 Marianus, in Vita P. Hieronymi.262THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEcoursing down my cheeks, and despite that I wish toresist them with the Spirit, I cannot disguise the sorrowI feel. Who would have thought that Nepotian, placed atthe point of death, should have remembered my friendship? and that his soul, being in agony, should not haveforgotten the sweetness of our desire? And taking thehand of his uncle, he said: ‘This chasuble which I used inthe holy ministry of the altar of Christ, send it to mybeloved, in age my father, and in office my brother, andby all the affection that you bear to your nephew, passit on to him whom you love on an equality with me.’Saying these words he swooned away, grasping the handof his uncle and bearing me in his memory.” He was inan extreme manner tender towards his friends; and itseemed as friend after friend departed, that he himselfexpired with each, and their memory was always presentwith him. He was skilful in handling all things that wereunder his care and that appertained to the divine worship,keeping them all scrupulously clean. He considered thatthe church was the palace of the most exalted of kings,and the table that of the greatest of lords. He well knewthe respect described in the Old Testament for the holyof holies, which was no more than the shadow of thesepresent things, and he judged that all diligence was all toolittle. He could not endure those who on this point werecareless and without decorum, and thereforeto thecontrary he experienced great delight when he foundany one who excelledthese matters; he greatlyadmired this same priest Nepotian for this quality ofcircumspection and carefulness in his office.inIn the same Epistle” he says a little above: “Incomparison to what we have said little can I add; but inEpist. 3, c. 6, ad Heliod.Epist. 3, c. 5.ORDER OF DIVINE WORSHIP263small things is made manifest the inclination and thespirit.Because in the same manner as we judge theCreator admirable, not only in the heavens and on theearth, in the sun and in the ocean, in the elephant, camel,horses, buffaloes, tigers, bears, and lions, so also in thesmaller form of the animal kingdom—such as the ant, thefly, the caterpillar, and insects and grubs, which we knowbetter by their forms than by their names, and examiningeach we are struck with admiration and reverence at theskill of the Great Artificer, so also does the soul that istruly dedicated to Christ, careful of what is great andwhat is small, because it knows that even of one idleword it will have to give an account.Therefore he wascareful that the altar should be very clean, that there beno speck of dust on the walls, that the floor be well swept;the doorkeeper to assist at the doors and watch assiduously,that the tabernacle and sacristy be properly cleaned, thevessels thoroughly washed, and all the ceremonies performed with pious solicitude and diligence. He did notneglect either the greatest or the smallest office; and whenever you sought for him you would always find him in thechurch.The side chapels in the church, the sepulchresand altars of the martyrs, he would adorn with a varietyof flowers, branches, the fresh green shoots of the vine, sothat the whole was decorated with loving care and by thelabour of his hands.I have inserted this here, not onlybecause in itself it breathes all that is fresh, beautiful, andcomely, and that we may see what was the care and piousinclination our saint had towards all these things (which intruth was my purpose), but that in passing we shouldconsider how impious are those who reprehend all theysee in the church of holy ceremonies and ornamentation,saying that all these things are novelties and of littleFeré omnes haeretici à Vigilantiousque ad impium Kemnicium.264THE LIFE OF ST.

He had also observed that in the churches ofJerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and others the “Alleluia”Pontiffwas sung, and he therefore pleaded with theTHE ‘ALLELUIA’ IN THE LITURGY265Damasus that it should likewise be sung in Rome.St.Gregory the Great, in the Seventh Book of his Epistles,in the Epistle 65 to John, Bishop of Zaragoza, in Sicily,replying to the objections of some who deemed themanner of celebrating mass incorrect, on coming tothe “Alleluia,” says: “The singing of the Alleluia is acustom taken from the church of Jerusalem, according tothe tradition and teaching of St. Jerome, since the time ofSt. Damasus, Pope, for thus is it affirmed by all.” Bythese words St. Gregory manifested the great authority inwhich St. Jerome was held, and of what great value wasthe tradition which he had taught, and which had beenhanded down to his time.The reason which moved the holy doctor to introducethe chant of the “Alleluia” into the Latin Church was, Ibelieve, not so much the desire that it should be similarto that of Jerusalem, where it had been taught by theApostle St. James, and appears in his liturgy, nor that theHebrew and Greek words should resound in the Roman,as on account of the lofty mystery which he was wellaware was enclosed in those two terms, a Hebrew nameand verb “Allelu-ia.”A great deal was revealed concerning this word whenhe wrote to the noble matron Marcella, who had asked himwhat meaning there was in some of the Hebrew words,such as “Alleluia,” “Amen,” Maranatha Ephod. He tellsher that allelu-ia is equal to praise be to God, because thatlast part, ia, is in Hebrew one of the ten divine namesemployed by those who speak the language.In anotherEpistle to the same,” he declares Ia to be interpreted bythe name of God. And when expounding those words ofIsaiah, chapter xxvi., In Domino Deo forti in perpetuum,says that in Hebrew there are three names of God, the firstEpist. 137, ad Marcel.Epist. 136, ad Marcel.266THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEis Ia, the second Jehovah, the third Zuria. He says that thefirst part of Allelu-ia signifies invisible, the second ineffable,the third means robust. And in an Epistle, which is foundamong his works, written to Damasus, a very good reasonis given, which, despite that the Epistle does not seemhis, yet the argument is like to the saint's, that when weseek to praise God Incarnate with our voice, Alleluia isadded to the Psalm; and forasmuch as our doctor' affordsus so often occasion to declare his motives, it will not beforeign to this purpose to add here something concerningthe mystery which is enclosed in the Alleluia. That nameso intimate and celebrated with the Hebrews of Jehovah,which through mystery and excellence is called by themIneffable and nomen expositum, and among the Greekstetragamaton, that is to say, of four letters, is called bythem ineffable, not because, as some have said, they thinkthat by it God is called as He is in Himself, because Godhas no name nor is there a symbol in all that is created,to embrace or comprehend what is a greatness withoutlimits.It is true to say that all other names by which God isnamed He Himself has communicated to His creatures,angels and men; and that this one formed of the said fourletters He has reserved for Himself; and this, not becauseit is so intimately His own, that it expresses what God is,but for other reasons.The simple reason of callingHimself Ineffable is because up to the present time it hasnot been written, nor can the manner of pronouncingit be properly written, nor is there a way in thedivine letters, because the four with which it is writtenare not letters, which are pronounced singly among theHebrews, but only by some differences of drawing the lips,to breathe in the air, and with the dots which were subse1 Apud Mar. 9, t. in tertia serie.THE *ALLELUIA’ IN THE LITURGY267quently added, to breathe out the same—a thing which fewof those who know Hebrew recognise.From the observance of the holy Scriptures is gatheredthat when this name is met with in them it signifies Godas a nature of eternal substance and essence, constant,invariable, of a most firm mercifulness, and that what Hepromises of good and salutary (to which He is mostinclined by will) cannot even be deficient, nor be hinderedby any circumstance whatever.This is what the ineffablename of Jehovah expresses, which name, although we mayso pronounce it, is not its proper sound.It becomes opportune to say this here, in order that we should understandthat God gave this name to the children of Israel as amilitary countersign, a token or symbol, as a watchwordamong them by which they should be known, like theword given as a password to the armies in their watches,because as it had been promised to that people, anddeclared to them His will, a thing He never had done toother nations; whensoever they called upon God underthat name, they always named Him the God of thePromises, and whereas others have spoken of this, I cometo my purpose.Of this name the two first letters are t, a, and standthe last in the said word Alleluia ; and when in thedivine letters the name ia is placed in the praises of God,it gives us to understand not only God of the Promises butGod who has fulfilled them, and carried them to due effectand the desired point; and not as God who fulfilled themwith a people and nation to whom had been given thename as a countersign, but as God and Lord so magnificent and generous in fulfilling what He promises, that Hehas extended them to the whole world, to all peoples, andto all nations, and to all dwelling in the heavens and onthe earth, so that all should praise and laud Him, acknow268THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEHence, when inledge and glorify and adore Him.church is said Alleluia, itis with extreme brevity todeclare Praise the Lord, which is His name, essence, andbeing. He Who promised His salvation and His treasuresof good to one only nation, and brought them to a mosthappy fulfilment, and extending all these for the benefitof all men, and of all creatures that exist in heaven andon earth. And praising God and man, as said our saint,is nothing else but to laud the One Who, havingpromised to become man for the good of mankind, filledall things with His divine gifts, fulfilling with excess whatHe had promised.In order that it be seen how clearly this is manifest inthe sacred writings, let it be recognised in the first place,that it will not be found in all the Books of Moses, unless Ihave not examined them aright, that this name Ia is onceeven mentioned, yet in the Psalms it is inserted many times;this was as though to tell us that what had been given tothe people by Moses, as regards what related to law andceremony, was not what God had promised man, nor whatHe had intended to give them, nor would it stop here.Itwas no more than a shadow of the body and reality of whatBut in the Psalms, forasmuch as they arewas promised.prophesies which sing of things as seen and executed,constant and eternal, the word Ia is repeated.Furthermore, let it be considered that when the name is set in thePsalms it always speaks to the multitude of nations andpeoples, and not alone to the people of Israel.In thePsalm Laudate Dominum omnes gentes, laudate eum omnespopuli, it ends with Allelu-ia; because it contains naught elsein the whole argument but what we have said. The sameoccurs in Psalm cii., after having said: Scriòantur hac ingeneratione altera, there is added and the people that shallObserve also the Psalm cii., which&e created, Alleluia.THE ‘ALLELUIA’ IN THE LITURGY269commences, Laudate pueri Dominum, where in the epilogueis said He who maketh a barren woman to dwell in thehouse a joyful mother of children, Allelu-ia, and in manymore of its kind.Hence, in view of the aforesaid, came truly fromHeaven the inspiration and the motive our saint had forthe Roman Church to sing what was so in keeping withherself, and from thence to spread throughout the world,as though from head to foot, the singing of this chant ofjoy, and not keep it enclosed solely in Jerusalem wherethe apostle had first ordered it should be sung. To thatpeople and city was fulfilled the promise of God and man,and there the Ineffable fulfilled all that had been promised,His truth and intention complete in victory; thus was Hethere Ia, the God of the promises fulfilled. And forasmuchas he came to His own house and heritage, as the greattheologian says, and His own did not receive Him but onehere and there, as though in vestiges, He passed on tocommunicate such great benefits to all the nations, who,on receiving Him were made sons of God, new Israelites,nay, out of stones sons of Abraham; for such as adoredstocks and stones made themselves inferior to those very stones.Thus was Jerusalem extended, and its walls, according tothe petition of David in Psalm l. in his penitence, shouldbe built up in order that such a great multitude shouldthe Allelu-ia. When St. Jeromeenter in and singpersuaded Pope Damasus to have this new voice heard inRome, and that it be thus sung in the Hebrew language,these and other greater secrets which we have notattained did he reveal, because for the saintly pontiff toorder so extraordinary a thing (which no doubt must havecaused some alteration), great secrets must he haveIt is seen that even in thenecessarily disclosed to him.time of the Holy Father Gregory I. this affair had not27oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEbeen so well received or established in all parts, throughignorance of the mystery which it enclosed within.Allwere not so careful as Damasus; they did not all heed orcare to comprehend the divine mysteries. We have needalways to lament this negligence; and even at the presentday, at this period when so much light has been thrownover these things, there is smaller pleasure among themany in turning our eyes to study and investigation thanthe bats and owls have in turning their eyes to the raysof the sun.But let us end here this discourse whichwould be lengthened to a great extent if we ventured tomake it equal to the one which follows and similar to theforegone.DISCOURSE THE SECONDSt. Jerome prescribes the Offices of the Church, the formularyof the Prayers, and the Rite of Holy MassTHERE is a doubt when and where St. Jerome performedthese pious labours, of which we are about to treat.Istate this in regard to ordering the Alleluia to be sung inthe Church, and the rest which forms the subjects of thisdiscourse.I think there can be no difficulty in the belief thatthe glorious Pope St. Damasus had died ere his saintlyfriend departed from Rome, as we shall proceed farther onTherefore we must say one of two things,to prove.either that he undertook these works before his arrival inRome when he quitted the wilderness, while stayingalternately in Antioch, or in Bethlehem, or in Jerusalem,or in the solitudes of Palestine, at the earnest petition byletters of Damasus; or that during his sojourn in Rome,as we shall suppose, he occupied himself in these piousexercises during what leisure was left to him after hismany other occupations had been discharged. As regardsthe first theory we have a fact which favours it, in theexistence of a letter written by St. Damasus to St. Jeromewith the doctor's reply attached, in which the pontiffdesires him to undertake these great works and otheraffairs, and Jerome's promise to put into execution what he271272THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwas entrusted with.These letters are to be found amongthe works of our holy doctor in the first volume of theCouncils now more recently collected together, and arealso corroborated by many grave authors as being genuine."Others again there are who will not admit them to begenuine, but strike them out as false and frauds. Thestyle of the letters they maintain is a great argument,since they are far from the style of learned men, anddespite that this argument carries much weight, yet it isnot sufficient to outweigh the authority of so many clevermen and to frustrate the general belief which holds truethe tradition that this was their work. . That this communication, however, passed between Jerome and Damasusby letter is certain, and it has been confirmed in earlier agesby common consent and handed down by unbroken traditionamong lettered men.Whether these letters be true ones or not it is certainthat St. Jerome, with the authority of Damasus, was mostearnest in the adornment and care of the Church, whetherwhen in Syria or when in Rome, or by correspondenceand letters in carrying out what he had promised. Muchin this respect is due to the piety and zeal of the holypontiff, who as one vigilant and zealous for all appertainingto the Church, did not lose any opportunity, and who wasalso one who appreciated the talent of Jerome, perceivingthat in him had descended the spirit of a Bezaleel, andthus employed him to adorn and embellish many thingsnecessary in this tabernacle which God had planted andnot man.Damasus, considering with especial regard allthat appertained to the divine worship, found manydeficienciesThe former holypontiffs, preoccupied as they had been with the persecutions of idolaters, the work of erecting churches, thein plan and harmony.1 Erasmus in 4 vols.Marianus in 9 vols.Perl.

The same was thecase in the recital of the divine office. The Psalms wereindeed recited, but without having a set formulary of lessons,the distribution of prayer and praises for Matins, and therest of the holy hours being left to the individual choice. Noregular form had been established, and the Church, whichin all things is one, in this matter had not had the timenor the peace to establish and agree upon the plan to befollowed, pursuing the doctrine left to the faithful bythe apostles in general, exhorting one another to a holylife, with hymns and psalms, singing in their heartsspiritual canticles which later on were to be utteredby the mouth.In order to establish and arrange themethod and plan of the divine liturgy, Pope Damasusbesought Jerome to set in order the office of the Masses,T274THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEand draw up the formulary of the prayers to be used.For the different masses he was to assign the gospels andthe epistles which were to be said or sung throughout theyear, taking into account the feasts of our redemption, ofthe divine Saviour, and other mysteries of holy faith, thenthe order to be followed on the feasts of the apostles andmartyrs, and lastly the arrangements of the Psalter and theorder of reciting the canonical hours.In the aforesaidletter of Pope Damasus to our doctor he expresses himselfin this wise: “I ask of your charity that, according towhat you learned of your Rector Alexander, our bishop,you will send us the manner of chant used in the GreekChurch when singing the holy Psalms, because, so greatis our simplicity, that it is only when Sunday recurs thatan epistle of the apostles is read, and a chapter from thegospels; and we have neither experience nor the mannerof singing the Psalms, nor is the beauty of the hymnspronounced by our mouth.”The holy doctor did as he was bidden. He arrangedthe whole of the office of the Church; he disposed thePsalms according to the plan which at the present day isin general use in all churches, which on this point do notvary from the Roman. He divided the Psalter among theordinary days of the week. He allotted some of the Psalmsfor the feasts of the apostles, martyrs, and virgins. Heassigned some for lauds, others for vespers, and othersagain for the remaining hours of the day. He furthermore persuaded the holy Pontiff, and obtained his sanction,to add at the end of each psalm that celestial versicle ofconfession and praise of the most holy Trinity, “GloriaPatri et Filio et Spiritut Sancto,” so that the faith of theholy Nicene Council, confessed and declared by the 318Fathers, should resound always in the ears, and by themouths, of the faithful | A favour truly vouchsafed fromTHE OFFICES OF THE CHURCH275Heaven, inspired into the heart of this great doctor andfather of the Church, and worthy of everlasting praise;for, had nothing else remained to us in the Church ofSt. Jerome's labours, we should be under a very greatobligation to him for this work alone. He also apportioned the lessons which were to be said at Matins .throughout the year, gathering from the sacred bookssuch passages as were most appropriate to the varioustimes in such a manner, that the whole of the sacredScriptures should be gone through during the year, andthus knowledge be obtained in the ordinary course ofprayer.Later on he drew up the arrangement in conformity with the above, the gospels and epistles whichwere to be sung at Mass, on the various feasts in thecourse of the sacred cycle, touching upon the mystery ofour redemption, setting their particular narratives; he alsofollowed this plan in regard to feasts of certain saints, suchas the apostles whose history is recorded in the sacredbooks, or such parts as appertained to the spirit anddoctrines of each.All this was carried out with suchmethod and harmony that it was clearly seen that hewas divinely inspired and guided in this heavenly task.The epistles are full of a lofty art: they generallyseem to be commentaries of the gospel selected; all isproportioned and to the point, whereby is seen the greatknowledge that our holy doctor possessed of all the sacredInbooks, and how well he penetrated divine secrets.truth, I venture to say that for this work he had greatassistance from the Holy Spirit, which directed his pen.Respecting the order and arrangement of the divine office,there was composed a book called Comes, or otherwiseknown as Book of Lessons.In proof of what has beenstated, and of its antiquity, I will here state what JacobusPamelius, a very erudite and pious man, says in the276THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEProlegomena or Preambles which he wrote to the aforesaid book, and also what other grave authors declare. Thiswork was printed anew after the reforms had been effectedin the Missal and the Roman Breviary by Pius V. Thusdoes Pamelius speak in the Preface to the second volume:“Among the many other things which, at the desire andpetition of St. Jerome, were ordained in the Church to bedone by Pope Damasus of saintly memory, it is declaredby such as have treated on the scheme of the order ofthe divine offices, was the arrangement of the lessonsand the distribution of the gospels and epistles during thecourse of the year, this being due to St. Jerome. Toprove this they quote frequently in their works the bookcalled Comes, some adding the name of St. Jeromeas the author, while others do so without giving theauthor's name.Putting aside, in the first place, the partsI have quoted in the volume of the Liturgies, and ofAlcuin (who alleges oftentimes these lessons), Amalarius,in his book iii. cap. 40, says that in ancient missals and inthe Book of Lessons there is found written, ‘AebdomadaQuinta ante Natalem Domini, and as many lessons in theBook of Lessons and equal number of gospels from the timereckoned to the Nativity.”Farther on he adds: “Theauthor of the Book of Lessons awakens our faith the moreby representing to us the ages which preceded the comingof our Redeemer, symbolised by the weeks of Advent. Hesubsequently gives another reason for this in the lib. iv.Berno, Bishop of Augsburg, in the book of the Mass,treats upon two questions respecting the divergence existing between the Book of Lessons and the Antiphonary,Theor Book of Antiphons and book of the Sacraments.first question occurs in chapter iv.: “Why does the authorThe two last books mentioned he attributes to St. Gregory Pope, and the first toSt. Jerome.THE OFFICES OF THE CHURCH277of the Offices of the Mass set no more than four weeks(hebdomades) of Advent, whilst he who arranged the Bookof Lessons places five ’’The other question he treatsupon in chapter vi. : ‘Why did the author of the Book ofOffices set twenty-three offices from the octave of Pentecostto Advent, whilst the author of the Book of Lessons setstwenty-five lessons, apart from the lessons and gospelswhich are read during the octave of Pentecost ?’Andwith the Fifth Sunday before the Nativity of our Lord andthat of the Most Holy Trinity, these, together with thetwenty-five, make the number of twenty-seven. In chapterv. this same Bishop Berno treats on the concordance ofthese three books and of their titles, which for brevity'ssake I omit.I will only confine myself to giving thistestimony of his in regard to the authorship.”Similarlyhe says: “As we believe that St. Gregory composed thebook of the Sacraments and of the Antiphons, so also dowe believe that St. Jerome composed the Book of Lessons,as is made manifest by the preface at the beginning ofthe book he calls Comes.”Moreover, Micrologas, inthe book Observationes Ecclesiastica, chapter xxv., statesSt. Jerome to be the author of Comes by the followingwords: “Also in the book Comes or Book of Lessons,which St. Jerome composed, in the fasts of Pentecosthe gives the lessons which appertain to the feasts of theHoly Ghost.” And in chapters xxviii. and xxx. he citesthe lessons contained in the same book, where he alsoattributes the authorship of them to St. Jerome. The samedoes John Beleth, the theologian, allege in the Rationaleof the Divine Offices, chapter lvii., where he says that St.Jerome, at the pleading of Pope Damasus, ordained thatin all the churches should be read and followed whathad been drawn up and arranged by St. Jerome for theseasons, drawn from the New and the Old Testament.278THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMELastly, for the confirmation of this statement, it becomesvery important to note that the ancient Fathers made aremembrance of the lessons that are read from both theTestaments, publicly and in common, and that the successors of St. Damasus “make particular mention of theapostolic and evangelical lessons, as appears from what wesaw in the first volume, as, for instance, such saints asSt. Ambrose of Milan, St. Augustine of Africa, St. Leothe Great (Pope), St. Silvanius and St. Cesarius of France,while the three last use the translation of St. Jerome.”All this is from Pamelius, in the above-quoted place of thesecond volume, where he purposely authorises the bookcalled Comes or Book of Lessons, which begins from thevigil of the Nativity with the lessons of Isaias Prophet:“Aac dicit Dominus, propter Sion non tacebo,” etc. Andthe Epistle of St. Paul, “Ad Romanos, Paulus servus JesuChristi vocatus Apostolus.” And the Gospel “SecundumMatthaeum,” “Cum esset desponsata Mater Jesu MariaJoseph.” And following all the feasts of the Lord, andthe Sundays of the year, marking the stations of thechurches of Rome, setting the feasts of the apostles andmartyrs, comes Advent, beginning with the Fifth Sunday,reckoning up to the vigil of the Nativity, assigning gospels,epistles, and lessons for the fourth and sixth days of theweek. On completing the course of the year he addsalso theRites for the Dedication of Churches, theCeremonial for the Ordination of Deacons, Priests, andBishops, and finally he gives the Office for the Dead,thus ending the Book of Lessons.From this is seenthat the Missal and Breviary, which now, so divinelyordained, are in use, differ but little from venerable antiquitydue to the arrangement of St. Jerome; a matter of greatjoy to the pious, who see how united the Church hasalways been, since even in this matter, where, the fieldTHE OFFICES OF THE CHURCH279and liberty were so wide that she might have effectedvariety and change, she yet has not done so.Hence howmuch in the wrong are those, who understand so little,yet tell us that these things are of recent date; thosewho speak thus have not looked into the books of authorsso ancient, grave, and learned and erudite, who received itas a thing established and worthy of the highest reverence.In the first volume the same Pamelius, treating on whatthe holy Pontiff St. Damasus had ordained in the Church,says as follows: “In the pontifical books, in the Life ofSt. Damasus, it is stated that he ordered the Psalms to besung night and day throughout the Church. He orderedthis to the bishops, the priests, and to the monasteries innearly similar terms.” Wilfridus Strabo says the same thingin his book On the Offices of the Church, in chapter xxv.Marianus Scotus, in the second volume of his History,expresses himself in these words: “Damasus, the twentyeighth pope after St. Peter, ordained that in the wholeChurch there should be sung day and night the Psalms.”This is confirmed by Venerable Bede, Haddo, and UsuardusSigisbert in his Chroniclesin their “Martyrologies.”affirms the same thing.All these authors allude to thewords of that epistle which was quoted of our saint, whichstands in the first volume of the Councils of the Church. Thisis confirmed, too, by Albinus Flaccus in his work De OfficiisDivinis, where he says that the verse “Gloria Patri etPilio,” etc., which words St. Jerome composed at the petitionof Damasus, divides the Psalms from one another, becauseformerly they were sung consecutively without division.That, not satisfied with this verse, considering it toosmall a pause between psalm and psalm, the same sovereignPontiff again asked him to separate it further, whereupon St. Jerome added the other verse, “Sicut eral inSigisbert, Cron. anno 382.28oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROME£rincipio et nunc et semper, et in sacula sæculorum. Amen.”Rudolphus Turgensis says that the verse “Gloria Patri,”etc., was composed by the Nicene Council, and that PopeDamasus ordered it to be sung at the end of each psalm.The same was said by Martinus Polonus in the year 370.Respecting the epistles and the gospels, Wilfridus Strabo,in the book already referred to, says thus: “It appearsthat in those times there were neither appointed nor readother lessons before the gospel but those from St. Paul; thesewere named only by the one who wrote the Deeds of thePontiffs when he made a commemoration of the Antiphons,of which formerly they had none, and there was only readan epistle of the apostle, and the gospel, which statement ismade by the pontiff Damasus, when writing to Jerome, insimilar words.”Subsequently, after a careful examination of all pointsrelating to this arrangement, there were set by Jeromeother new lessons, not only taken from the New Testament, but even from the Old, according as the variousRudolphus, in the aforesaid quotation,feasts demanded.says thatSt. Jerome, cardinal priest, arranged andcomposed the order to be followed of the epistles and ofthe gospels, and this order is still adhered to at the presentday in the Church, as is proved by the book called Comes.And writing to the Bishop Constantius, he says that PopeDamasus determined they should be thus read, as inIn order to manifest the antiquity anduse to this day.the genuineness of the book called Comes, which he wasbringing forth to the light, and how ancient the originalswere, he states in the Preface to the first volume as follows:“Of the Comes, or according to the moderns as it is nowcalled, Book of the Lessons of the most blessed Saint Jerome,I declare that it was transcribed from the original whichlies in the library and sacristy of our Cathedral ChurchTHE OFFICES OF THE CHURCH281of Bruges, and subsequently both Hitorpus and myselfcompared it with some ancient originals of Cologne, amongwhich there was one in the Metropolitan Church of SaintPeter, over eight hundred years old, as was proved by theCatalogue of the same library.”Further on Pamelius quotes other very ancient originals of some 600 years, by which is fully investigatedthe truth of the volume.The theologian John Beleth,in the aforesaid place quoted, says: “The offices of theChurch were arranged by the blessed Saint Jerome, at therequest of Pope Damasus, and all that is read of the Oldand New Testament in the Church.St. Gregory was anauthor, and he composed some of the chants, and Gelasiussome hymns and other things, because in the time ofTheodosius the Greater, the Psalms being said withoutany appointed order, he besought Pope Damasus to makeit his care to have the office of the Church arranged,which thing Damasus effected by means of the BlessedSaint Jerome.”And in chapter xix. he further says: “We have saidin the first place, speaking in a general way, that no onething must be sung or read which be not approved by thesupreme Pontiff.In the primitive Church each one sungwhat he pleased, so long as what was sung appertainedto the divine praises.Some things were common andfollowed by all, either because taught by Christ, suchas the Lord's Prayer, or by the apostles, as the Creed.Subsequently, when heresies and schisms sprang up in theChurch and attacked her, the Emperor Theodosius, considering all things—for he himself had endeavoured tosuppress and bring to naught the heresies of his time—conferred with Damasus the Pontiff, and besought himto summon some pious learned man to arrange and fixIn rational. div.

When Pope Damasus examinedthe labours of St. Jerome, he commanded this arrangement to be kept and used in the Church.”All this iswhat John Beleth says.I shall conclude this subject, which appears well proved,with the authority of Honorius of Augsburg in his bookof Gemma Anima, and on the Concordance of the divineoffices, where he says: “As anciently the divine office wassaid in the Church according as each one liked; but subsequently, when the crowd of heretics began to divide intoa thousand sections the unity of the Church of JesusChrist, and schismatics broke it up in their conventiclesand assemblies, the Emperor Theodosius of gloriousmemory, earnestly and diligently strove that a Councilshould be convened in Constantinople, wherein all theheresies of that time were condemned, and he humblyasked the Synod to give orders as to the divine officesaffairbeingDamasus, the Roman Pontiff, entrusted to Jerome, apriest, a most learned man in divine and human letters.The erudite doctor did this work when living in the smallcity of Bethlehem, where our Saviour was born. Hefixed andimportantarranged.ThisTHE OFFICES OF THE CHURCH283distributed the Psalms among the hours of the night andof the day with great prudence in the form which theChurch sings them even to the present day.For theoffice of the Mass he assigned lessons and gospels, takingthem from the Old and New Testament, according as hedeemed convenient to the time and to the seasons, becausethe Roman Church, when she seeks the succour of thesaints, forms processions and makes stations to the differentchurches. When Damasus received the plan of the divineoffices so wisely composed by St. Jerome, he summonedthe College, and ordained that it should be thus sung andrecited throughout the Church. Subsequently, St. Gregoryand Gelasius made the prayers and chants which wereappropriate to the lessons and the gospels according tothe aforesaid plan, and now practised by the Church duringthe celebration of the divine offices.As regards the statement made by the two authors,John Beleth and Honorius, that St. Jerome composedthis plan when in Bethlehem, and even when St. Paulawas already dwelling there, it is clearly a mistake, becausewithout doubt St. Damasus was already dead when Jeromeand Paula lived in Bethlehem, as we shall show farther onvery clearly from the very epistles of the saint himself.It might have been the case that, as I have already said,all this affair was carried through before he came to Rome,when dwelling in Bethlehem.I consider it far moreprobable that he did not do so, but that it was effectedwhen in Rome, despite that upon this question theseletters were written; and I have a suspicion that the reasonfor being compelled to go to Rome by Imperial letterswas the occasion of this affair.It has been fully shown that our great doctor servedthe Church in all these things, and that through his diligence and holy labours the divine office is resplendent284THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwith the beauty which we perceive at the present day.He introduced the song of Alleluia / the versicle GloriaPatri et Filio; the distinction of the ordinary week daysby psalms; the epistles, the lessons, and the chant: allthings of themselves so inspired by Heaven, that such asdo not enjoy them here below will not enjoy them above:things which clearly manifest the great favours which thesoul of the saint received from God, and moreover thingswhich, without being in the company of angels, could nothave been so well arranged.And thus does John Cassian express himself in thesecond book of Institution of Monks and Monasteries, thatthis scheme of the work done by St. Jerome in arrangingthe divine offices was not a thing of human genius, butthat it was communicated to him by means of the angelssent from heaven. And in truth this doctor speaks justly,forasmuch as there is something of majesty and glory,which lifts up the spirit of men so above themselves,renders them quite other men, that being filled with asupernatural spirit, they are raised above all human intercourse, and appear to be in another region, taken up fromearth during the time they are celebrating the divineoffices; and the angels do not disdain to mix themselvesin this intercourse with men, and they come down withloving affection to the company of mortals.Oftentimeshave the voices of these servants of God been heardmingling with ours, when, in the silent hours of thenight, with joyful vigils and songs, at times glad, at otherssad, they have awakened the Lord and Spouse of religioussouls; and He, moved by such welcome sounds, communesand communicates Himself to these by gifts, and takesdelight in those pure verses and canticles on earth betterthan in the dwellings of the heavens. Oh! thou Jerominite Order! with good reason dost thou take pride inTHE OFFICES OF THE CHURCH285the divine office and love thy choirs |Thine do I call it,since it had its birth, so to say, in the house of thy Father,and it comes to thee, as to a daughter by inheritance, andin whatsoever day thou shouldst not follow this with thecare which has been thine up to the present—do not everagain call thyself his daughter!Let the world style theeas it may, for we well know how deceived it ever is inassigning names to things.Let others spend the nightsand the days in what may so please them; but thou, as isthy custom, holy mother, spend it in the divine praises:let them be found thus by the night, when the sun setsbelow the horizon and when it illumines those that arebeneath our feet; and there also let it find thee when itcomes forth in the morning ! Thy inheritance is thechoir and the song, the purity and cleanliness of thehouse of the Lord, the spotlessness and the adornment ofHis palaces on this earth ! The same office will be thineto perform high up in the heavens, where no other occupation is known but that of singing the divine praises !And in truth the choir is an angelic institution: it wasnot learned, as some appear to think, from the vain pagans,who, placed in choirs and circles, as we now declare it,in a ring, sang and danced before the brutal and uncleanaltars of their abominable gods, holding each other's handsor singly, beseeching in their songs that their sacrifices beaccepted which were offered to them. A more ancientand nobler foundation has the Church in her holy rites,and one that she learned from better masters.Theprophet Isaias beheld the seraphs placed in choirs, howthey sang with alternate voices: Holy I holy! to the Lordof armies, and celestial choirs.”Coor, in the languageof the Scythians and Cimmerians, means multitude, who1 Scaligerus, de Arte Poet, lib. 1, cap. 49.Gorop, Hermit, lib. 77.286THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEplaced in a circle with pious ceremonies and chants, aresinging in coor, which among them is interpreted as thoughwe should say, fountain and circle of eternity; and thisappertains to the angels before any other creatures. Fromthis word, it is said, arose the Greek and Latin term chorus;while reversed, or the letters taken backwards, wouldform rooc, which in the same tongue means smoke; and achoir of such as praise God is in truth a smoke and mostsweet perfume which touches the nostrils of God, andappeases Him, restrains His wrath, and mitigates it. TheBook of Ecclesiasticus says: “The oblation of the justennobles the altar and is a sweet odour in the worship ofthe Most High.”From this is seen the reason for the holy ceremonyused in the Church, that those who are in the choir singingand praising the Eternal Majesty of God in a circle, without beginning or end, are incensed with perfumes, in orderto give them to understand that their songs and hymnsare perfumes which touch the nostrils of God, and are toHim sweet smelling, as were the sacrifices which Noeoffered Him after leaving the ark, and the sacred Scripturessay God smelled them, and they rose up an odour ofsweetness, which is a most lofty mystery to be treated onmore leisurely. That smoke which comes forth from thecenser is a symbol of the devotion and the spirit whichburns within, and the smoke ascends to God; from whenceit is concluded that the outward smoke would be idle,fruitless, unless it had the signification which correspondsto the interior.Because the spirit which rises to God inpraises is a joyous choir, a spiritual smoke to the divinenostrils and ears. These two things must be close together: from the interior spirit burning and exhaling asweet perfume which ascends towards God, must also risethe melody and song of the choir, because otherwise theirTHE OFFICES OF THE CHURCH287voices will be dispersed and cast to the winds.It wasthis that our saintly doctor essayed to plant in the Church,imitating the angels in choirs, so that our spirits, glowingwith divine love, should rise in union with the voices untilmaking music before God He is enveloped by a most sweetperfume.This Jerome did not learn from Isaias, but inthose delightful moments when, raised above the earth, hehimself has declared to us on oath that he found himselfamid the choirs of angels, as we have already seen andInremarked when writing his life in the wilderness.regard to the division of the lessons, I believe he adaptedit from the practice in the Hebrew synagogue, because, asis proved in chapter xiii. of Apostolic Deeds or Practice of theGospel, the Hebrews had apportioned the Books of theProphets throughout all the weeks of the year, these saidlessons containing all the more remarkable propheciesrespecting the Messiah, Christ our Lord, in order that theJews should not suffer ignorance and that they shouldunderstand. Thus speaks St. Paul when addressing theJews in the synagogue of Antioch, that the Jews whodwelt in Jerusalem, and the princes among them, ignoredthe Messias’ formally and maliciously, as well as the voicesof the prophets, which are read out and proclaimed duringthe course of the week.In imitation of this plan, ourdoctor divided the whole of the sacred Scriptures whichmanifest Christ to us, through the entire course of theThe scheme of the epistles andweeks of the year.gospels he took from apostolic tradition; and whereashe was so well informed in the antiquity and history of theChurch, he was well qualified to arrange them with methodand order.After the descent of the Holy Ghost on the apostles,those heavenly men who had received the first-fruits of1 Acts xiii.288THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthis treasure, in their deep gratefulness would meet together to celebrate the mysteries of the redemption of theworld in the communication and breaking of the Bread,for with these words does St. Luke signify the Sacramentof the Eucharist. At the beginning the number was smalland they were all together, they knew one another, all wereperfect men, saintly, full of God. The Church grew, somefew separated and went to dwell in various towns, some inJerusalem, others in Antioch, others again in Rome,Corinth, and Ephesus; some of these were of the highestholiness; others were still imperfect, for under thesetwo heads does the apostle divide them. No longer couldthey be gathered together in one church, because povertyand the persecution of the Gentiles did not allow of largegatherings nor public ones.Secretly would they dividethemselves as best they could, where there were manyunder divers names and titles—some were called of theband or brotherhood of John, others of Bartholomew, andso on. On meeting together in this way, either each dayor when they could, the first thing they did was to confessthemselves as unworthy of so much good, and to accusethemselves humbly and in common of their defects; thenthey rose up and sang some hymns as best they thought.After this, if any letter had been received by that congregation or brotherhood, from the apostle St. Paul, orfrom any of their princes, it was read carefully in public,and each received what duties were ordered, what doctrineor mystery explained, the counsels, the reprehensions conveyed in that epistle.After the reading of this letter,which was done slowly, all being seated, and listened towith deep attention, a portion of the gospel was read,either such portion as had been declared in the letter orThis ended, they all made athat came to the purpose.profession of the faith, either by the creed which theTHE OFFICES OF THE CHURCH289apostle had composed, or in the order which was mostconvenient. And whilst the offering of bread and winewas being prepared which was to be consecrated, themembers of that meeting contributed their alms for thenecessitous brothers and the poor generally, whether present or absent.After this they joined in prayer to Godfor the whole world, for the princes of the Church, menapostles, or apostolic; then for the heads of the Republics,whether Christian or idolaters, so that He should be pleasedto enlighten them, and guide in good ways the affairs oftheir Republic and government: this formed the preface.Then were celebrated the holy mysteries of the redemptionof the world, consecrating the bread and the wine into thebody and blood of our God and Lord Jesus Christ, as Hehad left it ordained it should be done in His memory and asHe had willed.Before communicating they said the Lord'sPrayer, calling God Father, and asking for all the benefitswhich from His hand can come to us, and, in particular,that He should give them that divine Bread, figured inother times by the manna, so that they should feel withinthem the promised Sabbath.They then received theHoly Communion, and those divine souls beheld theheavenly treasures and the Sacrament—hidden throughout the ages—manifested to them. They beheld God inthemselves, and themselves within Him, and they communicated themselves to Him and He to them. Theysaw themselves all made one in that mystic Body, inspirit and in truth. They were absorbed, full of God, asthough inebriated with the divine sweetness, and that newwine, that is not poured into old leathern bottles, whichsavour of the first bad manufacture.Such was the Mass in that golden age, these were thedivine offices celebrated: all this is gathered from thenarrative of the Acts and apostolic practices, and fromU290THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe Epistles of St. Paul, if with attention they be read andmeditated upon. Some remains of this still exist, thoughin a very much lower grade, in the brotherhoods orconfraternities that are scattered throughout the world,known under the name of St. John, of St. Peter, andof Our Lady, and other saints, the members meetingtogether in the churches under these invocations for Mass,sermons, and other spiritual works. Would that theydid not meet at meals, so that they should not becomeThis evil, and abuse, commenced veryso inflamed !early indeed. We have nothing to wonder at that suchthings should occur in these our times, when even in thetime of the apostles, the text of the Epistle to the Corinthians, it was said in truth, “Alius guidem esurit, aliusautem ebrius est.”“Perchance,” he adds then, “have younot houses where you can eat and drink? or do youdespise the Church of God?” They had not well comprehended the doctrine which the holy apostle had givenconcerning the Supper of the Lord, and they fell into thisabuse; for had it been performed with that order whichwe have described, it would be all full of charity, and forthat reason does he repeat in chapter xi. of the Epistle,and declares to them this most sacred mystery, in orderthat they should know what it means to meet together inthe church and to communicate in one Spirit. He hadalso in chapter iii. of the same Epistle touched somewhat on this” when he accuses them of being men whowere yet carnal; and he gives the reason, saying thatthere existed among them a rivalry and a question as towhich (so to say) was of a higher confraternity and hadbeen baptized by the better hand. Some would say: Weare better, for we are of Paul; others: Because we whoNo,are of Cephas, who is the head, have the advantage.I Cor. xi.I Cor. iii.THE OFFICES OF THE CHURCH291indeed; but we who are of Apollo.All this was nothingmore than the work of the enemy, who was sowing earlyIn these gatherings and meetings, and otherharvests.similar ones, began to be celebrated the divine officessimply and purely; and those masters, great as they were,began to teach and to enjoin the order of what in thoseAnd the apostle in chapter xv.,times was permitted.after having instructed them in the essential, concluded bysaying, “What is wanting, when I come to see you I willdispose, and order how it shall be done.”Of all these things the report had come down fromhand to hand together with the tradition, and many thingswere proved in the writings of the learned men of thosetimes who succeeded the apostles, particularly in theoriental churches.Our doctor took advantage of all this,hence he set in order all things for the use of the Church,and with such wisdom and doctrine that this order andplan was preserved and followed during the course of theages down to the present and for all time.DISCOURSE THE THIRDSt. Jerome translates the Holy Scriptures at the Petition ofSt. Damasus, with especial reference to the Psalms.The Translation of the Septuagint is here considered.WHEN the matter of the arrangement of the divine officewas brought to a conclusion with such great care and skill,the holy Pontiff was filled with jubilation; and he forthwithordained that this new arrangement should be used throughout the Church. In the Roman Church it was at once adoptedin order to invest the same with authority.In that happy ageall things appertaining to the external worship and ceremonialin the Latin Church began to assume force and lustre, theGreek Church having hitherto excelled the Latin in thesematters, and the prelates so cleverly managed in a shorttime to work this out, that from this point the Latin Churchhad no need to be envious of any other.Inspired by Godor charmed at the result, as well as urged by the existingnecessity, the same pontiff besought the holy doctor tocomplete this sacred adorning and perfect the unity of thedivine worship in the whole Church by undertaking thelabour of amending the Psalter of David, since it was theThis was sung, as it hadpart most in use by the faithful.ever been sung, according to the translation of theSeptuagint.There existed great discordance in theecclesiastical music, which greatly offended the ear because292TRANSLATION OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES293some would recite it one way, others followed anotherplan, all due to the small care taken hitherto to adhere tothat holy translation in its primitive entirety. This pointis a very grave one—indeed, one of the gravest in thishistory; and inorder that the case be understoodonce and for all, I will exert myself to treat upon it in abrief manner, commencing from its foundation, for it isnot easy to shed any light upon a thing which is soobscure.The sacred Scriptures—I mean what appertains to theOld Testament—were written by the act of the HolyGhost, the ministers being many.The first and theprincipal was Moses, and after him the rest of the holyIt was written in the language of Canaan,prophets.which language was subsequently called Hebrew, from theHebrews or travellers (for thus does the word “Hebrews”signify), as will be stated in another part. The Scripturesfor many years were confined to this language, withoutpassing into another until the sons of Israel were freedfrom their captivity on their return to their own land ofCanaan.Then the ancients and learned men amongthem perceived that the people and the classes generally,by reason of the long captivity lasting seventy years, hadforgotten much of the mother tongue, and had acquiredthe Chaldaic, as one who had been unable to sing thecanticle of the Lord in a strange land, and they agreed,their language, wellas pious men and learned ingrounded in the truth, to impart and instruct their sonsand the rest of the people in the law and the sacred books.Yet they had further saintly considerations. The first, toenable all to participate in that great treasure of the Word ofGod, and with their own eyes see the light and not allegeignorance.Secondly, to assure the perpetuity of thatsaid law by extending it to other tongues, so that others294THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEThirdly, remove theshould read it and learn much.occasion of saying that they alone were raised up by theirlearning, and did not wish, in order to preserve theirFor allauthority, that others should know what they did.these reasons they conferred upon and agreed to translatethe law into the Chaldaic and the Syriac, both commonlanguages which were in daily use and spoken by all.The heroes of this undertaking, if we may believe Eliasthe Levite in his “Al Meoreth,” were three. Orchelos, whotranslated the law comprised in the five books of Moses.Jonathas, to whom fell the prophets, first and last, Joshua,Judges, and Kings, the four greater prophets and the twelveminor ones.Josephus, to this one were given the translation of the Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Canticles, and the rest ofthe sacred books, which the Hebrews call Cherubim andthe Greeks Hagiographa.This was the first translation ofthe holy Scriptures, and of such great authority among theJews that, when they have any doubt, they resort to thisedition to solve the said doubts, and remain so well satisfied with the question so lucidly explained as though GodAnd their convictionHimself had revealed it to them.is good and in reason, because, together with their deepknowledge, they were learned in the law, and they themselves were held to be saints.This translation is more ofa paraphrase and a free rendering than a translation.It wasso done for the aforesaid reasons. They called it Targum,Those expounders lived inwhich is equal to Exposition.times previous to the coming of Christ, and for that reasonless suspected.If in our days it were to be found as theyhad left it, without doubt it would be a great treasure tous. What at present has been brought out and stands asthe body of the royal Bible, although it is the best andmost polished (omitting a few foolish things which somemalicious Talmudists had inserted), nevertheless, manyTRANSIATION OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES295passages are untrustworthy; yet it is of great service, andas a paraphrase and exposition very good, without goingfurther as regards authority, nor its having greater forcethan any other exposition might have of any ancientauthor.There is no certitude that the Syriac translation, which is in a language formed for the greaterpart of a mixture of the Chaldean and the Hebrew, despitethat the characters and grammar differ considerably, wasdone by these same authors, for it is a question whichhas not been properly investigated up to the presentday.ourdoctorEpiphanius,In what regards the New Testament, some affirm that itwas translated by St. Mark the Evangelist—a thing which,however, appears difficult to believe unless with a declaredauthority.In this doubt I am strengthened by the factthat neither St. Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius,St.Athanasius, Theophilus,Jerome, nor Theodoretus, nor indeed any others of theancient Fathers, who have diligently treated on the affairconcerning the translations, have made any mention ofthis, some of these having lived in Egypt and others inSyria, from which fact the suspicion has arisen in me thatthis translation is of a more recent date and subsequent tothe times when the above-quoted authors existed. Nevertheless, it is my belief that the Gospel of St. Matthewand the Epistle of the apostle St. Paul to the Hebrewswere both originally written in the language of Syria.This is proved with sufficient plausibility by some modernauthors, and although many of the aforesaid Fathers' maysay that both these portions were written in the Hebrew,there is no contradiction, because they speak of thecommon Hebrew of those times which actually was theThis is proved by the testimonies of theSyriac tongue.1 Albertus Wid. in act.

JEROMEgospel, because where it says Hebraice Autem Golgotha,and other expressions of the same kind which St. Jeromenoticed in the book of the Hebrew names, they areSyriac words and not native Hebrew ones. These werethe first translations of the sacred Scriptures.As to the Greek translations—in order to approachnearer our purpose—St. Clement of Alexandria, in thefirst of his “Stromas,” says that previous to the time ofthe great Alexander there had been a translation made inGreek of the sacred books, but it is not known who wasthe author.It appears that this translation was knownto Plato, Aristotle, and other philosophers, who made useof itsWould that theytheir writings.had derived greater advantage, and not bartered theirdreams so dearly |And whereas there followed thefamous translation of the Septuagint, this first one mustnecessarily have been of small authority as having beendone by some private individual, was then gradually forgotten, and the edition so exhausted that not even a relicremains of it.doctrineinFrom this results that authors assign the first place tothe seventy interpreters (it is of small importance to ourpurpose to dispute whether there were seventy-two).St.Irenaeus' and St. Clement of Alexandria say that it wasdone at the petition of Ptolemy, son of Cagi, who sent toEleazar, the high priest, to assign learned men to do thetranslation, because he had in his own library a copy of thesacred Scriptures.Aristaeus in a history he wrote on thissubject; and Josephus” in the 12th of his Antiquities; Philoin the second book of the Life of Moses; Tertullian” in theApologetic; St. Athanasius in his Synopsis; St. Epiphaniusin the work on Weights and Measures; and many othersJoseph, Aut, lib. 12, c. 2.Tertul.

Some grave authors among the Latins haveventured to say, that the Seventy translated no fartherthan the five books of Moses. They make our holy doctorchief author of this statement, because in the book on theHebraic Questions, and in the chapter v. of Ezechiel, andin ii. of Micheas, it appears he approves this, and confirms it with the authority of Aristaeus in the book of thishistory, and with that of Josephus’ in the quoted place;and Philo, in the place above-said, notes the same, whilesome moderns say that it is a common sentence of theThis becomes a probability from the fact thatHebrews.the whole translation did not occupy more than seventydays, according as it is affirmed by Aristaeus, and Josephus,and by St. Isidore” in his offices. Of this opinion is theauthor of the book Sederholam-minor," and others. Thecontrary, however, is the opinion of the ancient fathersand doctors, from Justin Martyr in the Dialogue againstTryphon; St. Irenaeus, lib. 11, cap. xxxv.; St. Clement ofAlexandria; Epiphanius and Eusebius in the places quotedEuseb. 8 De Prapar.

Our holy doctor is also of this opinion;because, although in the passage quoted, which was onMicheas, he doubts that this translation should be theSeptuagint, and quotes Josephus and other Hebrews,and in the preface of the Hebrew questions he saysthe same; yet he there speaks, if we read it attentively, of the opinion of others, and not his own, withoutaffirmation, because in all his commentaries on the twelveProphets (according as he declares against Rufinus) heHis words are these :uses it together with his own.“Despite that learned men like Josephus and the Hebrewsmay say, that the seventy interpreters only translated thefive books of Moses, yet I, following the authority of theancients—Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Origen—say that theyAnd Itranslated the whole of the Old Testament.”think, that when Aristaeus says that the Seventy translatedMartinez,Hypotypos, lib.Senen, ult. capit. totius Biblioth.c.1., et haeretici judaizantes.1,Euseb.

There is another verymuch disputed question, viz., whether these seventy-twointerpreters were all gathered together, or apart each inhis own chamber alone, or all in one chamber, or in twosand twos.In any way, it appears a great marvel. Andit was wonderful indeed that so many men in so short aspace of time as seventy-two days should come togetherand agree on such a long and difficult work, and that nogreat differences of opinion should have occurred, a factso unusual in this kind of work and among men of deeplearning, for the greater be the learning the greater theIn truth I hold it adifficulty to maintain an opinion.greater miracle than, if apart, and each in his cell, theyshould have agreed to it.This question of the separatecells carries the authority and foundation of Justin Martyr'in the Exhortation to the Gentiles, where it says that hesaw remains and vestiges of the little cells in Alexandriawhere the translation was made.Following Justin, andtrusting to his authority, come St. Irenaeus, St. Cyril, St.Clement of Alexandria, St. Augustine,” in his De CivitateJustin.

Somemoderns add Philo" in the lib. 2 of the Life of Moses,Tertullian * in his Apologetics, and St. John Chrysostomin the fifth homily on St. Matthew, yet these threeauthors do not say a word respecting the dwellings andcells, but only that all these authors agreed marvellouslynot only in the sense, but in the words.St. Epiphanius,in the work on Weights and Measures, says that they wereenclosed two and two, and that by a miracle each onecame forth with his translation complete of the wholesacred Scriptures, with the same words, in such sort thatthere remained clearly thirty-six translations.The reason for this action of carefully separating themin divers dwellings, St. Irenaeus tells us (and from whichsubsequently Eusebius drew his information)" was becausePtolemy wished to prove the truth of the translation,fearing lest the Jews should attempt some unfair act byconcealing the secrets; but that subsequently when theinterpretation was read before him, finding that the wholework was so conformable, God was glorified, making itmanifest that thewriting was divine, because frombeginning to the end all their translations were expressedJustinin the selfsame sentences and words throughout.adds that this was known from the ancient histories tohave been the fact, and that the king had employed greatcare that there should be no communication between oneanother during the time that the translation was beingmade; for which purpose he placed guards and overseers,besides keeping them apart.All this is contradicted by our holy doctor, who callsthis narrative a tale and a legend of old women, in the1 Philon. 2 De Vita Moisis.Tertullian, in Apologet. cap. 19.Euseb, lib. 5, Histor.

Without doubthad Tertullian, Philo, and Chrysostom any trustworthynotice of them, they would not have remained silent,because they purposely treated on the subject.Moreover,despite that these said authors state that it was a greatmarvel in the interpreters to agree so perfectly in thetranslation on every point, nevertheless they make nomention of any such cells, for, as it has been well said,it was no less marvellous to arrange in so short a time thetranslation uniformly; hence it appears to St. Augustine,in the place quoted in his Christian doctrine, that, according to both opinions, this concord and uniformity was anThis sentence of our doctor seems theadmirable fact.safest and most reliable, and satisfies some of the modernssuch as Titelman and others, for though some with smallfoundation reply that the work of Aristaeus which we nowTitelman, in Prolog.

JEROMEhave is a spurious one of the Rabbis, and not the true one,it matters little to the purpose, since we see and read in thisone—such as it is—the same as is referred by Josephus,Tertullian, Eusebius, and our Jerome without a singledeviation. And as regards what one of these modernssays, who takes this very much to heart, so much so thathe loses his head, that St. Epiphanius read Aristaeus andcites him, and remarks upon the little cells—a thing hewould not have done if he had seen them reprobated inAristaeus—is undoubtedly an argument about as strong asthe genius of this author, who exercises himself butlittle in the rules of Dialectics, and knew few of those ofscholastic theology, which intruth was necessary, inHenceorder, as he used to say, to challenge St. Jerome.I say that if with this testimony of Epiphanius he stillwishes to tell us that in his time Aristaeus was uncorruptedand without falsehoods, and that subsequently these wereadded, or assumed, it is a thing without any truth, becauseJosephus and Eusebius were more ancient than Epiphanius,and they found no such cells in Aristaeus. And if he furtherwishes to say that previous to Epiphanius the true Aristaeushad not been found, and that they had come upon himthere, I ask of the first how does he know this, and whydoes he qualify from hence the works of Aristaeus, andmake out some to be true and others false. Secondly, doeshe not perceive that St. Jerome dwelt for a long timewith Epiphanius, with whom he often conferred, and theywere very much attached to each other, Jerome beingsomewhat younger, and he says he read naught of this inAristaeus, rather he reprobates that about the cells, andtherefore it brings nothing to this testimony; and itappears evident St. Epiphanius followed the reputation and1 Ludovicus Vives, cap. 42, lib. 18, De Civitate; Leo Castro, Praefat, in Comment.Isai, cap. 35.TRANSLATION OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES303word of Justin and Irenaeus, and differs from them in notassigning more than thirty-six cells, since all the rest setdown seventy-two or none at all.From all this follows another questionas to theauthority and force of thistranslation, because somemoderns wish to prove so much with all their geniusThe chief reason is notthat they were even prophets.a very good one, nor even safe, because the fountainwhence it is taken is a small authority on this questionof prophecy—it was Plato. He says in his Timaeus that hewas more worthy of the name of prophet, who coulddeclare the prophecies, than the one who uttered theprophecy.He understood this as it sounds, and inisparticular to the purpose under discussion, since itmost false to say that if a prophecy is written in Hebrewor in Greek, and I should turn it into the vernacular orinto Latin, that I am more of a prophet than he whoprophesied it;is toprophesy in its proper sense, as must be taken in regardto the sacred books, we should have otherwise to callprophets an infinite number of translators and interpreters.He assumes to prove this by a great crowd of authoritiesof saints, very proper in regard. to other purposes, as anyone can see who has judgment; but, in effect, no one isfound to have said they were prophets but this authorwho dreams it.St. Jerome, speaking (as he well knewit would be said) on this case, says they were notprophets but interpreters, as we observed in the placeabove quoted of the Preface on the Pentateuch, and thesame thing does he declare on the Hebraic Questions, andin the little book De Optimo genere Interpretandi, and inthe Epistle to Sunia and Fratela.for holding to its force what itDespite the case to be so in regard to the power orLeon Castro, 4 lib.

JEROMEthe“Had thefirst words:property of prophecy, there is no doubt they were notprophets, yet it cannot be denied they were divinelyexcellent interpreters, and had received a very particulargift of the Holy Ghost for translating; and from what wehave said above it is proved, for they did not err in whatthey translated, but they in such a manner wrote downin the Greek language what God had said in the Hebrew,that they appeared to be rather prophets than interpreters,although in truth they were interpreters and not prophets.This verdict has been well received by the ancient writers,Aristaeus, Philo, Josephus, as well as by the Fathers of theChurch, Justin, Irenaeus, Eusebius, Clement of Alexandria,and the rest we have quoted from, and among them, as onewho most approves of this view, is our saintly doctor, who,in the Preface on the Paralipomenon, says this almostinof theSeptuagint continued in the purity and integrity withwhich it had been rendered into Greek, it would be asuperfluous act, O Chromatius!—among bishops most holyand learned l—to induce me and constrain me to translatethe Hebrew books into Latin; because what had been oncesealed in their ears, and what had been created and confirmed by the faith of the Church in its principles, would bejust what we should by our silence approve.

As regards the provinces,which lie between these, their people all read the volumes oftranslationTRANSLATION OF THE SEPTUAGINT305Palestine which were published by Eusebius and Pamphiliusfrom the works of Origen. The whole wonder is in thesethree diverse parts contending.”In the second Preface on this same book he alsospeaks to the same purpose in these words: “I tell youthe truth freely and simply (he is addressing Damianus andRogatianus), that in such a way is this book of namesvitiated and untruthful in the Greek and Latin volumes,that it does not appear so much a Hebrew book as anYetaggregation of barbarous names from Sarmatia.this must not be attributed to the seventy interpreters,for, full of the Holy Ghost, they translated faithfully, but tothe act of the writers who, from the fair and amended copy,Oftentimes does it occur that out oftranscribed falsely.three names they form one, removing from the centre someletters; at other times, on the contrary, out of one whichappears overlong they form two or three.”From both these places it is seen that St. Jerome doesnot reprehend the translation of the Septuagint as theirown, but as blotted out and amended by the fault of thecopyists, and neither Jerome nor any other saint deniesWhat theythat the Spirit of God enlightened them.do deny, then, is what prophecy properly is.It wasundoubtedly a miracle and a clear proof of the assistanceof God that so great a work should have been concludedso expeditiously, with so much faithfulness and concord.Hence does Philo say in the book of the Life of Mosesthat every year a feast is held in the place where thetranslation was done in order to celebrate the memory ofThis is the authority which may beso great a marvel.given to the Septuagint, and their translation is undoubtedlyworthy of great reverence.From this we can almostdivine the reason and the occasion the holy Pontiff hadfor beseeching our saint to undertake correcting theX.306THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEtranslation of the Psalms which were sung in the Churchaccording to the version of the Septuagint, forasmuch asthey were so badly set and far removed from the originalintegrity and faithfulness, that the books did not agreenor one church with the other.Some, in defence of thistranslation, allege that although deficient in some books,yet in others it was good; that what in some was wantingwould be found to exist in the others; what in some wasover and above, in others would be found removed andcorrected. And I myself do not go against this; nevertheless it does not belie the truth of what has been said,that all this difference and variety of books were full ofclear and manifest errors, from the fact of having introducedother translations in order to elucidate and correct them,and the stress that some churches followed the one andothers followed another, that some were used in one partand others in another part; so many opinions existing,and the want of conformity in all, or most of them, bothamong the Greeks as in the Latins; all these considerations must have existed in the mind of the saintly Pontiff,and moved him justly and piously, and not without anespecial impulse of the Holy Spirit—as the result demonstratéd—to lay this undertaking upon St. Jerome.Inobedience to so just and holy a request, as he himself tellsus twice in the second book of the Apologia againstRufinus, St. Jerome undertook the work, and he saysthat he left the Psalter very much amended, and was soreceived by the city of Rome.And, if I mistake not,he also says in the seventh chapter that he did the sameThisin respect to the translation of the Septuagint.first work on the Psalms, which was only a correctionof the one done by the Seventy, but which had becomeLatin and in the Greek, isso vitiated both in theApolog: contra Rufin, lib. 2, caps. 7 and 8.TRANSLATION OF THE SEPTUAGINT307called the Roman Psalter, and is the one that was used,and is still in use at the present day in the Church.Lateron, independently of this one, he made another, because,owing to the judgment or the taste and opinion of suchwriters as would not give up the old errors, this versionsoon became corrupted in what had been amended. Tothis vitiation all books at that time were very muchsubjected, owing to all having to be done by the pen.This second emendation was made at the petition ofPaula and Eustochium, but he did not call this an emendation of the first, but a new translation of the Psalms inthe Greek of the Septuagint into Latin. To this one heset lines, or, as others say, stars and asterisks in order toshow what was over and above that of the Septuagint, andwhich was not found in the Hebrew, and the stars to markwhat he had put in anew in accordance with the HebrewThis Psalter was very well received in France,truth.and Pope Damasus gave permission, as Sixtus of Siennamentions, for it to be sung in all its churches, hence itwas called the Gallican Psalter. Lastly, he effected a thirdwork on the Psalms: he translated them from the selfsameHebrew fountain into Latin, nearly word by word. Wehave no record that any use was made of this translationIn Spain it was used in the Church ofby the Church.Oran, and in some others until later times, when, with thereformed Breviary, these also adopted the Psalms whichOf this translation we shallthe whole Church sings.speak further on.From what has been said, I deem that the disputedquestion among moderns respecting the truth and fulnessof the translation of the Septuagint has been investigated,and whether it exists at the present day and whetherNotwithstandingthere was one in the time of our saint.1 Sixtus Senen. lib. 4, Biblio. verb. Hieron.308THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthat some may wish to maintain that now and in thoseearlier times there existed one which is still in its entiretyand a very good one, and others may declare that it wasnot so, nor that a trace of it has remained, yet it appearsthat a medium term may be the safer to adopt betweenthese two opinions as being more trustworthy, namely,that then and at present it existed, and that there is atranslation of the Septuagint, but so corrupted and alteredthat it seems to be another.That there may be one, andthat there was one, is undoubted, since in clear proof ofthis truththere are many testimonies cited by theancient Fathers and by the Evangelists which are read inthe self-same form in the Greek texts.Furthermore, itseems impossible that a translation so grave and so holy,so ancient and so well received in the world, should havebeen lost altogether, and that another one should haveIt also appears evident that both nowbeen preserved.and in those days it was much altered and amended,with many deficiencies and additions, and with manyThis fact our own doctor clearly proves at everyerrors.step, more especially in the Proem of the Paralipomenonand of Esdras. One reason acts very strongly in proofof this.Philo says, in the second book of the Life ofMoses, that this translation was so close to the text andso exactly made that any one knowing the two languageswould be struck with its faithfulness, each name replyingto its name, verb with verb, which is what we call tointerpret faithfully.The same does Aristaeus affirm,saying that the concordance between the Hebrew andthe Greek was admirable; and at the end of the bookwhich he wrote on this he says that, previous to thevolumes being placed in the Royal Library, a diligentexamination was made by learned men, and by them allHoratius, in Arte Poet.TRANSLATION OF THE SEPTUAGINT309was celebrated by acclamation the fidelity and holiness ofthe work, so much so that nothing was found either towithdraw or to add, on comparing the translation with theoriginal Hebrew. At present we have two impressionsof thistranslation, both made with great care anddiligence. One of these is in the body of the Royal Bible,which, at the expense and by order of the Catholic KingPhilip II., was made in Antwerp regardless of cost ortrouble—a work truly worthy of so great a prince. Thetranslation of the Septuagint which it embodies was takenfrom divers ancient copies, without following any one asbeing proper and chief among them, but solely seeking inall of them what seemed best to fit in, at times supplyingit from the Hebrew, and, lastly, having recourse always tothis fountain in all places where it appeared less exactwhat was found in the original Greek.This translation Iwould not call of the Septuagint, but a new one made fromthis collection of many by the judgment and free choiceof those who did it.Neither in the Royal Bible is therefound, nor did those who laboured in it add or erase, asingle point from what they found in the ComplutensianBible, which was printed by Cardinal Fray FranciscoJimenez, the Archbishop of Toledo, who, at an incrediblecost, had copies brought in Greek and Hebrew from Romeand all parts of the world in such sort, that there is nodifference in the Royal one but in the beauty of itscharacters, though not in the rendering of the Septuagint.Another translation from the Septuagint has been madein Rome subsequently by the authority of Sixtus V., thelabour of it and the undertaking having been entrustedto Cardinal Antonio Caraffa, Librarian of the Vatican,a very learned and pious man.This was printed inRome, in the first instance, in the Greek language in theyear 1586; the chief text of the original which was31oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEfollowed being that of the Vatican Library, which is provedto be over 12oo years old, and, as a consequence, beforethe time of Jerome, or at least not subsequent to him.there were others of Venice,originalFollowing thisFlorence, and other parts.It represents much diligence,and undoubtedly was all that could be done in order todraw forth clearly that venerable work of antiquity, theholy translation, by which the Church was created andincreased for many years, and it is quite reasonable to beheld in great veneration.I believe that, without doubt,this is the one nearest to the one which in former timeswas called by the Greeks and the holy Fathers the Common,and the Latins, as well as by our holy father St. Jeromeand others, the Vulgate, and that it was the one of theholy martyr Lucian, for which reason it was called Luciana.The Latin translation of this version was printed bythe same Cardinal Caraffa in Rome, in the year 1588,endeavours having been made to adhere to the celebratedtranslation of St. Augustine which is styled the Italian,this one being the purest and most genuine of all thosebrought out at the time, and the one which most certainlyour doctor amended, and the one that was commentedupon by him, St. Augustine, St. Ambrose, St. Hilary, andother Fathers.These are the two translations of theSeptuagint which we possess at the present day, and boththese are very far removed from being a word-for-wordtranslation of the Hebrew version, and so greatly praisedby the ancient authors which existed between them, thatthere can be no doubt but that they differed greatly fromthat which the Seventy-two had made.After this translation, which we call the first from theHebrew into Greek, there followed many others, but notuntil many years had elapsed. Aquila of Sinope, in the timeof the Emperor Adrian, made another, which is the secondTRANSLATION OF THE SEPTUAGINT31 ISubsequently there followedfrom Hebrew into Greek.the one of Symmachus and Theodotian.Symmachuswas a Samaritan in the time of Lucius Vero; Theodotianof Ephesus in the time of Commodus, a Marcionite heretic;the others were Judaizers.Later on there appeared twoothers, but without the authors' names, and were calledfifth and sixth, because they held this place not only inthe order of time, for one was in the time of Caracalla,and was found in Jericho, and the other in the time ofAlexander Severus, and found in Nicopolis, but because inthe Hexaplon and Octaplon of Origen they held that place.There was another of Lucianus, the martyr in the time ofDiocletian and Maximin, and called the seventh, and, asI have already said, was of the Septuagint, rather moreamended than the others, and which was called theVulgate and Common. Of this one itis affirmed thatsome parts have been retained in the Vulgate, which nowis the only and authentic one in the Church.ThePsalms, as we have already said, as they were correctedby St. Jerome in Rome, the respective Books of Wisdom,Ecclesiasticus, the Epistle of Jeremias, which was calledBaruch, Esther and Daniel, and some others which arenot received as authentic, as are the last ones of Esdras.Other Greek translations there were of lesser account.Some say (to return to our purpose) that the Hebrewone is wrong and not the translation of the Septuagint,hence it is nothing wonderful that it should not be inaccord with it.These men do not perceive what they say, becauseeven if the one of the Septuagint, which we now hold shouldbe one and very exact, and not with so many variations aswe have mentioned, even so, such an answer could not beallowed, because it is equal to saying that our Vulgatetranslation is erroneous, since it was translated from the312THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwithHebrew one, which they say is itself erroneous, and withwhich it accords without comparison better than with the oneof the Septuagint. Whosoever would desire further proofsof this let him read the words of our holy doctor in hisPreface on the Pentateuch, and the long Epistle to Suniaand Fratela, the Hebraic Questions, and the book DeOptimo genere Interpretandi, and the Commentaries on theProphets.

One thing do Ifind here in the translation of the Septuagint, said of thesaints, which I do not know how to explain, nor howit agrees with what we have brought forward.St.Epiphanius in his Weights and Measures, and our holyfather in the prologue of the Pentateuch, and St. Augustinein the City of God, all affirm that knowingly and of setpurpose the Seventy interpreters left out certain thingsand added others, and others, again, they altered fromwhat was in the fountain and original, and this, by theimpulse of the Holy Ghost, so as not to manifest thedivine secrets to the pagan people.I confess I donot know what to reply, because, if St. Jerome himselfand the other saints praise and hold that translationto be so divine, that they affirm that were it now asfaithful a translation as it was first made, there wouldbe nothing further to be desired, nor need to labour inmaking another, how does he bewail the great changesand alterations found inHow doesthis agree with what we have shown above of thesentence of Philo and the self-same historian and witness of the fact, Aristaeus, who both declare the accuracyand harmony to be divine, and that the examinationwas great which was made by learned men, and allacclaimed the religious fidelity found in the translation?How was it they did not see the faults, the additions, andthe alterations?Moreover, there is a thing which confirms me in not believing this, that, if they kept silentor changed in order not to reveal the divine secrets insome places, how is it that others remained so clear andyet of greater importance?For certainly in respect tothose that remained, such as were omitted and changedoriginal?the1 August. 18 Book, De Civitate Dei, caps. 43 and 44.TRANSLATION OF THE SEPTUAGINT315must have been very few, and not of equal power by far.This can only be replied to by saying that the saintspiously sought some explanation to excuse the many deficiencies which were perceived in those times in the textof the Septuagint, for although they translated faithfullyand religiously, yet by the action of time and the laxity of thecopyists, that clear truth and purity became contaminated.Our doctor in the places quoted of the preface on thePentateuch does not speak as his own verdict, but as thethat the Seventyopinion of some Jews, who statedinterpretersKing Ptolemy themysteries of the Divinity and the plurality of the personsin order that it should not seem that they had departedIt is not my office to pointfrom the sentence of Plato.detail the errors and the differences of thisout intranslation.I only claim by this discourse to show theurgent occasion for the pious labours of this doctor, andthe great service he thereby rendered our Holy motherthe Church.concealed fromhadIf any one would wish to enter further into the matterI would refer him to the various authors and books citedalready, where he will find so many details that he will beamply satisfied.

All these falsehoods he gatheredtogether, and made up a fictitious letter purporting tohave been written by Jerome himself, in which he statedthem.to what on this matterSt. Jerome declares, so that in his own words we shouldreply to both these accusations.In the second book ofthe Apologia against Rufinus he says as follows:"—Let us now listen“Brother Eusebius writes to me that he found in thepossession of the Bishop of Africa a letter purporting tohave been written by me, in which I did penance andretracted and affirmed that men had induced me when Iwas a young man to translate into Latin the Hebrewbooks, in all which there is no truth whatever.I was struckwith horror on hearing this, and whereas truth is to befound in the mouths of two or three, and one onlywitness, although he should be Cato himself, would beno authority, some other brothers who were in the samecity wrote to me, asking me with great insistence if thiscould be true, declaring, with tears in their eyes, who itwas that had divulged this Epistle.If he could dareto act like this, what can there be he would not dare todo?Despite that malice has not such power as desire,yet doubtless innocence and virtue would perish were theyto run equally with wickedness, and then power andmalice would attain what they would.

Thus it happens that he whocounterfeited the Epistle under the name of my penance, Iam also told reprehends me because my motive in interpreting the Holy Scriptures was none other than to condemnthe Septuagint in such sort that, whether it be true what Ihave translated, or whether it be false, I cannot be free ofcrime, because I confess that in this my new work I haveerred, or because the new translation does naught elsebut condemn the old one.I greatly marvel how in thatEpistle he did not make me a homicide, an adulterer,sacrilegious and a parricide, and all else that turpitudecould imagine and evolve within a mind.I feel constrained to thank him for this much, that, amid sucha tangle of sins, he only accused me of the crimes offalsehood and of error.”After this he goes on to say how greatly he had alwaysheld in esteem the Seventy, how he studied and expoundedtheir translations, making use of this work in all his writings in order to show that never did it enter his head towrite or translate with the object of reprehending them;because, to the contrary, he held their words as very highand divine, and his own work as very low. He comparesthe former to the gold and the silk that were offered inthe ancient tabernacle, and his own to the goat's hair andthe hair cloth with which the tabernacle was covered; andthat his aim was no other than to give the Latin Churchand his own brethren the truth and the purity of thedivine letters according as he found it in the fountain andin the truth of the Hebrew text—to reveal the sacramentsof our faith; what things Christ and His apostles hadwritten and taught, which things were neither found in thetexts of the Septuagint nor in the others.318THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEAll this he proves with clear words and manifestexamples. And in the prefaces on the Paralipomenon hesays as follows: “The apostles and evangelists were wellaware of, and well read in, the version of the Seventyinterpreters.From whence did it come to them to declareso many things as we have cited which are not found inthe Septuagint? And our Redeemer Jesus Christ, Authorof both Testaments, in the gospel of St. John" says: ‘Hethat believeth in me, as the scriptures say, out of his bellyUndoubtedly whatshall flow rivers of living waters.Christ said was written, must indeed have been writtendown.But where is it written ?

He goes on torefer what he had said in the prologue on the Psalter toSophronius, and declares again that he does not effect thetranslation in order to reprehend the Septuagint, but toconvince the Jews, who might wish to argue, not to bringforward what they used to say to Sophronius; so that whenthey quoted the Scriptures from the translation of theSeptuagint they would at once say, “It is not so in theHebrew.”Likewise I wish to point out another bold allegation ofthis modern writer.Against the common consent of alllearned and pious men up to the present time, he wishesto say that the translation of the Psalms, as is found inthe works of St. Jerome, which he made conformablywith the truth of the Hebrew text (as the saint himself acknowledges he did), is really not his own, andthis assertion he puts forward without giving any reasonfor this blind whim of his.Ever since the works ofSt. Jerome have been diffused throughout the world, thesePsalms have been received as his work without contradiction whatever, and in truth they are worthy of the author;and, indeed, in those far remote times there was no one toReturning to the aim of our purpose, whichattain to this.is to manifest that St. Jerome never swerved from the reverence in which he held the Seventy-two interpreters, but thathis holy and pure intention was to give the Church theLeon Castro, mille in locis apologet.32oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEtruth of the sacred books, drawing it forth from the limpidfountain; and if in the translation of the Septuagint it isfound otherwise, it is not any fault to discover what hefound there; this he confirms later on in this same bookagainst Rufinus' by the preface which he wrote upon Isaias.He goes on to say that the book of Daniel was so corruptedin the Septuagint that already in his time that translationwas not read in the Church, but the one of Theodotian.He concludes at the end of this book with the example ofmany other things which in the Hebrew text were verydifferent to the text of the Septuagint, as in the words ofthe 22nd Psalm :* Deus meus, Deus meus, quare me dereliquisti ? And he says the Septuagint added Respice in me,and many other things in this way. He concludes withthese words: “I do not say this to discredit the Seventyinterpreters, but because the authority of Christ and ofHis apostles is greater; for where the translation of theSeptuagint offers no discrepancy with the Hebrew originalthey allege their translation and employ it; and whereit differs, or is wanting, they put in Greek what theyhad taken from the Hebrew.Let my adversary andaccuser do similarly, and in the same way as I haveshown that there are many things in the New Testamentwhich are not in the Septuagint but exist in the Hebrew,so also let him show me passages in the New Testamentof the Seventy interpreters which are not in the Hebrewtext, and I will acknowledge myself at fault (and this is avery telling reason for the moderns of our times who sogreatly uphold the Septuagint). From the whole of thisdiscourse it remains proved that the translation of theseancients (which from the antiquity of its use is confirmed)Contra Rufin. cap. 9.This, Leon Castro passed over, although he set the title of the Psalm and thefollowing verse.TRANSLATION OF THE SEPTUAGINT32 Iis very useful in the Church, since by it the Gentiles heardthat Christ was to come, before He came, and that not forthat are all other interpreters to be reprobated, becausethey do not translate their own words but those that are inthe divine books.”Up to this are the words of the saint. From thiswe shall understand his mind and the holy motiveswhich he had in this undertaking, and theerror ofthose who imagine that he retracted having said thatthe Septuagint was very vitiated and corrupted in histime, be the cause whatever it may. And it is also mademanifest how foolish it is for men to say, that owing to thisthe Hebrew text should be emended and be printed withthis correction, and then translate it word by word asPagninus did, and others have sought to do, for this wouldbe to translate not divine words, but human thoughts. Indeed through not understanding the thread and coherence ofthe sentence and text of the holy writing, they resorted toallegories and a mystical sense in order to escape from thedifficulties in which they found themselves. We haveconsidered the first work of our doctor in the translationand emendation of the Psalms, and what there is in theGreek translations, their number, antiquity, and authority,and what is the feeling of St. Jerome on this question.DISCOURSE THE FOURTHMotives which urged St. Jerome to undertake the translationof the Scriptures into Latin from the Hebrew Text. TheTruth and Fulness of the Text.Proofs are broughtforward that the Vulgate Translation is St. Jerome's.HAvING commenced the question of the translations madeby the glorious St. Jerome from the Hebrew into Latin,and not wishing to have to revert to the same subject, wedeem it better in this discourse to bring the matter to aconclusion.The service rendered by our doctor to the Church bythis labour was a very great one, and one for which wehave the greatest gratitude to offer, because after thelabours of the first princes of the Church, who were theIn the formerapostles, there is nothing of higher esteem.discourse we have presented some of the causes whichmust have urged him to carry out this work, but we merelytouched upon them in passing, because we were proceedingforward with another aim, but in this discourse it will be useful to reveal them all here collectively from his own words.To me the strongest argument of all, and the one which satisfies me in the belief that there was wanting in Holy Churchan edition of the Scriptures with all that fidelity and puritywhich was required, was to witness the great impulse ofthe Holy Spirit which was moving so strongly this doctor322MOTIVES FOR TRANSLATING THE SCRIPTURES323to undertake so great a labour, so difficult a scheme, soarduous a task, without fear of contradiction, with a braveheart, ready to break lances with his adversaries and foilthem all. And this is clearly seen to be the fact when webehold the Church putting aside what for so many yearsshe had held, and with which she had been nourished andtaught, that is to say, the version of the Septuagint, andall others of those times, which were many, and leavingthem all aside, adopting the translation of one individualAnd in such a manner didalone—that of a Jerome !Holy Church continue to follow it all through the agesthat the Holy Ghost made known to His spouse by theformal declaration in the Council of Trent, at which Itassisted, that this one translation of St. Jerome should beheld as authentic, the only one which with its testimoniesshould qualify holy dogmas and doctrines. The Churchdoes not condemn the other translations, for they are ofgreat profit and are, as it were, native commentaries, whichdiscover the pregnancy and bring to light great conceptions; but she does not wish them to have that authorityand that force with which she invested the one sprung fromthe hands of Jerome, the Vulgate, proved by the testimonyof so many ages.Let us say that the first motive was thecommand of Pope Damasus who, as chief and head of theChurch, ordered him to do so, because, acting under thisprinciple of obedience, all goes in harmony, and that themotive of the Pontiff in beseeching Jerome was at theimpulse and the assistance of the Holy Ghost in theinterior sense; and in the exterior, the sight of the dissensions, variety, and dissonance which we have pointedout existed in the translation of the Septuagint, all ofwhich could be remedied by Jerome bringing out a translation from the Hebrew original fount and truth.It was from that source that the first translators had324THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEif by the action of time and its inevitabledrawn it,changes, which in truth alters and obliterates all things, itFrom that same original sourcehad not also obscured it.will St. Jerome bring its truth forth to the world, becausehe will not approach that fount of Hebrew truth with anysmaller vessel and spirit than they did to collect it.Thisreason did the doctor himself point out in the prologue of theParalipomenon in the words already quoted above. “Werethe translation of the Septuagint,” he says, writing to Chromatius, “in the original purity in which they had left it, asuperfluous thing it would be to ask me to make anothertranslation.” Then follows what he says in the prologueon Job. “Let those who bark at me,” he says, “listen toItthe reason which moved me to translate this book.was not the wish to reprehend the ancient translation ofthe Septuagint, but that the things which are in it obscure,or which were not said, or rather through the maliceor deficiency of the copyists, became debased, shouldremain with our translation, clear and manifest.” Thethird reason we touched upon already. The Jews used tojeer when, the Catholics approached them, wishing tomanifest to them their perfidy and blindness with theThey would bring out thepower of the Scriptures.Septuagint; they found a great want of harmony betweenthe places quoted in the Greek and those which they knewwell in their own text; and whereas the incorruptibilityof their Scriptures was held so certain, they would take nonotice of what was quoted to them, rather they scorned us,and by merely saying, “that is not so in the Hebrew,” theysilenced every one. We have touched on what occurredto Sophronius and the Jew, for which reason did he sourgently insist that our saint should make the translationof the Psalms from the Hebrew into Latin. At the endof the above prologue St. Jerome expresses himself inMOTIVES FOR TRANSLATING THE SCRIPTURES325this manner when writing to the same Sophronius.“It isone thing to sing the Psalms in Church with the faithful ofChrist, and another to reply to the infidel Jews who wishto depreciate this Word.”Also, it is a deep consideration that whereas in theLatin Church exists the Head and the true Vicar of Christ,to which resort must be had for the pure and wholesomedoctrine, and the perfect comprehension of the holyScriptures, it is in reason that in the Latin Church thereshould in like manner be the divine letters used, whichshould be translated with the utmost fidelity from theoriginal fount, without recourse being had for them to theGreek Church.The Greek Church was unduly arrogant on thatoccasion, and even allowed herself to say that if thereexisted anything of good in the Western Church and inher doctors it had been taken and learned from her.Allthis became altered with the translation of our Jerome,and these lofty spirits were greatly humbled, translatingthe same holy Scriptures, on being convinced of its truth,from Latin into Greek, a thing they had never thought ofdoing. And if the times and the histories of that epochare investigated we will find that ever since this translationof St. Jerome commenced to be used in the Church,the Latin doctors worked so advantageously that theysurpassed the Greek ones, even as they themselves hadformerly excelled the Latins.We will touch upon this motive with the words of ourholy doctor, where he says as follows upon Esdras: “Howmuch more grateful should the Latins be to me, since theybeheld that through my translation the arrogance ofGreece has been humbled so far as to take already someIn the same prologue hething from the Latin Church !”adds another consideration and motive, which is of no326THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEsmall weight. He says that at least his translation hasthis advantage—it saves great expense, and removes theoccasion of many disputes and dissensions.First, becauseit were necessary, without it, to quote many volumes,gather together many translations and copies, whichbeing all in manuscript at that epoch, were of great priceand costly to obtain, the quotations having to be madeonly by much labour and a vast expenditure of wealth, notonly as regards the translations of the Septuagint, but ofmany others by which the deficiences had been corrected,because no one trusted solely to them alone; and to dothis would be needed those of Aquila, Symmachus,Theodotian, and the others already mentioned of Origen,Lucianus, and Hesychius, fifth, sixth, seventh, and hundreth,an undertaking of infinite expense, not only of wealthbut of time and life.Furthermore, to collate and compare some copies with others, a thing which would beneeded at every step, would involve endless labour. Thesecond and worst of all, that after this cost and labournought would come from it but an occasion for dissensionand confusion; because the knowledge of the originalHebrew language being wanting, what judgment could besafely formed amid such a medley of Greek translations?The more the research, the more they would err; bymultiplying translations they also multiplied dissensions.An example of this is afforded in the above-cited prologueto Esdras which the saint notices.” “Of a learned man ofthe Greeks, whom I suspect was Apollinaris, it is saidthat, although very erudite, yet through not knowingthe Hebrew language, he oftentimes failed in following themeaning of the holy Scriptures, and proceeded to adoptthe error of any interpreter, who came to hand. By thistranslation and pious undertaking, all these encounters and1 Praefatio in Esdr. circa finem.MOTIVES FOR TRANSLATING THE SCRIPTURES 327dissensions would be obviated, which were constantly occurring in the House of the Lord, whose borders are peace.For despite that in the supposition of all agreeing toaccept the version of the Septuagint, there would arise thedifficulty of selecting one out of the variety which is found,now that it numbers some hundred versions.Because, asthe saint said in the prologue of the Paralipomenon,Alexandria and the whole of Egypt laud the one ofHesychius, the priest of Jerusalem.Constantinople andall Asia Minor, as far as Antioch, read that translationwhich had been most emended, which one, as we haveseen, is that of Lucianus Martyr, which version hasalso extended as far as Rome, and through the LatinChurch, the seventh called the Vulgate and commonone, of Lucianus, the priest of Antioch, and afterwardsBishop of Nicomedia; whilst Palestine and all that partbetween these extremes celebrated the one emended byEusebius and Pamphylius, following the careful versionof Origen.All this was obviated by the labour of St.Jerome.And let it be as a conclusion and end of all thesethoughts and reasons which moved him to break throughthe dilemma, and open a path to all Latins, for them toattempt the mastering of tongues, especially the Hebrew,which had been hitherto deemed inaccessible to them.He was the first of all we have any record of who vanquished this difficulty; after him came others, trusting sohappy and saintly a guide, and at length the way ofacquiring the Hebrew has been made so straight, so muchso that none can be acquired with greater brevity, and thestudy of this language has flourished in the RomanChurch to such a degree that an infinite number of thingsof great depth and importance in our faith have beencleared up and made known, a fact which the Greek328THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEAll this we owe to St.Church never attained to do.Jerome; all these are benefits obtained of him, and as histhey are acknowledged by all learned men, who even holdhim before their eyes as their patron and example. Oursaint touched also on this motive in the Apologia againstRufinus in the above-cited place. On this account, andfor all those other reasons the holy Pope Damasus andthose who succeeded him, ordained that it should be readin the Latin Church, and that it should be received as agift and a mercy sent from heaven, setting aside that ofthe Septuagint and all others of minor authority.Andlet it be observed that from the times of St. Augustineonwards no doctor has commented or written upon anyother translation but that of St. Jerome, although at timesthey may have taken advantage of the others, but nomore than as a help.From this, unless I view it wrongly, remains determined in my opinionthat question which manythink of great account, whether or not the text of theHebrew became corrupted or erroneous through themalice of the Jews.Certainly those who affirm it do notview it in the right light, that it was falsified in timesprevious to those of our doctor St. Jerome, and in suchsort that there remained no prophecy of Jesus Christ butwhich was dimmed by some falsity and error.I wouldask them, If this be so, how or what kind of translationThe Vulgatewould St. Jerome bring out from it?translation, which the Church now uses, and has done sofor so many ages back St. Jerome drew from the Hebrew;if that was tainted and corrupted it could not, withoutdoubt, come out a clear version nor a true one; forsooth, afine version of the holy Scriptures would the Church holdLeon Castro in Apologet. lib. 1, cap. 1, et per totum opus; Cano, de locis, lib. 2,cap. 13; Jacob. Christopolitanus, prefatio in Salm.TRUTH AND FULNESS OF TEXT329in the opinion of such men.St. Jerome, when writing onthe 6th chapter of Isaias, says: “If any one should say thatafter the coming of Christ and the preaching of theapostles and publication of the gospels, the Hebrew bookswere falsified, let him hear Origen, who replies to this inthe 8th volume upon Isaias.” And the reply consists inthis deep reason by which our doctor became convinced,and so will any one else be convinced.If the Hebrewsfalsified the writing and effected this before the coming ofChrist or after—if before, why then did not Christ and theapostles reprehend them as falsifiers, and pointed them outas guilty of a grave crime, as they had reprehended othersfor what in comparison to this crime was much less grave?Had this been the case, our Lord would not have toldthem through St. John, Search carefully the Scriptures,because they give testimony of Me, rather He would havesaid, “The Scriptures which spoke of Me you have corrupted,or you will do so later on.”Such as should desire to enter further into this subjectof the disputes in regard to various translations may do wellto read Driedo" in the second volume of his dogmas of theChurch and of the Scriptures, and many other modernswho have taken up this question and made it their study,because as for my purpose, which was to make manifestthe reasons for the pious labours of this glorious doctor,and what moved him to undertake them, I think I havesaid enough.It is, however, necessary, in order to complete fullythe aim of this discourse, to investigate what appertains tothe history of the saint, whether the Vulgate translationwhich the Church holds, and has used so many years up tothe present, is the same which St. Jerome made.ShouldDriedo, 2 Dog.

The defence of this part has been undertaken bysome of the learned men of our time, and they have removedall, or nearly all, the labour from the shoulders of others bytheir erudition and deep study of history, and therefore I willdo no more than briefly gather together what will suffice tome for this purpose; whosoever would wish to go into thisin a more extended form may consult those works whichare at hand."In order not to be disturbed by the opinions and thereasons of a few who hold that it is not Jerome's, we willproceed to consider it in parts.inholyIt seems undoubted that the New Testament is atranslation of his, and that at least itis the one heemended and corrected from the Greek text; and fromhis own writings itis gathered, because in all placesancientdoctor reprehendsthewhichtranslation, which was in use in his time, we find themcorrected as he said they should be corrected. These aremanifest, and there is no need to refer to them in detail;and modern writers who have treated on this subjectrepeat the same thing. The doctor, when speaking of hisown writings in his book on the Illustrious Men, says thatthe New Testment was by him restored to its first andprimitive sense, and that the Old Testament he hadFrom thistranslated according to the Hebrew text.the1 Auctores supra citati.TRUTH AND FULNESS OF TEXT331some" have argued that he did not make a translation,but an emendation, since he distinguishes between theOld and the New Testament, saying that the one was atranslation and the other a restoration to its originalentirety. And in the prologue to St. Damasus on the FourGospels he says as follows: “You compel me to make anew translation of the Old Testament, and that after somany copies of the Scriptures are scattered throughout theworld I should enter in as judge, and that whereas theyare all in disagreement I should determine which, or what,is what best corresponds with the truth of the Greek text,a pious work, but a dangerous presumption to judge othersby one who is to be judged by all.”Farther on he says: “The present little preface onlypromises the four gospels, the order of which is Matthew,Mark, Luke, and John, emended, comparing them andcollating them with the Greek books and with those of theancients in order not to deviate much from the Latinversion in use; and in such a manner do we temper andmoderate them that on correcting the places in which thesense appeared altered, all else remained as it was.” Thesame does he repeat on the canonical epistles in a prologueto the virgin Eustochium. “Many days ago,” he says,“did we correct the gospels according to the truth of theGreek text.”From these passages and testimonies itseems a more proper manner of speaking to say that heemended the New Testament rather than that he madea new translation.But in whichever sense we may take itwe can well say that it is all his own, because what he tookaway was taken away, and what he judged right to takeand read from the ancient, that remained and was read,and is read now.That all this was ordered to be received throughout1 Pagnin. Prefatio in Bibl. Paulus Sempronius, lib. 2.332THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe Church by Pope Damasus, at whose petition Jeromehad effected that version, and that it was accepted in itsentirety, appears to be gathered from an epistle whichSt. Augustine wrote to St. Jerome, where he says thathistranslation and emendation was collated with theGreek text when anything new occurred, and that it wasfound to be most faithfully done in the original Greek,so as to convince all.From this may be gatheredthat in those days the New Testament was alreadyin the hands of all, under the title of the emendedtranslation of St. Jerome, and it will be found thatno author, whether ancient or modern, puts aside thistranslation or ignores it, nor that any other was received,and therefore as a consequence there is no reason fordoubting that the New Testament of our Vulgate had anyother author for its translation but St. Jerome.Some say that there are passages found which are notcorrected, as the saint said they should be.In the epistlesto the Galatians and the Ephesians and to Titus thereI reply that in the prologueare passages where he says so.of the gospels quoted above, written to Damasus, he confesses that he did not correct all he saw could be corrected,so that it should not appear that he altered many things,and be thought over particular; and it might be that whenhe was writing the commentaries on these same Epistles hemight have deemed that it were well to alter them, yetsubsequently, when viewing it in another light, he judgedbest to leave them as they were, and not effect so great achange from the ancient version. And it stands true thathe wrote these commentaries before he made the translation of the New Testament, for he himself says so whenspeaking of his works and writings in the book on Illustrious Men. And now it is seen from these same passagesAugust. Epist. Io.AUTHORSHIP OF VULGATE TRANSLATION333that the Vulgate translation which he made is more inconformity to the Greek text than the one he wished tocorrect when commenting in regard to the translation ofthe Old Testament. We have already said that the Psalmsare from the translation of the Septuagint, correctedby him carefully twice over, and not the translation hemade into Latin, which is to be found among his works,nor the one he made from the Greek, according as it wasin the originals of Origen.This is manifestly so from theEpistle to Sunia and Fratela, where he sets many verseswhich are expressed in a very different manner in theSeptuagint from what he had emended; and that which isfound in the Vulgate is the one he emended, and thereforeis also called Vulgate and Common, as we proved above.Thus likewise it appears evident that the books of Wisdom,Ecclesiasticus, Machabees, and others we have already referred to, are not his translation, but were those thatremained from the ancient and common one.And thisis proved because never did the saint mention havingtranslated them, nor is there found any prologue uponthem. And in an Epistle to St. Augustine" he affirmsthat to all the books he translated he made a prologue.He did not wish to work upon these because he did nothold them authentic, rather he reckoned them among theapocryphal ones, as is seen in the Prologue to the Galatiansand the Prologue on Proverbs. St. Cyprian” and other saintsquote many passages in these books with the same translation as we have now, and some of these were in timesprevious to St. Jerome; whence is seen that the ancientAll theone remained without the saint approaching it.rest of the books of the Old Testament as it stands in theThis isVulgate are his translation from the Hebrew.Epist. 11, Inter Epistolas 8, August.Cyprian, Lib. de Exhortation Martyrii.334THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEFirst and foremost, that St.proved by many reasons.Jerome was the first and only one among the ancients whotranslated the Old Testament from the Hebrew into Latin.This translation is clearly seen to have been from theHebrew, with the exception of the books we have mentioned, and there is to all appearances no doubt that it wasIn all his prologues he complains of, and replies to,his.his adversaries who reprehend him for daring to undertakethis work, since it had never been attempted by any Latin.From those remote ages we have no notice of any author,who, I do not say made a translation, but who even somuch as knew the Hebrew language; and if this be not.so, let our opponents tell us who he was.From someEpistles of St. Augustine, and from his books of the Cityof God, this is proved. St. Isidore” says as much. LikewiseSt. Gregory, the Pope, allows it to be seen how it agreeswith the Hebrew and how greatly it differs from the Greek,and it is clearly gathered that it did not come forth fromthis streamlet, but that it was collected from the fount.In the reckoning and manner of counting the years thesame thing is found, because in the Greek it is very muchin error, more especially in cap. v. in Genesis; while inour translation it corresponds well with the Hebrew text.To those who love the truth, and are obedient to theHoly Church of Rome, the determination of the HolyCouncil of Trent is sufficient, for it bids us receive themas authentic, and as for the rebels, disobedient, and evilminded, neither reason nor authority are of any avail, sinceall the virtues departed with their loss of faith, leaving themunbridled to say what is abhorrent to the pious and thesingle minded, and only fit for their own evil hearts. Many,as saintly as they were erudite, have replied to theseAugust. Epist. 8 and Io, lib. 18, De Civit. cap. 43.Isidore, Etymolog, cap. 5.AUTHORSHIP OF VULGATE TRANSLATION335opponents, and in order to remove all occasion to the evilminded, two supreme pontiffs, Sixtus V. and Clement VIII.,ordained, in fulfilment of the ordinances of the Holy Council,to have a Bible printed with the Vulgate translation, withoutthe varied lessons, selecting (as it may be believed withgreat prudence) the most coherent and best received lessons.And in it will be found nothing but what is in harmonywith the Christian religion and the doctrine taught by theHoly Roman Church, which she carries written not aloneon parchments and paper, but engraved on the livingtables of her heart by the very finger of God, which isHis Holy Spirit.Let this suffice which we have briefly stated, and wewill proceed in the history of the saint's life, and considerwhen and on what occasions he translated the books of theholy Scriptures. He did not translate them all in Rome,nor was it possible that St. Damasus should have seenthem all translated, nor even the greater portion of thebooks, as we shall clearly prove. The New Testament,the Psalms, and some others he may have seen done, aswe have already stated.DISCOURSE THE FIFTHSt. Jerome translates the Sacred Scriptures into Slavonic.He arranges the Divine OfficeAT this point of our history it becomes opportune to consideranother very pious and holy work which St. Jerome undertook in regard to the sacred Scriptures, and by so doing wewill fulfil our promise of concluding the subject.Some authors state that he also translated the holybooks from the Hebrew into the Slavonic tongue, thisbeing the common language spoken in his native place.I believe he undertook this labour and brought it to aconclusion whilst dwelling in Rome. This appears plausible,forasmuch as his own compatriots must have become awarethat he had left the desert and had returned from Syria tothe holy city, that he held a distinguished position, andwas renowned for his sanctity and doctrine, since his famehad penetrated to every part; and it is quite in reason thatthey should have sought him out, wishing to converse withhim, being as he was of such noble parents, relatives, andWhether it was because he was besought by hisfriends.own countrymen, or because the saint was grieved atwitnessing so much barbarism, so little refinement, not onlyin the customs of ordinary life, but in the religious one,that, burning with the ardent desires for working good forthe salvation of souls—the service of God—in order that336TRANSLATION OF THE SCRIPTURES INTO SLAVONIC 337His holy laws should be made known, considering himselfa debtor to the uninstructed as well as to the learned,placed as he had been by God in the Church, he undertook three works of great labour and of much fruit onbehalf of that people. The first was to invent and formcharacters, proper letters for them to write their ownIt was different from the rest, from the Hebrew,language.and the Greek, and the Latin, not only in speech andaccent, but even in substance, without any analogy tothem, and therefore it was well that it should differ alsoin the form of the letters. That people were so plungedin barbarism and bereft of culture that they neither knewhow to read or write their own tongue.There was nothingmore required of our holy patriarch to do but this work inorder that it might be said of him that in all things whichwere rare and exceptional in letters he was truly unique.In the knowledge of theology and the sacred Scriptureshe was equal to the best, and none exceeded him, sinceamong the greatest he was master.In the contemplationof moral and natural philosophy the best of the Greekscould not excel him.In the knowledge of tongues andvariety of erudition there was no one of his time to compare with him, nor indeed in previous ages. He onlyneeded to be the inventor of new characters and letters,and be, so to say, the father of some new languagein order to be the equal of the celebrated Cadmus ofPhoenicia, inventor of letters according as the world hasreceived it—I know not whether this question has been wellunderstood or investigated — of Palamedes, Simonides,Epicarmus of Greece, of Toot or Taanto of the Egyptians,and so worthy of having applied to him the two versiclesof Zeno in praise of the first:—Sum patria Phoenix, quis livor? sum tamen illeCadmus, cui debet Graecia tota libros.338THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEAnd of our doctor we can well say, not only that theSlavonians owe to him all books, but all the Church. Thesecond labour was to set in order the divine office in thesame language for them, the manner of conducting prayerin the Church, the celebration of mass and all appertaining to the Christian doctrine under the same order andskill as he had arranged in the Latin Church for hersupreme head, which is Rome, to the great glory of thatcountry. The third labour of his was to translate all thebooks of the Bible into the same language, in order thatthese Slavonians should not be deprived of so great atreaSure.Blondo, in his book De Italia Illustrata, when treatingon the eleventh region, which is Istria, says as follows:“There are many who believe that St. Jerome was anative of Dalmatia because he was the inventor of theletters they use, which are different from the Latin and theGreek, and which subsequently were called Slavonic by thepeople who anciently in Germany were called Slavoniansand now are called Bohemians. And not alone did heinvent and compose letters for those peoples, but he alsotranslated from the Greek into this new language thedivine office, which Christians universally use even now.This boon was confirmed to them by Eugenius IV. ofglorious memory, the matter having passed through ourhands on the occasion when in Florence the union waseffected of the Greeks and Armenians; and the Jacobites,Nestorians, and Ethiopians received from the same PopeEugenius the laws and decrees by which they were to beclearlygoverned.”gathered how well established it was in all Dalmatia,Pannonia, and Bohemia, that St. Jerome had effected theselabours and given the people these books, since with nomanner of doubt did they acknowledge them as his. AndFrom these words of Blondo isTRANSLATION OF THE SCRIPTURES INTO SLAVONIC 339whereas he arranged for them, and translated the divineoffice, as it was generally recited in the Church, into thatsingular language and new writing, therefore he must alsohave done the same with the holy Scriptures, of which, aswe have seen above, the whole was recited and read duringthe course of the year. And in those times the lessons werenot so short or so curtailed as they are now (this being dueto our own tepidity and want of fervour); rather there wasnothing left in the book which contained the lessons butwhich was read.Let it be understood that the Church hasnever absolutely prohibited the translation of the sacredScriptures into the common languages, for the catalogueordered to be made by Pius V. in the fourth ruling permitsthe perusal of the holy Scriptures in the vernacular to suchas in the opinion of the prelates might be a source ofspiritual profit.Holy Church does not wish holy writto be handled except with great reverence, nor madecommon, nor that in the use of the Church and her officesthe lessons which are worthy of the highest reverencebe read in the common language—this is also a sentence inthe Tridentine Council, but only in those three languageswhich it pleased God to honour by placing them in thetitle of the Cross at His Crucifixion, viz.: Hebrew, Greek,and Latin—in which languages from the beginning theholy book had been written.It is a singularly admirablefact and worthy of consideration, that never have the sacredScriptures been read or sung in the divine office in anylanguage which could be called common to all, neitheramong the Jews nor among the Greeks or the Latins,for when the Scriptures have been read in the temples andsynagogues few of the people understood them, and wehave clear proof that since the time of Esdras at least theFromsacred language was not common to the Jews.Session 22, cap. 8 et 9.34oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEchapter viii. of the second book of this great scribe itstands that the Scriptures were read in Hebrew and not inSyriac or Chaldean, and that it was not understood unlessit was explained to them; and therein it is said that thepeople greatly rejoiced when Esdras and the Levitesexplained to them the law.Since that time until thepresent in all the synagogues the Testament is read inHebrew, which is understood only by the teachers whostudy it carefully.the prologue toAs regards the Greek language we also find that in thetime of our saintly doctor throughout the east, the translation of the Septuagint was read under the divers correctionsof Lucianus, Origen, and Hesychius. We also know thatthe Greek language was not common in all the provincestherein referred—Antioch, Egypt, Syria, and Palestine;while in Galatia, which stands between Antioch and Constantinople, Greek was not spoken, but a kind of Frenchor a language derived from Trèves, a place on theconfines of Germany and France, as the saintly doctorthe Galasays intians.' Who it was who took this language there, andhow, will be shown later.Syria had a language of itsown, Egypt also.Our saint says that the great FatherAnthony wrote some epistles in the mother tongue ofEgypt. De Efren says that he wrote many things inSyriac, and here in this royal library of San Lorenzo areextant his homilies, with letters and in a language whichare now used by the Armenians.And what is more,Pontus, Cappadocia, Asia Minor, Phrygia, and Pamphylia,despite that the language spoken there resembles somewhat the Greek, nevertheless varies so much that thepeople of the different places can scarcely understand eachother.

Our saint gives us to understand that in theBalearic Isles there was spoken a language which was halfGreek, at least this was the case after the Goths enteredinto Spain when the Romans left in her were exterminated, now more than a thousand years ago, Latinbecame so little used and so forgotten through the preponOnderance of the Goths that it became very rare.the other hand the Moors of Africa by their entry destroyedwhat relics remained, and poor Spain became filled withuncouth languages and barbaric expressions of whichshe will never again be altogether freed.England andScotland (called under the name of Albion or BritannidesCyprian, Sermo de Oratione Dominica.August. 2 De Doctr. Christian. c. 13.342THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEby Dionysius and Ptolemy) have had many changes oflanguage, yet never have they had the sacred Scripturesmade in any of them but only in the Latin, as is affirmedby Bede’ in the first book of the history of these peoples.The same is affirmed by Waldensis.” In France it was thesame, never was the Latin tongue a common language, asis proved by Albinus Flaccus Alcuin, the preceptor ofCharlemagne in the book On the Divine Offices, andAmalarion who flourished in the year 840.That inGaul (many provinces are included under this name)there should have been many differences of the commonlanguage is a thing well known by every one, and some ofthese languages are said to be of such antiquity that it hasbeen even said they were previous to Latin and Greek,and that these had their origin from them.” Our greatFather, to whom naught that was good of ancient timeswas unknown, says in the second prologue to the Epistleto the Galatians, that previous to the occupation of theGauls by the Franks, Latin was very different to that ofthe Gallic language, which is a good argument in supportIn Italy without doubt the sacredof its antiquity.Scriptures were always read in the Church and divineoffices in the Latin tongue, and the order of the officeswas the same as now since the times of our saint, as wehave already proved.Latin was not, nor ever has been,common there, but there have been other commonRadevicus, an historian of some centurieslanguages.back, in the Book ii. of the Deeds of Frederic says thatat the election of Pope St. Victor the people cried inacclamation Papa Victore Sante Pietro Pelgge, whence itis seen how debased the Roman tongue was at the time in1 Beda, l.

Anglic. cap. i.Waldens. t. 3, Sacrament. tit. 3 et 4.Gorop. in Hermaten.Radevicus, lib. 2, cap. 20.TRANSLATION OF THE SCRIPTURES INTO SLAVONIC 343Rome.St. Thomas Aquinas, writing some hundred ofyears back in his commentaries on chapter xiv. of theEpistle to the Corinthians, says that in his time it wasquite another language which was spoken by the peoplecommonly, to the one in which the Scriptures were read inthe Churches.From all this discourse we have clearly seen that inthe Church, universally speaking, the sacred Scriptureshave not been read but in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin;and this fact admits of no manner of doubt or exception.Moreover, that these three languages are very rare, andnever been vulgar and common, in this way, that to thepeople they should be as common as those they familiarlyspeak and converse in, but that they have a distinctionand separation as a fact of especial consideration andmystery, as things set apart, which suffices to confoundthe hardihood of those who feel to the contrary, and wouldwish to profane the divine mysteries; and an all-sufficingargument to quiet the desires of some of the faithful, who,under the plea of zeal for some good, but not according toscience, wish to introduce this, for it is clearly seen thatGod has never willed to permit this in any period, or time,or nation, and it is well that these should conform theirwills and their purposes to what is manifestly by a longexperience the will of God and the desire of the Church.If St. Jerome translated the Scriptures into the commonlanguage of Slavonia, it was to remedy, in his great zeal,the native uncouthness of the inhabitants of that country.This in truth was the intention of our saint in undertakingthese labours and holy occupations, although he does notactually point it out in his works.This subject of theSlavonic language is so strange and obscure that such ashave striven their utmost to investigate the origin of theGothic nations and northern countries cannot come to any344THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEexplanation, and admit their ignorance of its antiquity andits character.I believe that they themselves ignore it.Probably the Slavonians, being ignorant of their ownantiquity and the derivation and origin of their tongueand characters, in the time of Eugenius IV. were mindedto take for their patron St. Jerome, and exalt theircountry and language by the labours of so great a saint.The fact of the Slavonians having in their language thedivine office and nearly the whole of the sacred writingsmight very well have come by another way, let us grantthis to have been so, because the traditions of a countrycan effect much, and in matters of history are of greatauthority.Should it have been St. Jerome who translated all this into the common language of the people, wecan perceive the good reason he had for it, and the holymotives which may have urged him to do so.Similarlydoes AEneas Sylvius speak” of the Pope allowing thenatives of Moravia leave to celebrate the divine offices inthe language of the Slavonians some hundreds of yearsbefore. The same permission was granted to the Ruthenians,Armenians, Egyptians, and Ethiopians in their vulgartongues. To the first named this permission was necessary and urgent, because the whole of that kingdom wasconverted to the faith at once; they had no ministers whoknew Latin, and these could not easily be brought fromother places, and it was a lesser inconvenience to permitthem to celebrate in their own language than to deprivethem of the sacraments and the divine offices of theChurch. Thus also did it seem to our saint, and to theintent that the inhabitants of Dalmatia or of Istria, whospoke Slavonic, should not remain without this spirituallight and attainment he did this work.Joan Grap. De Origine.Antwerp, lib. 7.De Origen Bohem. cap. 13.Gotodanica.TRANSLATION OF THE SCRIPTURES INTO SLAVONIC 345Never has there been a nation in the world, whateverits religion might be, or what gods they might profess toworship, but separated their sacred things from thingsprofane, and made some distinction from the common.It has been, so to say, a first principle established in thehearts of those, who have honoured anything as divine,never to make it common or to vulgarise it. The ancientsperceived all this, hence they observed this reserve insacred things, they kept from vilifying and profaning them,and this also does holy Church practise and keep with fargreater reason.DISCOURSE THE SIXTHThe Life led by St. Jerome in Rome.The Exercises heWhat Effects his Words and Examplepractised.produced.HAVING seen in a cursory manner what things St. Jeromehad effected in the universal service of the Church, byemploying his powers and genius to the widening ofher state, things, in truth, of so much worth and weight,the foundation of all that is erected in this beautiful body,it will be as well now to proceed revealing, step by step, thedetails of his life. The details concerning the small thingsof this saint are of no little importance, because, althoughat the time they may have seemed small, their results weregreat, or better said, they became extended and widenedto the universal benefit of the faithful. The lives of holyand learned doctors partake of such grandeur, that whatappears small in them is in truth the seed of great fruits;they are like the stars in the firmament of the Church (asSt. Paul compares them), which, albeit some may seem sosmall to our sight, yet, if any of them were wanting, a gapwould be caused in the ordering of the influence which theySuch also are the arrangements inexercise in the world.this living heaven and firmament of the Church, that fromeven the smallest of these planets of hers so much profitdescends to us, that if any of these, so to say, small things346LIFE IN ROME347be wanting, it would cause great damage in us.Thecourse of life which the holy doctor followed in Rome, aswe have already hinted, was of such a kind that in no onepoint did it differ from the life he lived in the desert; heonly bodily changed the place, the soul was always in thesame condition.Neither the rank of priest of Antioch,to which he had been raised by Paulinus, influenced himto withdraw one hair's-breadth from his strictness of life,nor the great intimacy to which he was admitted byDamasus, nor even the Cardinalate of Rome, caused himto turn away his gaze from the aim of the purpose of hislife. The same hard life and manner of treating his body,the same strict fasts did he pursue.Under his outwardrobes he wore a rough hair-shirt, and his bed and food andother necessaries of common life were like those of Nitriaand Palestine.Only one thing, the occupations of theIn his former life allday, was different, to his sorrow.things were wrapped in God and in the holy Scriptures;here it became inevitable to pour himself out in a greatcrowd of affairs which depended on his office and itsimmediate business.It required of him to leave frequentlyhis retirement. He had to frequent streets and squares.He strove to keep such custody of his eyes that by themcould be seen where those of the soul were placed. Thisholy man was well aware how easily a man goes out ofhimself if he neglects to guard these windows; how difficultit is to withdraw within, and how ready danger is at hand;how common it is that if the soul goes out by them, onits return death has meanwhile entered in by these veryUnder this vigilant care the streets ofsame windows.Rome, crowded as they were with people, were a desertto Jerome. The noise of the crowds and of the marketplace never interrupted his prayer and his meditation,because from the continual abstraction of the senses the348THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEpractice of withdrawing his spirit to the interior hadeffected in his ears the habit of not hearing, nor did hehear anything but what was of importance to the soul.And in truth, if the ears of the evil-minded prove so deafto divine things that, as Isaias says, and St. Paul and eventhe Divine Master Himself declare, that hearing they donot hear, why cannot the ears of the saints do as much PFor all human affairs they are deaf; and truly was Jeromedeaf to the tumult of the world. As to what appertainedto the good of the neighbour, the fulfilment of his duties,attendance on the poor, to favour those in need, to be therefuge of the afflicted—for all these things his senses wereindeed very wide awake.Such was the life of Jerome in Rome, and as such itbecame the admiration of all men. While in proportionas he withdrew his own eyes from men, so did he drawupon himself the eyes of all. Men desired to conversewith him, some, indeed, with the object of leading betterlives, others in order to improve in their studies, andothers again from curiosity, or to find out what was within, orfor no better reason than to follow the stream of the peopleand be thought of some importance, by reason of theircommunicating with a man universally held as a saint andof great learning. There are many of these in the world,who treat with the servants of God and with men of lettersrather for outward ostentation, for neither do they improvein customs, nor in science do they advance a step, satisfiedwith being called “friends of a saint” and of one “whoknows all that is of the very best.” No doubt but thatsuch as these imagine that Heaven, or the House ofWisdom, is like to the banquets of the world where theprincipal guest is at liberty to bring in a friend, and whoenters under his wing.But they are deceived; for unlesshe comes in a wedding garment (I mean the garb ofSPIRITUAL EXERCISES349penitence), and should labour by the sweat of his browday and night, he will not be allowed to cross the thresholdof his door and enter in.

Some followedin order to listen to Him, wishing to behold a brighterlight, and thus be enabled to quit their ignorance, othersto be healed of their maladies; others, again, in order tocalumniate His deeds, full of envy like the Pharisees; andsome, again, for curiosity, to see miracles, listen to discourses, hear and see curious things, and enjoy all marvels.The same occurred to Jerome in Rome, and each ofto histhese types were there, and all who listenedmarvellous doctrines and conversation later on producedtheir respective fruits from the seeds he had sown, asIt was a greathappened to those who followed Christ.labour for our saint to attend to so many differentpersons and business; he felt greatly concerned to findhimself deprived of his sacred exercises. He remediedthis damage with the quickness and promptitude of hisgenius, despatching with resolution and brevity the mostdifficult cases, and by curtailing his sleep at night, and bythe silence and quietude of the hour replacing the lossesof the day; he spent the time in prayer and in the perusal35oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEof holy books, learning there what he was to act afterwards; for such as are in public offices bind themselves tothis, when they venture to undertake them—to watch whilethey sleep over those who are under their care. A greatlabour, indeed, is this were it not responded to by a greatreward.It would be a thing out of all reason to yearn forhonours here, and in the life to come more glory with equalor less labour.This was not taught us by Him whom St.Peter calls Prince of Pastors, nor will it be judged thusby the code which He left signed by His example.

Thesenoble women were, apart from their nobility, worthy ofbeing admitted (despite that at first a persistent war waswaged by the strict monk, until they eventually conquered)by reason of their great sanctity, zeal for virtue, desire ofknowledge, yearning to quit the world to undertake greatthings for Christ, true descendants of those ancient matronswho were so justly celebrated, yet more so than they, for theyeffected greater deeds, since their aims were different andhigher. Among them the most noteworthy were Marcella,SPIRITUAL EXERCISES351Melania, Asella, Albina, Marcelina, and above them all themost saintly matron Paula, widow of Toxotius Patricius,the mother of Blesilla and of the pious virgin Eustochium.We can well declare that in all truth the Church gainedvery considerably by this holy friendship, because theseladies were the occasion for many works and treatisesmade by the great doctor. These holy matrons, by theirimportunate pleadings, awakened in him desires for newlabours; he condescended to their just desires, becausefrom his conversation they became so enkindled with thelove of God, and for the sacred Scriptures that their conversation had no other topic, nor did they cease fromasking him questions and suggesting doubts, seeking fordeclaration, urging him to compose treatises and to writeepistles, and to such an extent that the best which thegreat doctor has left us was done at the petition and prayerof these saintly women. What could there be seeminglyin the Church farther removed from seeking for eruditionand doctrine, variety of languages, expositions of reconditewritings, translations of Hebrew and Greek, than women,and, moreover, Roman women, matrons occupied in thegovernment of their states, the ruling of their homes,domestics, and a thousand other details following uponeach of the above duties. They certainly were not assistedby the knowledge of other discipline, which generallyinduces a thirst for passing on to higher things, nor theemulation of others who ran before or together withthem, nor the object of attaining profit and honours, norhad they other roots or principles such as are needed forentering on labour in so wide a field as the sacred Scriptures would reveal.Despoiled of all these, in order thatit be seen that this was no human affair, God placed intheir souls so vivid a desire for all this, that I feel constrained to say that, were it not for them, Jerome would352THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEnot be the great personage the Church celebrates to-day,at least not so great, for they made him, by their pleadings and with their holy importunities, to open the depthsof his heart, drawing out from thence what he was enjoyingin solitude to the signal loss of the Church. And to thegreat shame of many of the men of those times let it besaid, that they not only did not imitate the diligence andstudy of these women, but they endeavoured to preventthem, and even raised scandal. And in these our timesmen are not less blameworthy, since they exhibit smalldesire and yearning to understand the secrets of thesacred writings, for we do not only take no heed to callforth by our questions and petitions those men to whomGod has communicated these secrets, but we even gnashour teeth with wrath against the lives, occupations, genius,and labours of those who are engaged in doing so, if wesee that they advance or acquire a great name. And whatis above all things most reprehensible is, that we will notturn our attention to the writings of the holy doctors, butwe prefer to peruse the discourses of men truly ignorantof the sacred Scriptures and what they are, and quote theirpamphlets, and waste time, life, and money upon them,forgetful of St. Augustine, St. Ambrose, and of St. Jerome,of whom they knew nothing more than if they had writtenBut let us leave them intheir works in Low Arabic.their ignorance, for we could never disillusion them.Iwill solely give them a sad prophecy, viz., that by pursuing this path they will neither amend their lives nordo any good to their neighbour, nor up to their last daywill they become more learned or wiser than they wereat first.Among other exercises and particular spiritual practicesof the love of God which Jerome held with these matrons,the principal one was to expound in the sacred books, theSPIRITUAL EXERCISES353psalms, and epistles, and other parts.During these discourses it became necessary for him to tell them for theeasier comprehension of the passages, “Thus is it declaredin the Greek text.”“This, again, is as it is stated in theHebrew, and so on.” “This is wanting from the original,and this other is added, or amended, or obscure.” Onaccount of the translation of the Septuagint being whatthey perused, came the desire of these heroic women toknow both the Greek and the Hebrew languages, for itappeared to them that the knowledge of these would beof great advantage for fully comprehending the sacredScriptures. Some of these accordingly took up with greatdiligence the study of both Greek and Hebrew until theycame to know them little less well than their saintlymaster. Among the books which Jerome read to themwith great advantage was the Ecclesiastes of Solomon, ashe states in an epistle' to Paula and Eustochium, herdaughter.The wise doctor had selected with greatprudence this book for their instruction, because the firstthing to be instilled into the minds of persons of socialworth, and position, and influence in the world is to makethem understand of what small value the whole world is,and what small profit it is to us in time of need.This, indeed, is the principal subject and aim of thatbook of Ecclesiastes; it came very apposite to thoseRoman matrons who were of so high a lineage andwealthy, so that convinced by the reasonings of thewise king who had tried all things to satiety, from hisdisillusion they also should learn disillusion, and from hispenitence they likewise should learn their own, and beenabled to strike the balance of the losses and gains ofthis miserable business of earth, of the deceitful cupidity,and low sensuality, which give a result and computation1 Epist. 116.2 A354THE LIFE OF ST.

What recompense does a man derive from this? What remains, orwhat accrues to him ?Nothing remains to him; he findsnothing within, because on reaching the end of life he findshimself despoiled of them all, and these very things havebeen the actual causes of his course of life coming soquickly to an end. These great truths are all summed upin a vanity of infinite vanities, no receipts and a greatoutlay.This was the opening lesson which St. Jeromeread to his saintly pupils, in order, in the first place, toopen their eyes, and by means of a vivid persuasion drawout of their hearts the deep-set roots of the glory of thisworld, because until this be effected in the spiritual lifethere is nothing done, although they should have labouredfor a thousand years. The effect of all this soon becamevisible in Blesilla and the great fruit of the holy lesson,because her disillusion and her life ended simultaneously.Blesilla was very beautiful and wealthy, had just beenmarried, and was in her twentieth year; nevertheless shewas never absent from the lesson, and when ended, besought the master to write down his instruction in orderthat during his absence she should have the lesson alwaysbefore her eyes. Yet before this was effected our Lordread it to her by the experience of trials. He took firsther husband from her, after only seven months of weddedCONVERSION OF BLESILLA355This loss was followed by obstinate fevers whichlife.brought her down to the point of death; she was enwrapped in the fire of this fever, and as in a cruciblethe fine gold of her soul was purified. Then during thatcrisis, comparing her own experience with the lesson givenin Ecclesiastes, she beheld all things in the light of thewise man, and on rising from her sick bed she totallyaltered her life; she changed her apparel and turned thestateliness of her house and its arrangements from asuperb palace into an humble monastery. She embracedthe Cross of Christ, treading under foot all the glory ofthe world, and went forth to lead the life of a nun; she socourageously entered the state of penance that her newspouse Christ, satisfied with her love and the sorrow Heperceived in her for not having always been His, that Hewas minded to take her to enjoy His kingdom.Two letters did the saintly doctor write in divineI feel I would be doingstrains in regard to this episode.wrong were I not to introduce here some portions ofthem, for two reasons—first, in order to verify what hasbeen said, lest some might think that I have imagined allthis, the conversation and communion between Jeromeand these saintly women; and secondly, to reveal hisAnd that we should blush to seesanctity and theirs.ourselves fit for so little and so womanish, being men, andthey being women, yet with such heroic masculine powers.Writing to Marcella about the fever of Blesilla, and ofthe change in her manner of life, St. Jerome says asfollows:—“Abraham was tempted in his son, and wasJoseph was sold in Egypt, so that in goodfound faithful.time he should maintain his father and his brethren.Ezechiel was terrified at his approaching death, and weptbitter tears, and a further term of life was given of fifteenPeter the Apostle was overcome in the Passion ofyears.356THE LIFE OF ST.

What could there be morerough than locusts?”To this the saint adds some passages against thefashions of the day, the postures and the finery whichwas in use at that time, not only among ladies andmaidens, but among the widows, who, as St. Paul expresses it, did not merit the title of widows; and he thenadds: “This one widow used formerly to spend muchtime in beautifying herself.Her days were spent indemanding of her mirror whether anything was amiss orwanting: now with holy confidence she says—All of usunveiled and with a clear sight view ourselves in theBeforemirror of the faith and of the glory of the Lord.this looking-glass we shall arrange and dress ourselvesconformably with His image and likeness, passing fromone degree of light into another like to the Spirit of theFormerly her maids were daily occupied for longLord.”hours in combing her hair, braiding, curling, and makingcrowns or high designs with it; but now, despised anddisarranged, she is satisfied if her head be but covered.In other days the very feathers of her bed seemed hard toher, and her elegantly-furnished drawing-room she couldscarce abide; but now she is the first to rise to prayer,she intones the Alleluia before any one else in a sweet358THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEand tender voice, and is the first to commence the divinepraises. She bends her bare knees on the bare ground,and by continual tears she bathes that countenance whichformerly she spoiled with cosmetics!” Many other passagesof this kind does he proceed recounting, to depict to usthe change in Blesilla.These, however, suffice to manifest the powerful influence which the doctrines of thesaint had exerted, the fruits of his lessons, the profit ofhis instructions, and the effects of his conversation in theminds of people so daintily brought up, and so patrician,surrounded by all that was most precious and esteemed byRoman luxury; how powerful his words and example hadbeen.In those days that city was at the height of itsluxury; its senators and matrons were most wealthy; theypossessed large estates and wide lands; they were muchgiven up to comforts and the delights of life; and, aswe have said, these matrons and maidens were of thechiefest and highest of the aristocracy.Over all thesedid Jerome triumph with his doctrines, and by his discourses prevailed upon them to fling all the pleasures andjoys of the world to the ground.As regards the exercises of the sacred Scriptures, wecan gather from the words he addressed to the mother ofBlesilla, St. Paula, what these exercises were, in anepistle wherein he tries to console her for her daughter'sdeath: “Who can with tearless eyes call to mind a piouswoman of only twenty who with such burning faith raisedthe Standard of the Cross? One would say she did notweep for her dead husband but for her maidenhood. Whocan recall without emotion the force of her reasoning, thepurity of her speech, the tenacity of her memory, and theacuteness of her genius’If you heard her speak Greek,you would declare that there could not have remainedEpist. 25.CONVERSION OF BLESILLA359time for her to learn Latin.If she reverted to the mothertongue of Rome, there was no accent of a foreign tonguein her speech.What is a greater marvel (similarly toOrigen, for which he became so widely admired in Greece),in a few days—I do not mean months, but days—she overcame in such a way the difficulties of the Hebrew tongue,that in the recital and singing of the Psalms she competedwith her mother.Blesilla had become so worn and weakand ill that she could hardly walk without assistance;nevertheless, in her hands were ever the prophets or thegospels, her eyes ever streaming with tears.Sobs prevented her words, yet her tender heart did not allow herparched tongue to rest. When her saintly form was inburning fever, and her rough bed surrounded by herrelatives, these were her last words: Beseech the LordJesus Christ to pardon me, because I was unable to fulfil whatI had desired to do. You are safe, Blesilla; I am confidentthat from thence you approve the truth which here we arestating.”From all this is clearly seen how brilliantly the exercises of letters and virtues were followed, and what workthe words and example of this father was effecting; howfervently must his words have come forth from his heart,what stability they carried with them since they effectedsuch havoc among the worldly luxury of the most culturedpeople of the world.I feel I cannot keep silence, nor is itjust that a further paragraph of this letter should be omitted,because it is of great importance, not alone as a confirmation of what has been said, but for the comfort and reliefof souls afflicted by the loss of children, and other trials.Thus does he speak of Paula: “I cannot utter what Iwish to say without sighing. When in the midst of thefuneral ceremonies you swooned away and were takenhome almost without life in you, the people murmured,36oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEand from between their teeth they hissed out these words:Is it not what we have so often said 2It is dreadful forher to witness the death of her daughter from sheer fasting,and would to God, that if not from her first marriage, atleast from her second nuptials she should have left her agrandchild.Until when is this hapless class of monks tobe permitted?

How greatly would Satan'sdelight be now that he is trying to gain your soul bysetting before your eyes the causes for a just grief, whilehe places before you the image of your dead triumphantdaughter, to assume to overcome the mother, and when hefinds her alone to encounter the sister.”Then farther on he says: “How many torments doyou deem you are causing our Blesilla, on seeing thatMethinks I hear her, andChrist is thus treated by you?that from thence she is crying out to you: ‘O mother, ifat any time you felt love for me; if I suckled at yourbreast; if from you I learned holy warnings, I pray you donot envy my glory, do not act in such a way that for everwe should remain apart.

A great consolation is this to thosewho are journeying with some degree of earnestness, andwho endeavour to take others on with them.There isnothing which renders the enemy of souls more furiousthan this.His aim has always been to discredit virtue, tomake her the subject of suspicion, to prognosticate evils ofher, so that even such as are circumspect should be scandalised. He would wish to persuade the world that what is to362THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe purpose is to follow a smooth path, and what the disciplesof his school call a plain way is to eat and drink, to laugh,play, and even swear; never to withdraw oneself for amoment to think of the wretchedness of one's past life, toform purposes of amendment for what remains of it, andnever ponder over what they owe to God, nor upon whatHe has done for them, all this being dangerous andsuspicious.Fasting they call hypocrisy; hair-shirts, folly;silence, bestiality; retirement, dangerous; in a word, allthat is outside their rules, and hints at the contempt of theworld, and of penance, is an invention or insanity; whileall that corresponds to the wide road which Christ hasdeclared leads to perdition is a plain life, and so smooththat men proceed from vice to vice, from sin to sin,ascending from one to the other, as they say, by a steadyroad to hell.What they said of St. Jerome, that very same do theysay now, because the enemy which we always carryon our shoulders is ever the same, and the one whichfavours him outside and urges him on, is one who isnever weary.DISCOURSE THE SEVENTHContinuation of the Life and Labours of St. Jerome inInformation is afforded respecting some WorksRome.he composed.FROM the foregone discourses glimpses of the life whichour glorious father led have been revealed, the works andthe labours he pursued, and brought to bear in saintlysouls, who were so well disposed for receiving the seed ofhighest doctrine from his lips, as was quickly perceived bythe great fruits which they produced in the change oflife, and in some by a blessed death.I feel confident thatJerome was the occasion of the signal change effected inthe noble Matron, Melania, who was one of the wealthiestShe left all things andand noblest ladies in Rome.departed to Jerusalem to lead a conventual life.Previousto the coming of the holy doctor to Rome, this custom ofmatrons becoming nuns, or of going to holy lands,Jerusalem, or Bethlehem, had never been heard of orcomprehended; but after his arrival nought was heardbut these things. So greatly can good communicationsThis great man by his eloquenceinfluencepeople.power, by his words and actionswielded a greatharmonising with each other.In the epistle which hasbeen under discussion, among other reasons which heEpist. xxv. cap. 3.363364THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEgives Paula for restraining her grief for her lost daughteris the example of Melania.“I do not wish,” he says, “torepeat old fables.I wish to consider present things.The holy Matron, Melania, truly noble among theChristians of our times, while yet her husband hadscarcely been laid in his grave, lost two of her children.I am going to state a thing which seems almost impossibleto believe, but Christ is witness of the truth. Who would nothave thought that then this woman would have given wayto a terrible fit of grief, or perhaps even attempted herown life? Yet she never shed a tear; she remained thereimmovable, then she went and cast herself at the feet ofChrist crucified, and embracing them, with a smile onher countenance, said: “A-ord, now indeed V will serve Theewith a fuller heart and with greater freedom, since Thouhast been pleased to deliver me from so great a charge.”And leaving her possessions, goods, and wealth to herlast child, and at the commencement of the winter, shetook ship to Jerusalem. We might say of St. Jerome inthose times what the Pope Urban said of St. Cecilia:“Lord, Thy servant Jerome, like a wise, solicituous bee,serves Thee, bringing to the hive of Thy holy land theflowers of the gardens of Rome.” He performed manyother services for the Church whilst still dwelling in thiscity. Through the pleadings of Fabiola he wrote the twocelebrated treatises, “on the forty-two mansions,” whichthe children of Israel made, from the time they passed theRed Sea, coming out of Egypt, until they reached theshores of the Jordan, and entered into the promised land.He expounded these in the spiritual sense, comparingthe text and showing them to be an express figure ofthe road we ourselves journey in this captivity of theworld and of sin, to the life and promised liberty, afterpassing the sea of the red baptism in the blood of Christ,TREATISES AND EPISTLES365wherein our enemies are left drowned, and we are deliveredon the shore.This one work alone of St. Jerome wouldhave sufficed to render him immortal and well worthy ofthe title of “Doctor of the Church.”The other treatise was an epistle, wherein he declaresthe secret meanings of the vesture and ornaments of theAt the commencement hehigh priest in the old law.reveals the sacraments and mysteries of many of thosesacrifices, ceremonies, laws, and rites; then he comes tothe purpose, drawing much light of doctrine from thoseearly shadows for succeeding ages.Here he also wrotethat renowned epistle to the Virgin Eustochium on the“Guarding of Virginity,” since she was the one whoamong the daughters of Paula had taken the vow ofvirginity, and became the constant companion of the lifeand pilgrimages of her saintly mother.This epistle wasvery much discussed and even murmured at. Jerome in itreprehends all the corrupted portions of the Church andthe classes of vices which may enter into the lives ofpersons bearing the title of “Servants of Jesus Christ,”persons living in retirement, professors of sanctity on thetheiroutside, the life led within being very different,Thisconsciences being very wide and unwholesome.epistleoffended the clergy, the monks, the affectedlypious women, widows, and maidens, to whom all thesetitles were inappropriate.I mean such as those whodwelt in Rome; and quickly this resentment extendedthroughout Italy and France, as may be seen from thedefence made of it by Sulpicius Severus.”Without doubt St. Jerome in this work reveals andbrings forward the secret sores, and he who is touchedwith the evil, on finding that his wounds are being1 Epist. cxxviii.Severus Sulpicius, dialog, primo, De virtutibus monachor.

JEROMESt.approached, cannot dissemble the pain and cries out.Jerome will not endure hypocrisy; he deeply feels thehonour of Christ and of His Church; he reckons it a greatwickedness to bear the name of priest and of monk, andyet in the interior to be what cannot be mentioned withoutthe blush of shame.In all his letters and treatises it isremarkable how constantly and generally he enjoins readingand prayer.It is impossible without these two that thesoul should grow in virtues, any more than that the crops ofthe fields should thrive without rain, and in the gardens theAbout thatflowers should grow without watering them.time he also wrote other epistles and treatises. To Marcellahe sent, among others, a very important epistle, in which hegives the ten divine names more frequently found in theHebrew lessons; another one on such words intheHebrew and the Greek as remained untranslated, such asAbout thisAllelu-ia, Amen, Maranatha,time there arose a disciple of the famous Arian Auxentius,called Elvidius or Helvidius, a man as bold as he wasignorant.

He wrote a book andpublished it, and despite that he was a man of no eruditionor doctrine he found men to read and give credit to it.From this there grew a sect, or followers, who were calledHelvidians and Antidicomarianites, I mean to say, sectariesAnd, forasand heretics, against the virginity of Mary.much as many pious men saw with dismay that thisshameful error would cause havoc among the weak, theyall turned to Jerome, as though they sought to indicatethat to him appertained the defence of the case. Andthey judged rightly, because, if in all the discourses andcolloquies he ever had Bethlehem on his lips, the crib, andthe holy land, the cave where the holiest virgin wasDiapsalma.TREATISES AND EPISTLES367delivered, and wherein was laid on the straw the Breadwhich satisfies the world, and was ever treating upon theseloved things, his desires being ever to implant them in thehearts of each one, it was just that he should not permit asingle spot to blemish the fair name of a maid so pure. Asmen perceived that Jerome was silent, they decided to callThey besought him with much feeling tohim forth.reply to the effrontery of this heretic. And he did so.The saint took up his pen, and with wisdom and eruditionquite his own, he wrote the book De perpetua virginitate,which is found among his works, against Helvidius, and theerror was destroyed at once.At the beginning of thebook St. Jerome excuses himself for his delay and silence,saying that, if he had hesitated answering the book ofHelvidius, it was not on account of any difficulty of thematter, but because by replying, in defence of a truth sowell established and manifest, to a rude man (who scarcelyknew grammar), it would be to do him too great anhonour, but he would be very well pleased to answer him,Jerome wrote this when inin order to conquer him.Rome, as he himself says in the epistle to the Galatians.“I remember,” he says, “that being in Rome, moved bythe pleadings of many brethren, I wrote a book on theperpetual virginity of the holy mother of the Lord.”Inthis book, not only did he convince the heretic as regardsthe chief intention of the blessed virgin, but he evenmanifests it to be certain that her holy spouse, St. Joseph,was also a virgin."At the petition of the holy Pontiff, Damasus, Jeromeperformed many other useful things in Rome on behalf ofthe Church. He expounded and declared” what themeaning was of that oft-repeated word Hostagna, or, asthough corrupting the word, we say Osanna or Hosanna.Lib. De perpet. virgin. cap. ix.Epist. cxlv.368THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEAnd availing himself of this occasion, while seeking theroot from the Hebrew source, as he says, he expoundsnearly the whole of Psalm cxvii., whence the verse istaken which the evangelists quote. He also expounded tohim the parable of the prodigal son' and waster, and ofthe thrifty and diligent man, in the spiritual sense.Atthe petition of the same Pontiff, he made the translationof the Homilies of Origen on the Canticles, and forasmuchas the prologue of that work was the occasion of thedissensions which arose between him and Rufinus, andindividual drew the motive for hisfrom these thisintemperate anger, it will be as well that we should heresay something on this affair, and understand his smallreason, or great malice for doing so.He says as follows: “Although Origen in some workstriumphed over others, yet in this one on the Canticles hesurpassed himself, for after having written ten volumes,which contain nearly 20,000 verses, he expounds firstthe Septuagint, then Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotian, and, furthermore, in the fifth edition (which itis said was found on the shores of Actium), with suchexcellency and clearness that it appears he verified inhimself what is said, ‘The king hath brought me into hisBut putting aside, however, that work whichstoreroom.”demands infinite space, great labour, and expenditure, totranslate so many things into Latin, these two othertreatises, which he composed for the little ones, who haveneed of milk, in simple diction, I have wished to translate,preserving rather fidelity than ornate writing, offering youin them not the height of the meaning, but something towin for you a taste for them.From this you may judgeof what esteem those large ones be, since these that aresmall contain so much."1 Epist. cxlvi.Canticles, 1, 3.TREATISES AND EPISTLES369From these just and due praises of Origen occasion wastaken by Rufinus to declare our saint to be an Origenist.And as to him it appeared that Origenist and heretic werenot far from being synonyms, he had no patience to becalled such.From this arose a storm.St. Jerome also wrote in Rome an exposition of theHebrew alphabet to Paula Urbica, to which I have alreadydrawn attention, and, as I also said, he follows in thisEusebius of Caesarea.It was singular this desire of women,who asked the saintly doctor about things which I marvelthey had information of and taste for.I do not thinkthat ever before or after has been witnessed in theChurch up to the present time so novel a case of somany matrons being gathered together, so saintly andso tender, desirous of understanding the sacred writingsand the secrets contained in them.Yet at this juncture methinks that some maliciousspirit secretly judged proper to cast aspersions for thisreason on the saintly man by saying that many were thetreatises and epistles and commentaries which he wrotefor women, and few, comparatively, that he addresses to,and writes for men.That lofty things of such gravityand recondite, as are the mysteries of the holy Scriptures,should not be communicated to them. That it implied toomuch familiarity and is worthy of remark, that he shouldteach Greek and Hebrew to them, a thing we have noproof he did, but to only a few men, and that it seemsimpossible there should be so few wishing to be taughtand to learn them, and that he was better pleased to teachwomen. These charges are not new, nor to murmur ateither, because malice is very old, and the same is bothinherited and acquired.this waswhispered into the ears of the saint.In those days allSt. Jerome felt the necessity of affording some satisfac2 B37oTHE LIFE OF ST.

And they receivedthe reply in an epistle which he addressed to the virginPrincipia when sending to her the exposition of Psalmxliv, And whereas he replied for himself, we ourselvesLet us hear his own answer,are relieved of that duty.and receive our own share of his shafts.In the commencement of his Epistle" he says as follows: “I amwell aware, Principia, my daughter in the Lord, that I amgreatly reprehended because I address women, and that Iprefer the weaker sex to men, taking more notice ofI have need, in the first place,the women than of men.to answer those who murmur against me, then I willproceed to treat upon what you ask me.Did men occupythemselves with the sacred Scriptures and demand asmany questions as women do, I would not speak withwomen.If Barak” had willed to go to battle, Deborahwould not have triumphed over the conquered enemies.They enclose Jeremias in a prison, and because thecondemned town would not receive the man, who hadcome to prophesy to them, God sent them the woman,Holda.” The priests and the Pharisees crucified the Sonof God, and Mary Magdalen was the one who wept bythe Cross, who prepared the ointments, who sought Himat the sepulchre, asking of the gardener and recognisingin Him her Lord.It is she who runs with the news tothe Apostles; tells them that He is risen: if they doubt,she herself has perfect confidence.”In this way he continues proving and confirming hiswords by a number of other passages in Scripture, withincisive allusions and examples, and concludes his reasonings by saying: “Christ speaks to the Samaritan womanat the well, better satisfied in His thirst for souls with thethe food which thefaith of the believer thanwithEpist. 140.Judges iv.Hierome 36, 4 Reg. 22.TREATISES AND EPISTLES371disciples had purchased for Him.Apollo, an apostolicman and most learned in the law, ‘one mighty in theScriptures, is taught by Aquila and Priscilla, and theyHence, if it beexpound to him the ways of the Lord.not an ancient thing, nor undue in an apostle to allowhimself to be taught by women, why should it not bepermissible in me, after having taught many men, to teachwomen also P”The same strain does he follow in the prologue toSophonias, and says: “Before I comment on Sophonias,who is the ninth among the twelve prophets, it becomesimperative for me to reply to those who judge me worthyof scorn, because, putting aside the men, I write towomen, and to you especially, O Paula and Eustochium !And did they but know that, when men kept silent, Holdaand Deborah, both judge and prophetess, prophesied andovercame the enemies of Israel when Barak was cowardly;that Judith and Esther, as figures of the Church, cut theheads off their enemies, and delivered Israel from peril,I speak not ofthey would not lash thus my back.Anna, Elizabeth, and other holy women, who are cast intothe shade by the greater resplendency of Mary, as thestars pale before the greater light of the sun.Let usapproach the Gentile women, in order that in the ageof philosophers they should learn that difference of bodyis not what is sought for, but of soul.

JEROMEWhy speak ofspecial case with only one matron.Portia, daughter of Cato, wife of Brutus, whose courage isa good reason that we should not be astonished at that ofher father and husband? Greek and Roman history isfull of all this, and even whole books.It suffices to meto say at the end of this prologue (since I wish to cometo the work of expounding) that at the resurrection of ourLord He first appeared to the women, thus making themapostles of His apostles, in order that men should behumbled and ashamed of not seeking for what the womenhad already found.With these last words does our saint draw attention tothe indifference and negligence of the men of his day,and well does he make known his desire of communicatingthese mysteries to his fellowmen, who might therebyteach other men in their turn; but there were none topartake of that desire, and, what is more astonishing, is tosee that no one seemed inclined to learn Hebrew orGreek or, as regards the study of the sacred Scriptures, to bea disciple, but only these saintly women, who delighted inknowing them, and for that object took trouble to learn theselanguages, and I believe that the saint himself felt greatpleasure in this study, as he praises such as took thistrouble, not only for the great fruit which he drew fromit, on account of the great secrets which were revealed,but he even enjoyed the construction and beauty of thelanguages.During the time that Jerome remained in Rome,which, as we shall see farther on, did not exceed threeyears, he sent for his brother Paulinian, who was veryyoung, having been born at the time Jerome was inSyria. We know not if he sent for him on account ofthe death of his parents. The saint does not say it,although it is believed it was for that reason. On theTUITION OF PAULINIAN373arrival of the lad, he undertook his education.Jeromewas to him brother, father, tutor, and master. He taughthim grammar and Latin, I believe Greek also, the onebeing of use in learning the other, and our great doctor wellknew how it ought to be taught.Paulinian soon manifested good qualities and talents, while the boon of havingso good a master quickly developed his mind, as we shallsee farther on, because, while still a very young man,St. Epiphanius ordained him priest on account of hisThis dignity of priest was heldvirtues and letters.in higher esteem then than at present, and demandedgreater merits. Of this we shall treat more extensivelyin its proper place.DISCOURSE THE EIGH THSt. Jerome is persecuted in Rome.False Testimonies raisedagainst him.Quits Rome for the Holy Land.IT is quite the usual thing in the world for saintly mento be persecuted.It has been, as it were, agreedbetween God and His servants on one part, and the deviland his own on the other part, that the latter shouldpersecute the former; that the good should suffer andbe tortured, that the wicked should exercise upon themtheir malice, and that as long as they live in the worldthese should triumph, the others weep, and that after aLet the wicked nowshort time all things be reversed.raise up false testimonies, crushing them with affronts;let them be cast into prisons, exiled, covered with miseriesas by a mantle; let them be loaded with all the misfortunesthat can be devised, until they end this life by a sad death;all, all will be in the end the fulfilment of the arrangement assented to very long ago between the ancientserpent and man: “She shalt crush thy head, and thou shaltlie in wait for her heel.” There is no need to fill pageswith examples.It suffices for my purpose to say that noone can meditate on the life of any saintly man withoutdiscovering something of this, and in many of them a greatdeal; indeed this fact has come to be so widely acknow1 Genesis iii. 15.374PERSECUTION IN ROME375ledged that we ourselves do not hold a saint to be so whodoes not pass through all this.I will only refer to whatthe Catholic Queen, Doña Isabel (of whose memory Spainrejoices), that when she witnessed the persecutions andfalsetestimonies which were raised against the holyArchbishop of Granada, Fray Hernando de Talavera, ofthe Order of St. Jerome, the first archbishop nominated byher, she exclaimed: “This indeed is what was wanting tomy father for him to be a saint /"The Queen indeed had always held him to be a saint,yet she had not seen him under trials; she had judged hissanctity to be solid, and when she saw him tried she wasconfirmed and certified in her judgment.And in order that this should not be wanting toJerome, and so that he should go through all this andeven have something left to give others for their instruction, it will be well to understand that the enemy wouldnot treat Jerome more gently in Rome than he had doneformerly in the desert. And as he himself expresses it,whithersoever he might go, and wherever he was placed,whether he changed places or not, he could not change hisadversary.In return for the great labours he had gonethrough to adorn that city and serve the Church, hecould only expect and receive what men usually give.How could the devil rest or mitigate his fury, whenJerome was waging against him such a warfare? Manywere there of the devil's band, who had become convertedto a better life and joined the army of Christ on hisaccount—some from the errors of idolatry to the faith;others from a slumbering faith and evil ways to a livingfaith and to good morals, due to Jerome's discourses,counsels, admonitions, doctrine, and example, by whichthey came to hate vice, to love sanctity, and thus quittheir blindness, put aside their pleasures, lead retired376THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMElives, penitential, monastic, and so forth, even such aswere more delicately brought up. The adversary ragedin his fury; and he would not be what he is, did he notstrive to take revenge for so much damage and make up forso many losses; because one of two things was imperative—either Jerome and a great portion of the virtues and theadvantages linked to souls should quit the city, or he (theevil one), with his great crowd of numberless and namelessvices, leave Rome, because Jerome, and the devil and hisvices, despite the size of the city, could not remain thereSuch was the speed and the fervour with whichtogether.the saint pursued and reprehended vice, that it becamewell-nigh insupportable.The whole city in heart was divided on this case.For,although outwardly the opposing parties did not dare toopen their mouths, and agreed together in secret, both thoseagainst and in favour of him agreed in saying that God hadbrought that man for the remedy of the city, and that afterthe days of Pope Damasus it was a recognised andestablished opinion that he would be called to occupy theNevertheless, within their hearts theychair of Peter.were very much separated.Such as had never earnestlysought to amend their lives, but were given up to theirvices, were very much on the side of the devil, and theyfelt Jerome's influence as much as he did.They chafed and were hurt by the reprehensions of thesaint, known and pointed at as wretched Christians, heldin naught and almost denied speech by the good, whofollowed the mandate—that with such as these not to breakbread with them. Among these marked ones were somebad priests, whose conversation and life the saint had welldepicted in his epistle on Virginity, and whom he hadreprehended in public with vivid words.These, togetherwith the arch enemy, gave the warning note, and theyPERSECUTION IN ROME377commenced business; at first and little by little theybegan to circulate with veiled words, uttered as though asa secret, a slight rumour, as bewailing and lamenting thefair fame of the holy man, in order to see how it wouldbe received and believed: “What a pity should therebe any truth in what is said in secret !”“There arereports that this man's life is not altogether what it shouldbe. We are grieved to the soul that it should be so!”Furthermore, it was hinted that his wickedness was suchthat Jerome was persuading Paula and other matrons, whobelonged to the highest nobility of the city, to go and livefar away in the Holy Land, because by so doing he wouldbecome owner and master of their wealth and theirIn this way did they seek to defame the holyproperty.man in secret, and indeed not so very secretly; thus didthey tear his life up in their fury.At this juncture Pope Damasus died. God permittedthat by this event His saint should be deprived of patronand protector, and alone, to face these hard trials.By thedeath of Damasus the enemies of Jerome remained mastersof the field, with many paths open for their designs, becausehis presence alone prevented them from daring to breakout in public against Jerome, both on account of the greatfriendship which existed between the pontiff and Jerome,who were like one soul, and because the holy pontiff hadsuffered similar affronts, and had had infamies laid at hischarge by two wicked deacons, Concordius and Callistus.Without a shadow of doubt, Damasus, had he lived, wouldhave taken up the case as his own, and this they hadfeared lest in them would be executed the law—not sostrict as just—which had been passed in his own cause,that he who should falsely accuse another would be liableto the same penalty as the accused would have had toMeanwhile, as long assuffer had his guilt been proved.378THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEDamasus lived, there had been only circulated someinquiries, some secret hints.Damasus died, after governing and occupying theapostolic chair nineteen years with great sanctity, powerfulexample, much peace, after leaving arranged most holythings, to the augmentation of the divine worship, andwithout doubt he was one of the greatest saints andpontiffs who have occupied the Holy See.His death isfixed as having taken place in 384.Jerome at the timemust have been in the forty-fourth year of his age,This was theaccording to the most reliable accounts.same year that St. Augustine entered Milan to teachrhetoric, he being then thirty years old, as appears fromwhat he himself says in his Confessions, cap. xiii.The next pontiff elected was Siricius, who at first wascalled Ursicinus or Ursinus—I believe he was first electedI have a suspicionin competition with Pope Damasus.that, whereas this pontiff was a simple man and easygoing, occasion was taken by the rivals of the saintto publicly exhibit their malice.Although St. Jeromewas with the Pope some days in Rome, I do not find thathe mentions him in any noteworthy manner.Twice doeshe mention Siricius in the third part of the ApologiaEpistle on the epitaph ofagainstMarcella” he applies to him the term of simple man. Hegives us to understand that Rufinus took advantage of hissimplicity to introduce the errors of Origen into Rome,deceiving many of the clergy and laymen, and that he alsodeceived or scorned the simplicity of the bishop, this beingunderstood of Siricius.Farther on he says that he wassucceeded by Athanasius after a few years. At this timewicked men began to make public the malicious thingswhich had been circulated in secret, and they advancedRufinus.In theEpist. 16, c. 41.PERSECUTION IN ROME379wickedly against the sanctity of Jerome and Paula inventions such as might be expected from their evil hearts.They found a common man, who, for a small bribe andinterest, brought forward accusations against them. Theaffair reached to such a pitch that, as it concerned personsof such high position and importance, this man wasarrested. He was put to the torture to speak the truth,and as malice could not long be hidden away, he declaredthat all he had said and circulated in corners and conventicles was false and evil, and not a word of truth hadhe spoken. That they were both saintly persons, and hehimself held them as saints.But Jerome, on witnessing the great malice that hadurged these men on, the spirit of his enemies so badlydisposed in his regard, and feeling that such as had spreadthese falsehoods would still continue in their evil course,nor would they cease to persecute him, after matureconsideration resolved upon quitting Rome.God alsowilled to draw His servant out of the tumult and bustle ofthe world, and that, whereas he had served Him in thegeneral and public things of His Church, he in likemanner should serve Him in other more especial ones,ever performing the office of doctor, and by these meansto bring many others into His service. The holy doctorpondered in his mind on the quietude and solitude, andhis yearning for the Holy Land, and the longings to dwellin the holy places were renewed in his heart.Let us hear from him the narrative of the case and themalice hatched against him, which he depicts in vividcolouring in the Epistle which on board ship he wroteto Asella, before the anchor was raised and the sails unfurled.“Jerome to Asella, health.Did I wish to return youEpist. 99.38oTHE LIFE OF ST.

The Lord saw them andlaughed at them; and as to me, a poor servant of His, Heguarded me, in order to decide my cause with them injudgment.Some would find fault with my manner ofwalking and my laughter; others criticised my diffidenceand demeanour, and others again murmured at my sincerityand plain dealing, and formed imaginations and suspicions.For nearly three years did I dwell with them, and manycame to converse and communicate with me; to many ofthese I declared the divine books as best I could.Letthem speak up now; let them say whether they ever sawin me anything which was not allowable, or not in harmonyDid I ever receive money?with the life of a Christian?PERSECUTION IN ROME381Whatsoever presents and gifts were offered me, whetherlarge or small, did I not refuse them?

Thusdo even come true the words of the wise man : “Aman is known by his look, and a wise man, when thoumeetest him, is known by his countenance.The attire ofthe body, and the laughter of the teeth, and the gait of theBecause, in the same way as theman, show what he is.”Ecclus. xix.382THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEdiseases are seen by outward means, which doctors callsymptoms, and by which they are able to judge the heightor kind of fever, and the gravity of the evil suffered, so alsothe virtue or the sickness of the soul appear in the eyes,the countenance, and face by certain signs, as being theregistry or the channels through which anguish and desiresare poured out. This philosophy is taught us by St. Augustine, where he says that the eyes which are not pure arethe messengers of the unchaste soul. And St. GregoryNazianzen in his invectives against Julian the Apostate,says that from the signs of his looks, his walk, and attire,he at once perceived the great wickedness which that wildbeast concealed within.And it is in reason that themodesty of demeanour and behaviour of our great Jeromeshould always be represented to our eyes, and that weshould not cease, as his sons, to imitate him, lest throughour own fault and negligence we should make void theSpanish proverb or saying, applied to any one who beingcalm, recollected, and modest in his walk and demeanour,“he walks like a Jerome.”There is one thing, among a hundred others in thisEpistle, worthy of deep consideration for those who findthemselves attacked by false testimonies and affronts, thatthe devil endeavours with all his powers then to inducethem to depart from following the paths commenced, andto this purpose he directs all his wiles, more especiallywhen it be a good work which is being carried out andlikely to increase; and for the same reason a great resistance and firmness is required. This is very well taught usThere was perceived an admirable constancyin this letter.in St. Jerome, a grand heart raised loftily above all thoseschemes, and master of them; and there is also anotherthing to be learned by it—not to make much of any presenttrouble, but to set the eye and the aim on what is eternal,PERSECUTION IN ROME383and where there exists another tribunal set in justice,where, without respect of persons or deceit of any kind,causes are examined, and where neither favour avails, norpower, nor even malice, but only rectitude and cleannessof heart, and the good works which may accompany theIt is also worthy of being kept in mind, since it issoul.the sole consolation of the good, that oftentimes themurmurs of the bad and the evil eye, directed againstthem, spring from the fact that, as they perceive thatothers are praised and esteemed by reason of their virtues,while they themselves, on account of their wretched livesand intercourse, are detested and held in disesteem, no confidence placed in their person in any one thing, they take asa means (when they dare not rise up to where the good are)to try and bring them down to their own level, either byspeaking ill of their lives, defaming them, scorning theirways, raising up against them false testimonies, and by dissuading them—when they can do no more—from followingThis they do, because it would bethe path of rectitude.a great solace to their rage and envy that there shouldexist no good persons, nor any one signal in virtue, whoshould react as a note and correction on their own lives, butthat all should pursue the one road they follow, lost andundone; thus they would not be known, nor the othersAgainst all this, he, whojudged superior to themselves.would assume to be a servant of God, must oppose a boldfront, with the heart of a Jerome, and laugh at them,saying: “Brother, walk wherever you may wish, andIf you hold him to be a fool or hapless,leave me alone!who journeys along the road of roughness, and the narrowpath, which leads to life, and who strives to enter in by thestill narrower gate, which is that of penance, I hold you to befar more miserable and bereft of judgment who walk alongthe wide highway, which you call level, by which many384THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEIf you hold me to be a fool becausejourney on to death.I do violence to my flesh and to my senses, and deprivemyself of what this body of sin craves, and the law ofsensuality, I on my part judge you deficient of sense, inthat you do not hear the voice of the Saviour, who saysthat from the days of St. John the Baptist (that is to say,since the preaching of penance) the kingdom of heavensuffereth violence and is conquered, and that it is theviolent who carry it away.”In a word, from this letter is clearly gathered the condition and conversation of the world, and the nature of thesame. Who that saw St. Jerome, when he entered intoRome, received with so much applause, and who was sogreatly desired, of such high repute as we have shown,who worked things of such great utility in the Churchthings which none other ever had done, and within theshort space of three years, during which he laboured soindefatigably in the city, did such incredible work, nowsees him as he is about to leave that cityAffronted, dishonoured, persecuted, scorned, he must needs consider hishonour and write the letter he did.Oh, great Doctorof the Church !It was well that this should happen thus.You used oftentimes to say: “The disciple is not greaterAnd whereas you take glory inthan the Master /being servant of Jesus Christ, bear in mind with whatglory and applause He was received in Jerusalem shortlybefore the Passover, and in what a manner he came forthout of Jerusalem.”And well does the saint manifest to us that the abovethought was not far from the mind, since he himself saysthat he returns infinite thanks to His Divine Majesty formaking him worthy of the world's hatred. And the readerwho will continue considering the course of the life of thisgreat doctor, will find that he is great in everything, inPERSECUTION IN ROME385being persecuted, murmured at, and calumniated; mostgreat, because the devil took up as an undertaking to casthim down, and to oppose him and to make war on him,because the saint was himself waging a fierce war on him.We have already seen what passed in the desert: how hesuffered grievous sickness in the body, terrible and continued temptations in the soul; on one side the heretics,and so that there should be no part of him without beingfatigued, in return for the benefits he worked in Rome heis dismissed, and he bids farewell to the city in the mannerwe have seen him do.For hehimself besought these trials of his Lord, and he desiredthem, because, being the wise person he was, he fully comprehended the interest that accrues from this manner oftrials and persecutions, and which answers to the sum andesteem at which the same Lord Himself values them (whopermits them) and gives in return that which is a hundredfold.But why marvel at this?Let us hear what St. Jerome says in the closing wordsof his Commentaries on Sophonias —“Oh, Lord Jesus Christ! give me to be oppressed,afflicted, crushed, and repulsed in this age, so that Thoumayest receive me and set me in glory.”These are the concluding words of an excellent discourse which, for the consolation of the afflicted, Jeromehad written on the words of the prophet, in which God,speaking to Jerusalem, says (aecording to the translation ofthe Septuagint): “Behold, I will do in thee and for theein those days, and will save the crushed, and receive in methe forsaken, and will place them (He means His sons)in glory, and will name them in all the earth.”Thesense of this, says the saintly doctor, is as follows: “Ishall save her, who in this present life should be crushedand oppressed, like the olive and the grape, under the beam2 C386THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEof the wine-press and the screw of the oil-mill, in order tobring forth the oil and the wine, and of this wine JesusChrist shall drink in the kingdom of His Father, andwith the oil be anointed above all his companions andbrethren. And from the distillation of this pressing andof this ointment it strikes me Job suffered so many things,that, being well bruised and yielding these liquors andthese juices, he heard these words from the Lord: ‘Dostthou think, forsooth, that the cause was none other for myhaving thus replied, but in order that thy justice may bemade manifest ?" As though to the olive and to the vinetheir master should speak and say: “Do you believethat I have thus crushed you for any other reason but thatyou might yield up the wine and the oil which you havewithin you?’” This is of the saint, and full worthy ofbeing kept in remembrance, together with many otherthings which he adds there, drawn from the book of hisexperience, which applies to him equally well as to holyJob. We could well ask him the same question, and conclude with him in the same words as he ends a littlefarther on : “They will be confounded, oh saint | youradversaries and such as presumed to affront you; the daywill come when the wicked and those who are called powerful in this world shall see with their own eyes that thosewhom they considered unfortunate and miserable are nowenjoying felicity, and placed in the highest glory and wealthare those whom they contemned as being in poverty, andalso will they see to their grief those who in dire servitudeand miserable captivity had been set in this exile undertheir empire changed into the liberty of the celestialJerusalem, and they themselves rising up, not for a similarglory, but for eternal misery and confusion.” Up to thisall is Jerome's speech, and very much his, since it so wellfits him.PERSECUTION IN ROME387God revealed to his soul the success of his affairs; forof his rivals and adversaries there scarcely remain anyother memories but what Jerome records of them, while hehimself lives gloriously in the heavens above, and herebelow on earth in the memory of all men and in the annalsof the undying Church of God.DISCOURSE THE NIN THThe Journey of St. Jerome from Rome to the Holy LandJEROME departed from Rome, or, in his own words, heleft Babylon and the world for a second time. He leftthat city enriched by a thousand things drawn from themine of his intelligence. And in return for these goodworks he received what the world usually gives, for, evenif it would, it could give nothing better—that is to say,This time he did not go alone,persecutions and affronts.nor indeed did he go alone the first time; but now heproceeds accompanied by his brother Paulinian, a youthof great promise.He takes also with him Vincentius,a priest, and he is followed by a further holy company ofmonks, who had gathered around him when in Rome.These had resorted to that city by the fame of his name,his sanctity and letters, as did all those who wished toprofit by these things, coming from Italy, France, andother parts, he teaching them what they wanted to know,and in truth they learned much. They had not fared sobadly in his company that they should wish to separatethemselves from him, therefore they accompanied him inthis important journey, nor did they wish to leavehim until they should reach Bethlehem, where there theypersevered in the holy manner of life, which they wereMany other personsconstantlylearning from him.388VISIT TO THE HOLY LAND389These, indeed,followed and went forth with Jerome.were thespoils with which he left triumphantly theungrateful city; for they had been, and were, the witnesses both of his great virtues and the accusers of hergreat disloyalty.But a very different journey did he make now fromRome to the Holy Land than he had done the first time,because, as we have seen, the first was by land, this oneby sea, so that there should be no trouble left untasted byour saint, and he should thus be able to say with St. Paul,that he suffered trials by water and by land, from falsebrethren, in the desert, and in the cities.It was inthe month of August that, leaving the capital of theRoman Church enriched by far more precious treasuresthan the Emperor from whom the month derived its namehad increased it by the spoils of Egypt and of Asia, our newAugustus arrived at the port of Ostia, which was called theRoman Port, and there took ship with all the company wehave stated, leaving behind many others, sad and tearfulat his departure, and others also who were both on foot andon horse ready to follow. Yet there were others, again,who were full of joy at finding themselves delivered of acensor who to their mind was so outspoken, because it isever a sting to the evil-doers to have the presence of thegood, and they are harassed by the very sight of them.When he embarked, he wrote the letter we have alreadyThe winds carried the ship to the part ofmentioned.Italy called Reggio in those days, by which some haveaffirmed the island of Sicily is reached.From thence heproceeded below the Peloponnesus, which now is calledMorea, where once stood the celebrated city of Sparta; atthe present time parts of its walls are still in existence, asalso the fame of the Lacedaemonians. The course of thisvoyage is found in detail, written by the holy doctor him390THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEself, in the Apologia contra Rufinum'—to Antioch, and fromAntioch to Jerusalem, enduring great cold, for it was midwinter.He tells us in this description of the many fablesconcerning the ancients and their origin; the songs of thesirens and the gorges and caverns celebrated by theancient poets, all which may be perused by such as wish.From what relates to the purpose of the journey wemay gather that the trials and dangers from unkindmurmurs did not arrest his voyage, nor caves of Scylla,nor the ambition of Charybdis; neither is he detained bythe flatteries and sweet songs of sensuality and pleasureof the Sirens, nor was he deceived by the artifices andfalseness of the vices of the flesh, nor the malice of evilintentioned men; nor is he ruled by prosperous or adversefortune, friends or enemies, the applause of the world norits false intercourse, nor by the great city, nor the honourable offices and charges, nor false testimonies, nor falsebrethren, nor all the perils of the course of this life wereever able to detain, separate, trouble, or deter him fromfollowing his aim—the firmly determined purpose of seeking God, and of loving him with all his powers.Ourdoctor tells us that on arriving at Cyprus he was receivedwith great joy by St. Epiphanius, whose testimony andcredit Rufinus had greatly appreciated before he becameso well known. The saintly prelate was overjoyed at hispresence; to him Jerome gave a lengthy account of allthat he had gone through in Rome, and signified to himthat his desire was to live in the Holy Land, and, ifThe two saintspossible, in the cave at Bethlehem.became great friends; their souls manifested the zealwhich they had for the Christian religion, the oppositionand enmity of the heretics, the similarity of their cusApolog, in Rufin. lib. iii. c. 7.VISIT TO THE HOLY LAND39 Iof ourApologiaetoms and desires and aims being such that perforce theaffection between them increased.All this is clearlyapparent in many places in the writings of both, and inagainst Rufinus moredoctortheespecially, and the same against John of Jerusalem,where he defends himself against both very earnestly.After resting here some time he proceeded on hisjourney, going from Cyprus to Antioch, where he wasreceived in like manner by the saintly Bishop Paulinuswith no less joy than he had been by Epiphanius.In truth Paulinus owed much to St. Jerome, both forhaving given him a good character in the east with all thefaithful, because, when it was seen that St. Jerome, a manof such learning and sanctity, so great an enemy of theArians, communicated with him, all men felt assured of hisfaith and held him to be a true Catholic and saint (which intruth he was), and also because in Rome, in regard to PopeDamasus, his friendship had been of great importance tohim, and thus he had come confirmed in the Bishopric bythe Apostolic See, an act which the Pope would not do inregard to Meletius, who, although he was truly a Catholicand of great sanctity, since he merited that both theluminaries of the Greek Church, Basil and Nazianzen,should laud him with signal praises for his sanctity, yetas he had been elected and brought by the Arians fromArmenia, he did not wish to show him much favour, andthis is the whole reason given by Theodoretus for thedisfavour of Meletius shown by the Pope.In thosedays things were very disturbed, and more especially wasthis the case in regard to that Church of Antioch; even theArians themselves accused Meletius of being a Sabellian,despite that this heresy was so opposed to their own.And Theodoretus' himself says that the persecution ofTheod lib. iii. c. 5; lib. v. c. 3.392THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe Arians against the good Meletius was such that theycast him from the bishopric.It was a scheme of theArians in those days when they saw any man distinguishing himself in letters or sanctity, and that he was goingagainst the sect, to say of him that he was a heretic, pointing him out as an Origenist, or a Sabellian, or Nestorian.In this way they accused Paulinus of being a Sabellian, and even Jerome, as we said before.This wasthe journey of our doctor from Ostia, along the wholeMediterranean, to Sicily and the Peloponnesus, Cyprus,and Antioch.Jerome remained in Antioch some days.The contentions and disturbances among the prelateswere as great as ever, and continued for many years,the heretics fanning the flame (for it suits them to haveno peace).Jerome quitted Antioch accompanied by hisfriend Paulinus, and with so good a companion he reachedJerusalem, despite that others understand it otherwise.The words of the saint are these: “From Cyprus I cameto Antioch, where I enjoyed the conversation of thesaintly pontiff and confessor Paulinus, and being guidedby him we went down in the midst of the winter and itsbitter cold from Antioch to Jerusalem. On entering thelatter place I saw strange marvels, and what I had knownonly by repute I now saw with my eyes.”It must have been about the Epiphany, since he saysit was mid-winter, when, guided by his good star, Jeromeentered to adore Jesus in those holy places consecratedby His footprints, and in the wide chalice of his great heartthere would not be wanting the mystic gifts of gold, incense, and myrrh. The saintly doctor declares that hesaw with his own eyes miracles of which he had only heardby repute.I do not know what these miracles were whichhe witnessed, nor what extraordinary events to which theTripart. lib. v. c. 48.VISIT TO THE HOLY LAND393saint applies this name,I surmise that he speaks of theeyes which faith places in the soul, and that all thoseplaces which the holy Scriptures mention as having beenvisited by our Only Good were patent to his view, represented so vividly that the eyes of the body were superWhat burning sighsfluous.Oh, Divine Goodness!must he have exhaled from his breast !What sweettears must have trickled down from his eyes to his lips,and what words must he have uttered so burning from theWhat conceptions, what motives,furnace of his mind!what pregnant thoughts must have been awakened bythose marvellous memories ! How he must have countedthe footsteps taken for our salvation by our Saviour andour Life, and how he must have wept for those taken invain for us!Methinks I see Jerome kissing the ground,the stones, the walls—now on his knees, now prostrated,barefoot, standing, adoring the places where His divinefeet had passed. Who can but be fired with wrath, orgrieved at the blindness of so many heretics, old and new,who, loth to leave anything in the Church without beingsoiled, have wagged their tongues against holy pilgrimagesand visits to the holy places, scorning them as fruitless,and not satisfied with qualifying them as a thing impiousand irreligious, but even add that it be sheer idolatry !They manifest hatred towards all that can awaken andopen a path to the love of the things of God and ofHis saints.I have proposed in this history not to treat uponcommon places, nor dispute holy dogmas, but simply tofollow the office of historian, and defend the things thattouch the glory and honour of this saint; hence I will notlinger in the defence, against these censors, of holypilgrimages made by pious and devout souls.All thishas been examined by many learned men and investigated394THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEto the very fount and defended convincingly.Hence Iwill only state that it will not be outside my purpose todefend my saint and patron against them, proving thatpilgrimages are not things to be laughed at, nor idolatrous,as they blasphemously call them, but works of very highmerit.Because if there is one saint in the Churchwhom these reasons and affronts more deeply touch, itis Jerome, both on account of the many pilgrimages heperformed from his boyhood, when, as we have alreadyseen, he visited the sepulchres of the martyrs, as also byreason of the many persons he persuaded to make themfrom various parts of the world to the Holy Land, fromSpain, France, Italy, Germany, and Africa.Let us, then, hear from his own lips what he says andfeels in his soul in regard to these holy visits, where hewrites a description of his journey with St. Paula andothers to the holy places: “On coming to Bethlehemand entering the small cave of the Saviour, on beholdingthe inn and hostel of the Blessed Virgin, the stable wherethe ox knew the Lord and the ass the crib of its master,in order that thereby should be fulfilled what wasprophesied by Isaiah,” Blessed are ye that sow upon allwaters, sending thither the foot of the ox and the ass. Theholy matron would oftentimes declare to me that with theeyes of faith she could see the Infant in swaddling clothesand the Infinite Lord weeping in the crib; that she beheldthe angels entering to adore Him, and the brilliant starshining over the little house; she would see the VirginMother, the careful guardian, and the shepherds comingLikein at night, and the magi entering in to adore.manna were represented to her the murdered innocents,Herod enraged and furious, Joseph and Mary flying intoEgypt, and weeping copious tears sprung from joy and1 Epist. 27.Isaiah xxxii. 20.VISIT TO THE HOLY LAND395Hailemotion, she would cry out, Hail Bethlehem / House ofBread / where that bread was born which descended fromheaven /region, fruit£roducing, abundant in harvests, whose fulness is God /"All these sentiments does our saint employ when depicting what came forth from the heart of the holy matronat beholding these sacred places.most fertileEuphrates /In the Epistle to Marcella the saint treats of all thiswith much tenderness and eloquence, inviting her to cometo the Holy Land, replying to all the objections and difficulties which Marcella should urge against doing so. Manyare the praises poured upon the dwelling of Jerusalem forvarious reasons.It is said Adam lived and died there,and was, so it is affirmed, buried in the same place whereJesus Christ was crucified, so that the blood which flowedfrom the Second Adam should wash away the sin comAlso, because manymitted on the tree of Paradise.prophets had lived there, and the names of Jebus, Salem,and Jerusalem are the symbols of the Trinity, and manyother arguments and pious reasons, by which he declaresits grandeur.Marcella replies (so he assumes) that allthis is true, and could be well applied to those times whenGod loved the gates of Sion above all the tabernacles ofJacob, and its foundations were upon the high mountains;but that after they crucified on it the Lord of the world,and it became contaminated by so horrible a crime asthe spilling of His blood and that of the apostles andother servants of God, it justly remained cursed andforsaken by the divine grace; and that Josephus, thehistorian of the place, mentions that voices were heard inthe Temple before the coming of Titus to destroy it,which said, “Let us pass on from this place to otherdwellings.” To this Jerome replies that all this was donein hatred and punishment of the ungrateful Israelitish396THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEpeople, but not in hatred or punishment of the city andland; and that if it was destroyed, it was because of theinhabitants; the Temple fell in order that its sacrificesshould cease; and that if we consider and view the spotin itself and the city, we shall find them more noble andgrander than they had been before. The Jews formerlyhonoured the holy of holies by reason of its cherubim,for its table of propitiation, the ark of the Testament,the vessel of manna, the rod of Aaron, the table and altarof gold; and does not this seem to you more worthyAs often asof reverence, the sepulchre of the Lord?we enter in, so often is represented to us the Saviourenveloped in the winding-sheet; and on lingering a whilethere rises up at the foot of the sepulchre the angel seated,and at the head the cloths drawn together. And longbefore this sepulchre had been made by Joseph it hadbeen praised by Isaiah manifesting its majesty by saying,“And it will be the place of his rest, honour, and glory,because it was to be the sepulchre of the Lord, ordered byall.”After bringing forward many things to this purpose,he utters a sentence well worthy of such high judgment:“Throughout the world we reverence the sepulchres ofthe martyrs, and their holy ashes we place on our eyes,and, if allowed, we kiss and touch lovingly with our lips;and the sepulchre where our Lord was laid, how can anyone think it be so lightly esteemed ?If we disbelievemen, let us at least believe the devil himself and hiswicked angels, because each time that they come inpresence of this holy sepulchre they rush out of thebodies they had taken possession of they tremble, fume,and writhe as though they were at the bar and tribunal ofJesus Christ, and they repent, when too late, of havingcrucified Him whom they now fear so greatly.” Whythen do they not read this paragraph, those evil censorsVISIT TO THE HOLY LAND397of pilgrimages, and such as scorn the holy places and therelics and ashes of the martyrs?If Jerome be in theirregard of any authority, let them read this part and putaside their ignorance—unless malice has hardened theirhearts into stone.Here it strikes me that I perceive the miracles whichour saint implies he witnessed on entering into Jerusalem;and many other marvels must have taken place therewhich our saintly doctor does not mention, no doubtbecause they did not come to the purpose, or possiblybecause they were notorious and well known. The samedoes he tell us occurred at the sepulchre of St. John theBaptist,for in the Epitaph of St. Paula he says asfollows: “Proceeding farther on, she saw the sepulchreof the twelve prophets and the city of Sebaste, which isSamaria, and now is called Augusta, its name having beenchanged in honour of Augustus, at which place lie buriedEliseus and Abdias, and he who among those born ofwoman had no superior, that is to say, St. John theBaptist, where she was struck with astonishment at theprodigies she witnessed there.In her very presence shesaw with her eyes, and heard with her ears, the devilsroaring under the torture of divers torments, and in sightof the sepulchre men possessed by evil spirits howled likewolves, barked like dogs, roared like lions, hissed likeserpents, and bellowed like bulls. Some would so twisttheir heads that they touched their backs on the ground;others performed strange contortions.Paula compassionated them all, prayed for them, weeping tender tears.”From all this is sufficiently proved our proposition,and our Christian Cicero has well manifested to us thegreat power, not only natural, but heavenly and divine,which the holy places possess, to move us and awaken1 Epist. 27, c. 6.398THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEsouls to the love of celestial things, to urge us tothe imitation of the lives of those who dwelt there,to similar desires of perfection and amendment of life."Pilgrimages are not made in vain, when undertaken withrecollection and piety; for although our holy doctor bywords and example encouraged pilgrimages, yet dissuadesPaulinus, the Monk, from performing them, because forhis institute it was more appropriate to keep quiet andretired.It is not always advisable to such, whose livesare vowed to silence and retirement, for it is not good forthe monk and the nun and other religious to come and go,and lose that quietude, recollection, solitude, and reposewhich is their state.Hence we have the examples ofSt. Anthony and St. Hilarius, who, although living inPalestine, yet only once did they see Jerusalem, and thiswas done to manifest that it was a holy thing to visit theholy places.1 Concil.

He even wishedin this to be like his Master, Who, although not flyingfrom Herod, yet he was flying away as far as he couldfrom the world.This he himself states in the Apologiaagainst Rufinus, where he says: “From Jerusalem Itook the road to Egypt, and proceeded to visit themonasteries of Nitria, and among the choirs of holy monksI saw that there dwelt also poisonous asps.”We cannot desist from admiring the enthusiasm of thisgreat father and the desire of finding Christian perfection;wherever he deems he may find it, there does he journey;Lib. 3, cap. 7.3994ooTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEhe does not mind the perils of the seas or of wild lands,peoples, deserts, beasts or men.Egypt in those days wasa great school of sanctity, as in other times it had been ofWithin those deserts there had come to dwellerrors.many men of singular perfection, of so powerful aninfluence that their example sufficed to people thosewilds. Those two brave captains of this army of sanctity,Anthony and Paul, the one silently, the other by the forceof his exhortations, raised the flag, opened the road, chasedaway fear, facilitating what appeared on all counts impossible for man's power to accomplish.Jerome, by thetruth of his deeds, conquered the most absurd andmonstrous fictions of the Greeks.It did not seem to oursaintly monk that he could boast of such a name, unlessfor some days at least he studied at that school, practisingand experiencing in himself the rule of life followed. Hewould cross those deserts frightful to men of little faith,but which were more lovely to his eyes than the gardensof Italy and Athens. He sought out the monks hiddenin caves, ignored of men, but not of the angels nor ofGod, with whom they solely conversed. Some he wouldfind in the depths of caves, others in valleys even deeper,others again on rough rugged mountains, this one in anold cistern, another in a ruined house, in miserable huts,in the hollow of decayed trunks of oak and cork trees;but one and all leading lives of angels, whence theythecountless numbers, freed fromwould ascend intrammels of their bodies, to the mansions of heaven.Allthese treasures did the insatiable holy cupidity of thisdiscoverer of precious things find; he overcame thedifficulties of the roads, the roughness of the variouslands, bad passes; he would scramble up the rocks, hewould hang over precipices and make perilous descents, hefeared neither wild beasts nor poisonous reptiles, norGOES FROM JERUSALEM TO EGYPT4o Idid he care much to lose his life, who hoped to find itin death.Nothing frightened him, however arduous ormonstrous it might be, since he that loves is not dauntedby any difficulty. At times he found himself in suchnarrow passes that he could neither go forward, nor didit appear honourable to turn back; his shoes broken topieces by the sharp, rough stones, hence he had to proceedbarefooted, but he himself was very joyous, as though hewere journeying on to behold that bush which burnedwithout becoming consumed, and, judging that the spotand land was holy, he followed on to witness those livesof saints.For the sake of enjoying for a short time theconversation of a servant of God, all things appeared smallin comparison by reason of the great love he had for thisintercourse.It also seemed to him, when he met oneof these solitaries, that it was the pearl which the gospelspeaks of that was hidden in the fields, and that to obtainit, it were little to give the shoes off his feet—and eventhe very blood of those feet. The holy doctor mentionsIn thesome of these men in his Epistles and treatises.Epistle which he wrote to Eustochium on Virginity, hedescribes the variety and difference of monks existing inEgypt as we have said: Coenobites, who live in community;Remobites, which live in twos and twos or in threes andthrees; Anchorites, who dwell alone in the deserts. Ofthese, he says, that, though they live in the flesh, they livenot a life of flesh, but of the spirit, and promises to demonstrate their manner of life in another part, when occasionoffers itself.St. Jerome does not inform us what road he took fromJerusalem to Egypt.It would not have been easy forhim to do so, because as he traversed mountains andvalleys and ranges of hills, where never by any chance manhad passed, it could not be stated, and even had it been2 D4O2THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEstated, it would not have been found again.I surmise hemust have followed the track taken by the sons of Israel,when they came from Egypt to Canaan and the PromisedLand, for whereas he was to be not only master of monksand hermits, but also doctor of the Church, God guidedhim in this path, in order he should see all those dwellingplaces they made, the mansions wherein God's peoplewere sheltered in those deserts for forty years, beingsupported by faith in His word, sending down to them thebread and the meat from heaven; this surmise I base onthat divine epistle which he wrote to the saintly Fabiola,because in life he had promised it to her.In thisEpistle he reveals the secret and the spirit of what hewitnessed with the eyes of the body; and, with a geniusworthy of Jerome, declares with a continuous runningallegory the whole journey. Well pleased would I be tolinger discovering some part of this discourse, whichJerome proceeds making in these mansions and stoppingplaces, both because it would be of much profit to thesoul, as for the great pleasure its narrative would afford,as also to investigate with great diligence this road, so asto make it known for good; forasmuch as there are manyopinions respecting it, and it is not easy to decide the point.It is history that I am writing (although it is of a doctorof the Church), and therefore I dare not extend my workbeyond what touches upon the doctrine and defence of thesaint;” therefore, for the time being, let this remain indoubt, while I myself must continue without knowingthrough what route our doctor made the journey fromJerusalem to Egypt, because whereas he does not mentionfinding himself in any of these mansions, this silence givesme to understand that he proceeded by the common road.I amOf this journey he speaks in the epitaph of St. Paula.Epist. 127.Vide Hispaniam Goropii.GOES FROM JERUSALEM TO EGYPT403also doubtful whether this journey was distinct from the first.I mean to say, if he went first with only his companions,and subsequently went again, and with Paula, or went butI myself believe heonce, and then in her company also.went twice, and that in the second journey Paula wentalso. The journey was made across those sandy, desertedplaces, and uninhabitable, which lie between the Sea ofSyria and the Red Sea (Mare Rubrum). The land betweenthese is called the field of Etham. From thence they wentto the fields of Gessen, where stood the city of Rameses;the Hebrew word gasam means pluvia and rain, henceland of Gessen sounds like land of rain. These fields ofGessen lie in the lower part of Egypt, at the mouth ofthe river Nile, which is called Pelusium, and reaches to theRed Sea, and whereas here it rains, and not over the restof Egypt, the land adopted the name pluvia. And it isthe place where the patriarch Joseph received and housedhis father Jacob and his brothers, and gave them possessions wherein to live, forasmuch as it was good ground forIt is divided from the rest of Egypt at thetheir herds.part which on passing the Nile looks towards the land ofCanaan.Here is the city of Rameses, which name, ifdivided into parts, means the tribute which is given tokings on what is pastured there.I am well aware that our saintly doctor gives anotherinterpretation to this name, and means tronido de gozo, athunderclap of joy, while others say it signifies turbulentmovement (movimiento turbulento), and draws many holyallegories from either interpretation.The saint says,previous to the above words, that the holy matron St.Paula came to the river of Egypt, Sior, and writers agreethat this is the Nile, and the same called in holy ScripturesSichor and Phison. He further says that after passing theland of Gessen and the fields of Tanis, where God had4O4THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEHe here callsworked such marvels, and the city of Noph, afterwards calledAlexandria, and the town of God, Nitria, where with thesalt and chalk of the virtues are daily washed the stainsNitria City of the Lord:of many.declaring the reason, alluding to the name of nitre, saltpetreor salitre, which has the virtue and power of cleaningstains on cloth, like soap and lye. And whereas that cityhad been newly converted to the faith, and by the bloodof Christ being recently poured upon its inhabitants greatvirtues were practised and much penance done, he, withgood reason, called it the Town of the Lord. To theseholy practices many holy fathers and monks resorted whowere dwelling there, as well as from the neighbouringdesert. A huge tract of land is occupied by great desertsreaching to the confines of Ethiopia and Mauritania.Inthese there is a large wood, which is called of Nitria,between which and the city of Alexandria there standsa lake called Moeris.In this wood, as our saint states,there dwelt a large number and diversity of monks: it issaid over five thousand in number. The observance ofrules, rigour, roughness, and perfection of life followed wasadmirable.Prodigious things are related of them, andtheir deeds are the themes of many authors of the time.Among other high perfections and heroic virtues strictpoverty outshone; they possessed not one thing, be itsmall or large, which was not examined by the hands ofIn brief words he praises the sanctity ofthe superior.these servants of God, as far as it could be enhanced, inthe last phrases we have quoted above in the Apologiacontra Rufinus, for he had seen with his own eyes in thisvisit which he made that the asps dwelt amid the choirsof the monks.I put aside the allegory, which here worksagainst Rufinus, observing that some of these monks wereThe asp is a venomous serpent, and, asOrigenists.PROCEEDS TO THE DESERTS OF NITRIA405CElian says, despite that there are many varieties, yetall have so deadly a venom that their sting causes instantdeath, and the last remedy is sharply to cut off the partNotwithstanding this fact these deadly reptilesbitten.preserved such peace with these holy men, or better said,angels, that they followed the monks to the choir andlived together with them; so great was their sanctity, sofirm their faith and confidence; thus verifying to the letterwhat Isaias says” would be witnessed in the blessed timesof the gospel, that the child should confidently place itshand in the nest of the asp; and the suckling child shouldplay on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shallthrust his hand into the den of the basilisk.Here itcomes to the purpose to relate what Palladius in hisHistory says in regard to a young monk, who, meetingone of these reptiles, fearlessly took it up and carried it tothe monastery, thus showing the obedience tendered by allthings to the servants of God, and how all are subject,and give the tribute of obedience which is due to them, bynatural right, if they themselves do not deny it to God,and the malice of sin does not give them liberty to rebeland make war.This also is referred by St. Nilus in theChapters on Prayer as having occurred to many saints ofthose deserts. Of the Abbot Teon he says in ChapterCII. that being with other monks in the fields conversingon spiritual things (for this indeed was ever their conversation), there came two vipers under his feet, and he, asone who was safe, placed his feet on them, and withoutmoving continued his discourse, and at its conclusion heshowed them to the monks. The same is told of anotherholy man in Chapter CIII. that an asp came to his feet,when engaged in prayer, and he allowed it to continuehis prayer was ended, and then, withoutthere untilCElian, lib. 9, a cap. 20, usque 29.Isaias, xi. 8.406THE LIFE OF ST.

He studied the order and manner oftheir life, the perfection which by the lofty course of theirstate they had attained to, the advice and the warnings, andthe watchfulness, which have to be followed and observedagainst vices, which are the devils and the enemies of thespiritual life; he kept them all in his mind in order toprofit from them himself, and for the profit also of others;and though this stay of his among them was short, yethe never forgot the lessons he had heard and learned,for to such as have a great desire to advance a shorttime is of great value.Let the great Father Hilarionspeak, since in only two months, which he attended theschool and professed the discipleship of the great AbbotAnthony, he carried away so signally and well learned theorder and the manner of the life followed by him inacquiring virtues, in vanquishing demons, and other holyexercises and advices, that the saint boasted having so gooda disciple, calling him, with loving words, his son. Similarlycan the holy men of Nitria glory in having had, althoughbut for so short a time, such a disciple as Jerome. Onconcluding the narrative of his journey in the Apologia, hestates that he returned with hastened speed to Bethlehem,because there he had his heart and his affections.It is urged that after the departure of Jerome fromRome, the holy matron Paula soon followed, losing notime in her desire to dwell in the Holy Land. ThePAULA ARRIVES AT BETHLEHEM407journey was quickly determined upon, and I believeJerome had not yet passed from the island of Sicily, wherehe had sojourned for some time, before Paula overtookI gather this to have been the case from the wordshim.of the epitaph which he wrote at her death, where hegives the description of his journey and passage bysea, but the doctor does not say that they travelledtogether.Despite that this seems probable, yet theymay have been two journeys, and Paula have gone,as it seems, a year later, although no doubt she followedthe route taken by Jerome, more especially as her deepregard for St. Epiphanius and St. Paulinus, both havingbeen guests at her house in Rome, must have been asufficient reason for the journey to have been taken by thesame route in order to visit these holy prelates.Jerome and Paula were now to dwell in their greatlyThey chose that holy land foryearned-for Bethlehem.their only refuge, in order to pass with less turbulence thegreat waves of this life's ocean, so full of dangers.At the present day there still remains at Bethlehemsome vestiges of the chambers wherein lived St. Jeromeand where he wrote.This dwelling is not far removedfrom the temple, close to the place where our Saviour wasAnd towards the south there appears acircumcised.grotto, where many of the bodies of the holy InnocentsNicephoras and Eusebius say that St.were brought.Close to it there is aHelena built there a church.monastery of friars of St. Francis.Towards the eastare seen vestiges of the sepulchres of St. Paula and herdaughter, St. Eustochium.Let us proceed to see what St. Jerome and St. Paula,each in their way, did after their arrival.DISCOURSE THE ELEVENTHSt. Paula builds four Monasteries in Bethlehem, and St.Jerome one. He washes the Feet of the Pilgrims.SAINT PAULA, on arriving at Bethlehem, burning with thedesire of poverty as her rule of life rather than ofnecessity, enclosed herself in a small dwelling for threeThis we are told by her faithful witness, St.years.Jerome.The fame of her great virtues and sanctity hadspread to such an extent that from many parts youngmaidens of all conditions of life were flocking to be underher rule; hence it became necessary, in order to receiveso large a company, to build three monasteries. Thesethree monasteries, to my mind, were not separate buildings, but one large edifice divided into three sections.Paula also erected a fourth, a monastery for men, andbesides these four a guest-house for the reception of thecrowds of pilgrims which resorted there, from all parts ofthe world, to visit these holy places. The order followedby St. Paula in the government of these monasteries wasvery strict, and is given in detail by St. Jerome,” and maybe read by such as wish to study more intimately the lifeof this heroic matron, Paula.St. Jerome states, first, the number of monasterieserected by St. Paula as four, and a guest-house for pilgrims.1 Epist. 27.Ibid. Io.408BUILDS A MONASTERY IN BETHLEHEM409One of these monasteries she gave up to men, as well as itsgovernment, and some affirm that it was here that ourglorious Father dwelt.From this is gathered that Paulawas a very wealthy lady, for, despite that she left herdaughters and son in Rome well provided for, she yet hadsufficient left for her to undertake long voyages to BethI do not find anylehem and erect all these buildings.proof of the truth of the statement that Jerome lived inthe monastery for men built by Paula, although it wasMoreover, it is mostundoubtedly under his government.certain that St. Jerome himself erected a monastery withhis own means, and with the patrimony which he inheritedfrom his parents, and that he lived in it all the rest of hislife. This he clearly states in the Epistle to Pammachius,"addressed to him on the occasion of the death of his wife,where he says at the end: “We in this province haveerected a monastery, and another house as guest-house,lest Mary and Joseph should come to Bethlehem and notfind a house to receive them. From all the provinces ofthe world we are combated by so many companies ofmonks that we cannot abandon the commenced erection,nor have we the means to proceed with it; and whereas ithas happened to us as the Scriptures say, that we did notwell consider the cost of the tower we wished to erect, it hasbecome imperative to send our brother Paulinian to ourcountry in order to sell the hamlets, towns, and landedproperties which were left to us by our parents, and whichmay have escaped the hands of the barbarians, who havehalf-burnt them out, so that the holy work be not left byus unfinished, and thus become the scorn of evil men.”From this is manifest that our saintly doctor foundedand erected one with his own patrimony and that of hisbrother. And it will be well, before descending to details,Epist. 26.4 IOTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEits mysteries,to see in common what life he led, the time he continuedthere, for he was absent sometimes, although but for ashort period each time.During the time Paula and herdaughter Eustochium occupied their small dwelling, St.Jerome resided in a smaller, narrower one.Here hedwelt with his brother Paulinian, conversing day and nightwith God, reading the holy Scriptures, pondering over it,investigatingexercising themselves inprayer, spending whole nights in it, performing worksbefitting great servants of God, and in every way renewing the monastic life, vigorous, rough, and altogetheropposed to that of the flesh, yet most sweet and of divineflavour to the spirit. One cannot desist from admiring thegreat virtue and sanctity of Paulinian. As a boy, nay, stillquite a child, he came to be under the care of his brother,who was ever to him a father, tutor, and master, and wemay justly say he never saw the world, nor did he knowwhat it was, for he was so subject all his life to St.Jerome, what else could he be but an angel? And wedo not read, nor is it surmised that he ever caused himthe smallest displeasure, either as boy, man, or when in theposition of a priest, which is a great deal to say of brothers,since it is usual for them, even if they love each otherHere we candearly, at times to have disagreements.contemplate Jerome as in his centre, in the refined enjoyment of the objects of his affection, his tender love forthe crib, his joy at being close to that celestial cave, hecould not contain within himself the unspeakable delighthe experienced.Then, when he turned his eyes to hispast life, to that bustle and tumult of Rome, that press ofbusiness which depended on him, the many and variedconditions of persons he had to attend to, he wouldtremble at the dangerous pass he had had to traverse, andlifting up his hands to heaven, and his heart too, he would4 IIDWELLS IN BRTHLEHEMreturn thanks to the Lord who had delivered him fromso confused a Babylon | When he bent down his eyes tocontemplate the crib, there would be no tenderness nordelight in the world which could equal that which his soulfelt. From this arose that continual remembrance, whichhe makes in all his writings, of the crib and the cave, ofMary and the Infant, of Joseph, the shepherds, the star,and the magi—these are his thoughts, these his desires andyearnings, for the soul is ever more fixed where it lovesthan where it dwells. With this food did he sustain hislife, on that hay and straw did he pasture.Oh, saintlysheep ! which ever finds the manger full, because thepasture which was once placed there possessess suchneed hunger who feeds on It. The Lord Himself :plenitude of graces, such an abundance of gifts, that flonesaid it : “I am the door, by me, if any man enter in,shall be saved, and he shall go in and out, and shall findpastures.”It was through this door that he entered intothe divine secrets, lifting himself above this mortal lifein contemplation and in the participation of the hiddenmysteries of the union of the Word with man and with theflesh. At this entrance he would see his salvation and hisremedy, the true liberty and the greatly desired peace,not according to flesh and blood, but that of the spirit,which the world cannot give.Going in and coming out,a freedom which is not hampered by Pharaoh, because ifthe Son truly gives liberty, truly will he be free in spiritand in truth, a thing which the servant cannot give. Tofind pasture, by which to support life, is a proof and sign ofa sovereign providence, and such as the life is, such alsois the food; and such did Jerome find in the crib.Oh,life of a saintHow few they are who know it, how fewfind it, how few seek it, although so manifest that it isJohn x. 9.4 I2THE LIFE.6F ST.

Not that ithould be read, no indeed! by the senate of doctors, nor thatit should be placed in the old library along with the worksof the ancients, but simply because our saintly Marcellaurged me to hurry on with the work. How often is sheI bear in mind her solicitudes and herin my memory !desires, and as often do I condemn my own tepidity andmy slothfulness, because being as I am all in solitude, andin the enjoyment of this monastic peace, and having beforeme the crib at which, coming in haste, the shepherdsadored the weeping Child, I am not able to do that whicha noble woman, in the midst of the noise of her family andthe cares of her household, knows how to effect in itsproper time and at appointed hours!”Jerome was in an extreme degree a lover of solitude,and of the fields, and, withdrawing himself to his littlecell, he never lost the good habits of the monk and ofthat early life of the desert.Often does he refer to themin his writings to Theophilus, St. Augustine, to RufinusPsalm xlix.DWELLS IN BETHLEHEMand others; and unless the many needs of the governmentof his monks or the presence of guests brought him out,he always retained his loved solitude.It was in solitudethat he gathered together those treasures with which heenriched the Church by his writings and prayer; it was therethat he enjoyed the delightful moments of contemplation.Replying to Vigilantius, he employs the following wordstowards the end of the book:” “Virtue is a rare thing:it is attained by few, and would to God all should be liketo these few, of whom it is said, many are called and feware chosen, because very soon should we see prisons empty.The monk has not the office of doctor, but of weeper,because to him belongs the duty of weeping for himselfand for all the world, and he is with fear awaiting thecoming of the Lord.Such a one, because he knows hisweakness, and how fragile is the vessel he carries withinhim, fears to meet stumbling-blocks, lest he should fall andbreak it.

And this example inducedmany to come to him from all parts of the world, to imitatehim, and place themselves beneath his discipline in theseholy places, forsaking country, parents, and all the comforts of the world.During the first years of the sojournhere they were housed the best way they could; in thatpoverty and want of all comfort they lived contented, untilJerome and Paula erected the monasteries and guest-housewherein those resorting there could be entertained as ina monastery.forThe holy doctor followed another exercise, by which hehas shown us how deeply rooted humility was in his soul.All pilgrims and guests who resorted to Bethlehem (andthey were many) had him to wash their feet. A greatwork indeed, but greater the virtue, and greater still hismerit. A labour indeed worthy of so great a saint, alabour sprung from a faith which in truth was not dormant.Who would have said that so grave a doctor, intellectuallyoccupied in such deep subjects, elevated to the most excellentdegree in the sacred letters, should abase himself to solow a work? This most certainly would not be said ofthose who seek the study of the science of theology forlesser ends than those which the title and profession teach.Jerome had learned this in the sacred Scriptures; thus it wasthat the crib was teaching him.This thing did he practisein Bethlehem. This comes of living in the Holy Land—theimitation of the life of One Who by His example left itWASHES THE FEET OF THE PILGRIMS415sanctified, for He did not order us, when He washed thefeet of the disciples, that we should go to live in the HolyLand, but to do what He did when He was there.This isdeclared by Jerome himself, when forced by a calumnyraised against him by Rufinus that he had receivedkindly a priest calledPaul, whom Bishop Theophilushad deprived of his office. He says: “Our intention andaim in the monastery is to exercise hospitality, and all whoare received come to us with benign countenance, for wefear lest Mary and Joseph should not find a shelter in ourhospice, and then Jesus being cast out should address us inthese words: I was a stranger, and you received me not.Itis solely heretics we do not receive, and these are alonethose you receive. Our whole solicitude is to wash thefeet of all those who resort to us, but not to examine theirmerits.”This exercise was very proper to such a saint, for itsprang from the profound consideration of what had beenpractised by the One only Master.It has been said bysaints, and in truth with great sanctity, that it was notonly an example, but that it was a sacrament.Anexample it was, wherein He manifested His love, and gaveus the three proofs which are to be found in love, becauseHe not only washed the feet of His friends, but even ofthose who, bereft of discretion, persist in not wishing tobe healed of their evils.Yet the proof does not end here,for He also washed the feet of the enemy, even of him,who at the very moment of His washing them, was actuallydeliberating in his heart how he could carry out the sale andThis is the example, and thustreachery of His betrayal.does He ordain we should do and serve Him, for ourservice is profitable to our friend, to the impertinent, tothe enemy, from the lowest to the highest office, whetherIt was the sacrahe be humble, or whether he be great.416THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEment which Peter did not comprehend then, though as forthe example all present understood it. He who is clean hasno need that his head and hands be washed, but only hisfeet, for none can be called clean who has his head, face,and hands soiled. To have the feet clean and washed bythe hands of Christ was a great sacrament, which was notunderstood by Peter until he saw it carried out on himself.All this requires more space in order to understand itthoroughly. Our Jerome imitates the first, leaving for itsowner the second; he manifests equally to all his lovewithout difference, he embraces all; and whereas, after along journey, those who come on a pilgrimage are footsoreand wounded, they have need that for their sake thislabour of humility and comfort be exercised on them.Charity brings down Jerome to wash such feet; andeven should Judas himself come, who intended to sell him,this treachery would not mitigate or cool his love, for hewould also wash him, for so it was enjoined by the Master.This mustering together of many religious peoplecaused a goodly assortment of clever intellects to cometogether, capable of conversing and treating on grave andlearned questions, and thus raise the standard to something higher than the holy rusticity of the deserts.Jerome, by night and by day, occupied himself inexpounding the holy Scriptures. He arranged times andplaces in which, after the completion of the divine office andother monastic duties, each, as it fell to him, explained andexpounded the sacred Scriptures, more especially thePsalms, which were ordinarily what was most practised,Itand the melody, which was constantly on their lips.was the translation of the Septuagint which was generallyused in choir, although, as we have seen, he himself hadmade another translation from the Hebrew, but he madeuse then of the one with which all were familiar.WASHES THE FEET OF THE PILGRIMS417We shall farther on examine and investigate whetherthe exposition of the Psalms which is circulated as hisamong his works be really so; now, it suffices to haveunderstood the common exercises followed by our saint,and his ordinary occupations, which, as we have seen, areall full of sanctity and perfection.2 EDISCOURSE THE TWELFTHWhat St. Jerome effected during the First Pears of hisResidence in Bethlehem.HAvING stated what in general was the routine led by oursaint in the ordinary way after his arrival at Bethlehem,and what his occupation during the course of his life,which in truth God granted to him to be of such lengththat of none of the doctors of the Church do we find anywho exceeded him in years, it will be well now to descendto particulars, and see in detail what especial works heeffected, according to the events of the age, for thecommon benefit of the Church. The first of the laboursundertaken, after coming to Bethlehem, was the translationof the Book of Solomon, which in Hebrew is calledInCoheleth, in Greek Ecclesiastes, in Latin Concionator.the original it is in the feminine gender, because the mindand wisdom which was in the son of David, Solomon, mostwise king, were what formed the sum and reason of thisbook. When narrating the occupations of St. Jerome inRome, we spoke of his having made that book the subjectmatter of his discourses with the holy women he hadinstructed there, which, coming as it did from such amaster, was of great force. He had promised Blesilla—who was one of those who more largely profited by histeaching, as was seen by her change of life—to write a418WORK IN BETHLEHEM419time,after, he alsocommentary upon this book.This remained for the timebeing in abeyance, because God took her soul to heaven,but now he undertakes the translation from the Hebrewinto Latin, and thus puts in writing what he had given byword of mouth.About thiswroteor soonlearned books against Jovinian, a heretic, whose errorsand life corresponded.Jovinian had been first a monk,but finding the monastic life too rough, determined toleave it; he became a priest, and his efforts were directedto amassing a great fortune.In order to colour hiswretched aims and maintain his apostasy, despite that hewas neither learned nor eloquent, he was minded tobecome a master, and thus teach a doctrine very muchout of his own head, and like to his wickedness. Amonga number of absurdities, which were pointed out by St.Augustine, St. Jerome, and others, was the one that themarried life was not of less merit than virginity; also thatit was of no consequence to fast or not to fast, to liveluxuriously or to abstain, and other things similar, veryproper to such as renounce their religious habit, and fromthat exalted state fall into the abyss of great evils; henceit is quite just that the whole world should detest theseIn Rome he found some to follow his evilbad people.doctrine, but these were a few of low condition, andsome other monks like himself.His graver followerswere Felix, Plotinus, Genial, Martial, and others; these,along with their master, proceeded to spread the poisonthroughout Rome, which took effect on weak characters,women of loose lives, and lawless people. The friends ofSt. Jerome wrote to him, and gave him an account of allthat was passing, sending him the book of these doctrines, inorder that he should refute these errors, reply to him, andundo his malice. Rome had not forgotten her Jerome,42OTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEand in her distress seeks him, and from the cave ofBethlehem demands of him to enlighten and defend herwith his pen and doctrine. Our great Father did so, andwith so much eloquence and speed that it seemed like aflash of lightning which had come forth from the East andappeared in the West. And whereas this was the firstwork which on this second visit he was sending to Romefrom the Holy Land, he manifested in it great erudition,genius, subtlety, and eloquence. Had it occurred that noother memorial of St. Jerome would have remained to usbut this one book, it would amply suffice to make knownto us who Jerome was, and prove whether he merited tohold a first place in the ranks of sacred and profane writers.To such of my readers as may think I go too far, I prayhim to read the work carefully, and he will acknowledgethat I fall short of the truth.On the arrival of these books in Rome, I am unable tosay whether it took place before Pope Siricius or Ursinus(both these names being used by authors) had convened aI myself thinkcouncil in the same city, or after doing so.it was previously, and that, when the Pope had seen thesebooks, he greatly marvelled at so high a doctrine, and hegathered together all the prelates he could, who numberedeighty, and condemned the heretic and his followers, andcast them out of Rome.From thence they went on toMilan, from which, by mandate of the Pope, they were inlike manner cast out, as appears by an epistle of the samepontiff. They then passed on to Africa, and spread theirpoison there, their poison being more deadly than that ofthe serpents of Libya, and there also was gathered againstthem the Council of Telus.By that council they werealso condemned, notice being given to Pope Siricius, towhom they wrote a letter, wherein, among other things,it was declared that they were, with their evil sect,WORK IN BETHLEHEM42 Isubverting the order of the Church, removing good worksand merits, and regretting that they had formerly fasted,giving themselves up to the delights of the table and alife of pleasure. The holy doctor, at the commencementof his book, calls them Christian Epicureans, wishing tojoin Christ with Epicurus, a thing more difficult than tojoin hell with heaven. When the book arrived in Romeit was perused with great applause by all friends, as alsoby others who were well disposed towards the Church,being well grounded in the faith and good customs.There were others, however, who were not so clean ofthe pest, and those who still bore a long-standing ill-willagainst Jerome—all these read and examined the work,not in order to profit their souls, but for what they couldfind fault with and calumniate. These evilly disposed spiritsturn all things into venom ! The greatest calumny theycould invent against him was to say that, wishing overmuch to enhance the state of virginity, he had cast to theground the state of matrimony, even to the point of seeming to condemn it. On this subject Pammachius, whenadvising him of the calumny brought against him, wrotean epistle beseeching Jerome to reply categorically andexonerate himself.This the saint did, and with his usualforce and accustomed elegance clearly manifested themeaning of his own words. Among other skilful reasonshe, in the first lines, says as follows: “If I rememberrightly, the question between Jovinian and ourselvesconsists in that he equals virginity to matrimony, and wemake the latter much inferior to it.

JEROMEelse but virginity under vow.It also seems very clear bythese words of our saint that, when he wrote the Apologia.in defence of his book, Pope Siricius had already held thecouncil against the heretic, and that Pammachius had takena large part in this, viz. that of soliciting Jerome to writeagainst Jovinian, and had obtained his reply, and had presented it to the Pope. The learned doctor at once adds:“This is certain, that between the sentence of Jovinianand mine there is no middle term, hence it stands thus,If I am repreeither this or that has to be followed.hended because I make matrimony inferior to virginity,let him be praised who equals them. And, if he is alreadycondemned because he judged they ran together, his owncondemnation is the approbation of my book. Had men ofthe world and of our own time grown angry with me becauseI placed them lower in the scale than the virgins, I wouldnot have been surprised; but it is to me most certainly anovelty that priests and nuns, and others practising continency, should not praise the very state they live in.”I would like to transcribe here more out of thesebooks, not so much with the object of convincing the .heretics of these times, who have endeavoured to draw outfrom the pit of hell these same errors which the Church hadlaid and buried there so long ago (for this was done verylearnedly by others), but that in our own tongue shouldbe made manifest the great erudition of our saint, but Ifear to obscure it by my pen.After this letter from his friend Pammachius, Jeromereceived another similar one with the same advices and onthe same case from another great friend, called Damian.He informed him that a certain monk, who undoubtedlyhad been tainted with the leprosy of Jovinian, and wasgratified with the doctrine of a licentious life, had also setmany objections to the book of the saintly doctor, passingWORK IN BETHLEHEM.423as a learned man among a certain class of women and thelower ranks of men.These were the first labours that came forth from thecave of the crib performed by St. Jerome, and upon a veryapposite occasion. The first was the art and the doctrine ofthe renunciation of the world, the knowledge and disillusionof its vanity. The second, the defence of virginity and itspre-eminence and loftiness; the defence, also, of holyfastings and works of perfection.These were his exercises.His desire was that allshould be proved in them, and be found true in each andall of them. He could not brook that any man shouldattempt to hurl them down from their position, and sothey should understand that, placed in the porch ofBethlehem as he was, and like to a lion of the tribe ofJuda, he must needs roar lustily against the heretics, andsimilarly to a fountain and cistern of most delicious waters,be the drink and refreshment of the pious and of thesaintly.BOOK THE FIFTHSIXTH A G E – SEN ESCENCE425PROEMAccorDING as itis recorded by Plato in his Dialogues,Socrates used to say " that he delighted in the conversationof the aged and to confer with them.The reason hegave, which in truth is a very good one, was as follows:“If I am obliged to follow a road, it is of importance toknow its conditions from such as have already gone thatway; whether it be a good or bad one, a difficult pass oreasy, what perils and dangers may have to be met with,and learn from the old men what their experience has been,in order to profit from it, hence how can we spend timebetter than in listening to their narrative?” Nor is thisknowledge to be sought for indiscriminately from any oldman.

Dial. de Justo, 1.427428THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEforth loaded with spoils, victories, and crowns, by sheervirtue and prudence.Our Jerome had arrived at the sixthage in man.It is from this number that it took its name,being called the Senario of the Ages or, as others have it,Senectus, through the deficiency of that virtue or manlyvigour which up to that age they had preserved.But nosuch thing will be said of St. Jerome, because, if up to thishe has lived forty-nine years of his life, and now entersinto his fiftieth, and this period lasts seven years, that is tosay, until fifty-six or fifty-seven, he has been most diligentin labouring and serving the Church with extreme care,without ceasing to exercise himself in acquiring virtues, noless shall we see him in the future avoiding idleness.To old men is applied the humiliating expression thatthey are in their second childhood, because at this periodthey are supposed to return to what they were as infants,not only as regards the conditions of the body, childish andweak, but also as regards the state of the soul. We shallnot see this fulfilled in Jerome; because even when he hasentered the age of decrepitude, we shall find him robustand clear, as during the former course of his life.In him,in a certain sense, the truth will be verified that he willbecome a boy again, because on entering this period of oldage he will not disdain still to learn, and again to seekmasters.In this he desires ever to be youthful and a boy,ever going forward, if anything offers itself to be learned.The contrary is what is usually done by the advanced inage; it seems to them that age is a quittance of all ignorance,and that with the authority of grey hair, without anythingfurther, they are competent to afford a solution to whateveris asked of them.It is such as these that the Holy Spiritcurses, to whom is addressed these words: “Cursed be theboy of a hundred years, for at the end of that time he hasno more principle in his heart nor has he acquired morePROEM429in his understanding than a child, restless and empty."The best food for old age is the labour of youth; thosewho would not work in their day, now they die of hunger,like the sluggard who would not work in the summer onaccount of the heat, nor in the winter time by reason of theJerome loses no time. He might well now enjoycold.that which with so much labour he had sown and gathered;yet not satisfied with this, he wishes to commence anewand amass greater wealth, not indeed for his more advancedage, but to enrich his sons.The age of forty-nine is a marked one in the scale oflife, and a perilous pass among the climacterics, becausethen is joined together seven sevens—a week of years.During this period or age, our great doctor intends entering into a new phase of his life, and begins, as it were, toascend the ladder with redoubled courage, since there stillremains to him of life as many number of years as he hadJerome fully comprehends that the numberalready passed.forty-nine, although by the holy Scriptures it is celebratedas a jubilee, being held so after a week of weeks, which areseven times seven, when possessions are returned to theirowners, and a general remission is made of debts at thesignifies the principal Feastsound of trumpets, alsoof Pentecost, in which, after the passing of seven weeks, theLaw was given to the people of Israel on the Mount, thenext day being the fulfilment of the fifty, a number consecrated to penance, as the doctor himself teaches us, whenexpounding the third chapter in Isaias; and in confirmationbrings forward for this most extraordinary passages. Thesame does he confirm in the Chapter XLI. upon Ezechiel.Entering into this period, Jerome purposed to take topenance more strictly, since the jubilee was celebrated forthe time and years that were past, and now, on entering anew period, it seems to him that the tenour of the Law is43oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEintimated to him; for although it be the same as the naturallaw, yet as up to the time he had been robust and strong,nevertheless his very energy and consequent fire may haveobscured what God had written on the Soul; hence herenews the covenant which God Himself had come down todeclare on the Mount. When a man has been neglectfulup to the forty-ninth year of his age, during which periodhis powers and vigour had kept him energetic and assiduous,he has some excuse, and a jubilee may be granted him; buton reaching the fifties, and entering upon this period, thathe should not perceive the calls of God, and not weep overthe defects of his past life, is a great evil.Aristotle saysthat in youth shame is a virtue, but not in an old man,because if youth with growing age may be guilty of indiscretions, if he be ashamed of them, it appears as a signof repentance to blush on having his fault discovered; butan old man should not, and must not, do aught which hemight be ashamed of, nor has nature the flow of bloodthen with which to flush his face : he must needs be disabused as he is entering his year of jubilee, when allmust turn to their natural Lord.This does Jerome teachus at this period when he is entering upon old age, if we onlypay attentive heed, and watch and note his course of life.DISCOURSE THE FIRSTSt.Jerome guits Bethlehem for Alexandria, to converse withDidymus.How it befits saints to have lowly opinion of themThis virtue of humility is able to effect greatselves!things, when truly and without deceit it takes root in theheart.It appears to Jerome that there is yet time to bea disciple, and that there is in others a great deal to belearned, and that in himself there is nothing for others tolearn, and that, if at any time he attempts to teach, it isbecause he is importuned to do so. The whole worldholds him as a master; to him resort men as to a flowing, powerful fountain; meanwhile, he himself is seekingmasters from whom to learn.In his opinion he is so farbehind, that without regard to the fact that he inspiresgreat respect, without a glance at the opinion in which heis held in Rome and in the whole of the West, withoutconsidering that his monks and his spiritual children mightrepose less confidence, and his credit be thereby diminished,he goes to be a listener to Didymus in Alexandria. Undoubtedly thisblind Didymus was very learned andenlightened in the sacred Scriptures; his fame was greatthroughout the East, and he knew much.It occurredtherefore to Jerome that it would be right and useful tofrequent his school and place himself at his feet as his431432THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEdisciple. On this point Jerome always continued to followthe manner of learning which we have mentioned alreadyat the beginning of the Second Book, namely seeing,communicating, and conversing face to face, and hearingthe living voice, for it appeared to him that thereby therecould be no deception, while that which is only seen writtendown suffers deception.Didymus was a native of Alexandria. When quite aboy a severe illness affected his eyes, and he became totallySt. Jerome tells us that his illness came upon himblind.so early in life that he could have had no idea of the formand type of letters.Others say that at the time he wasalready learning grammar; but who could know better thanhe who on purpose visited and conversed with him, asSt. Jerome didAnd Jerome speaks and enlarges uponthis blindness as to a miracle, that he should have had noNot only wasknowledge of having seen letters in his life.Didymus remarkable as a great and keen dialectician, butalso was so learned a mathematician that it seems on allincounts miraculous how he was particularly clevergeometry, a thing which depends so largely on sight, moreespecially to beginners, and of such assistance that it seemsutterly impossible to attainthis science without sight.Moreover, he was a great arithmetician, for the one thingfollows the other. As for rhetoric and the art of speaking,few, or none, excelled him in his time. Yet the long sightwhich God gave him in his soul, in exchange for that whichwas denied him corporally, was not circumscribed to thispoint, because he rose up with such lucidity and advantageto consider the divine mysteries, and elucidated so many ofthese and such hidden ones in the Old and New Testaments that he far outstripped nearly all the learned menof his age.That which the great Anthony, the Father ofHermits, said to Didymus, when he came to converse withCONVERSES WITH DIDYMUS433him in Alexandria, is worthy of being enlarged on, for hefound him somewhat hurt, and sad at his want of sight, butAnthony consoled him with these words: “Do not grieveand be sad, O Didymus! at the want of sight in your eyes,a thing common to imperfect men and to animals, butrejoice that other eyes have been given you very similar tothose of the angels, by which God is seen and contemplatedin light divine!”Oftentimes does our doctor allude to this sentence.Among others, he says: “My Didymus having those eyeswhich are attributed to the Spouse of the Canticles, and thosechannels of light with which our Master, Jesus Christ, badeHis followers lift their eyes to see the harvest which wasbecoming white, looks down from the highest point andrenews to us in himself those ancient times when theprophets were called seers.Whoso would read himwill perceive in him the thefts of many of our Latins, andwill belittle the streamlet when he commences to enjoyHe is not distinguished inthe fountain and source.The former manifestsstyle, but he is so in science.him to be an apostolic man, both in the clearness of thesense and in the simplicity of his words.”Didymus wrotemany works, as appears in the catalogue which our saintmade of them in his work on Illustrious Masters, manycommentaries upon the sacred Scriptures, and merits fromthem an everlasting name.Jerome quitted Bethlehem in order to seek out and converse with Didymus, proceeding to Alexandria at the ageabove mentioned, and at the time that grey hair coveredHe communicated his doubts to Didymus;his head.he penetrated his manner of expounding theology; he recognised in the man a lofty genius; he learned from himmany things he had not yet attained; he drew from himAd Paulinianum fratrem, in Proaemio, lib. De Spiritu Sancto.2 F434THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEmany secrets: it was in truth a journey of great profit.St. Jerome, writing to his two friends Pammachius andOceanus, confesses it in his epistle to them, where he says:“My hair was already grey, and from my age it were moreproper to be a master than a disciple, nevertheless Ideparted for Alexandria, and constituted myself a hearer ofI return him a thousand thanks for manyDidymus.things, and I owe him much, because I learned what I didnot know, and what I had knowledge of I did not lose orforget through what he had taught me.”It appears to me that these last words gives us to understand that many things which he had found with his geniustallied with what Didymus told him both extraordinary andIn the preface of the Commentaries on the Epistleexcellent.to the Ephesians he confirms the above.“I have notceased to read since I was young,” he says, “nor have Iceased to ask what I did not know from learned men; norhave I made myself my own master, like many others do,who presume thus.It was chiefly for this reason that Inot very long ago journeyed to Alexandria to see Didymusand ask of him all that was a cause of doubt to me in theholy Scriptures.”From these words will be clearly perceived the desireof this holy doctor, for, at an age when he could soworthily have been a master, as he himself confesses,yet he so earnestly assumes the form of a disciple.Inthis we have the examples of men of fame such asThemistocles, Cato, Solon, and others who acted similarly.The first said when he was at the point of death, thathe was sorry to die because death came just at the verytime when he was commencing to learn, and he was then107 years of age. The second, when over sixty beganleisurely to learn Greek, while the last surpassed these,for, on being asked how long should a man continue toCONVERSES WITH DIDYMUS435learn and be a student, he replied that he should beone as long as he lived. And if to these wise men weadd a fourth — and that one Jerome—he will tell youJeromewith his work what the others do by words.never made a truce in his desires for learning.Well hashe proved all this up to the present stage, when he isalready grey, and still his thirst will not be slaked northe wrinkles of extreme age prevent him.Between Didymus and Jerome there was establisheda great friendship; the great Didymus delighted in havingsuch a disciple.I believe they alternately changed places,and that, if Jerome made progress under Didymus, noless did Didymus profit by Jerome. He soon perceivedthe great genius and intellect of our saint, and he esteemedthis great man so much that he judged him a good subjectto whom to dedicate his works.Didymus had finishedsome very learned commentaries upon Osee, and dedicatedthem to Jerome, feeling that his labours would be blessedwhen placed under such a defender and patron; and in truthit is most certainly great praise for a Latin doctor to beso highly esteemed by him who was considered the flowerof the whole of Greece, furthermore Didymus was mucholder than Jerome.He was also asked by Jerome tomake some commentaries upon Zacharias, which he didat his petition.The translation which St. Jerome was making of thebook of Didymus, Of the Holy Ghost, for Damasus, aswe said before, but which, owing to circumstances thatintervened, he had put aside, he subsequently finished whenin Bethlehem, as appears by the first words of the prefaceaddressed to his brother Paulinian, to whom he dedicatesthe translation of the three books.After Jerome had enjoyed the company and conof Didymus, and gathered together all heversation436THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEcould, which surpassed his expectations, like a well-freightedship, he returned from Alexandria to Bethlehem, loadedwith precious information, a merchandise which time couldnot corrupt and which could not be stolen by the handsof pirates. He was received with great joy by Paula,and by all his brethren, as is the case when a dearly lovedfather returns to his children, full of great expectations ofdoubling his wealth. .DISCOURSE THE SECONDSt. Jerome seeks a Hebrew preceptor, in order to perfecthimself in the language.ON returning to Bethlehem, Jerome resumed his accustomedexercises of virtues, prayer, reading, and meditation, evenjoining to these a rigorous penance, hair shirts, fastings,watchings, and chastisement of the rebel flesh.All thesewere to Jerome his daily bread: it seemed to him that hewould not be a monk, were he to neglect these exercises,nor should he deserve to bear such a name, if he eveneffected a truce with them. We shall continue to see inthis saint that each time he speaks of things relating toreligion and the monastic life, he ever sets these obligationsto the office and state, as though native and essential toMoreover, he always keeps in mind that he isthem.doctor of the Church, although as to this, in secret andwithout even perceiving it himself, he is impelled by theDivine Spirit, hence his thought is never outside thelaw of the Lord; it is to this law that he withdraws inthe secret of the night, and in the deepest and mostprofound of his thoughts naught elseis treated onnor considered. At times he found, when engaged inthis exercise, that it was of importance, in order to runmore freely along in these holy studies, to have a fullerknowledge of the Hebrew language, and that there should437438THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEbe no excellence which he could not attain, or beignorant of, and that to this greater knowledge of Hebrewshould be added, with advantage, the study of Chaldaic,on account of its nearness to it, and because there aremany books in the sacred Scriptures which partake verylargely of this mixture of both languages.But thisknowledge is not sufficient even so, nor are all thedifficulties solved by this study of the tongues, for it isalso necessary to join to these a knowledge of the history,antiquity, customs, traditions of that ancient people, andtheir rites, and that of other races with whom they mixedand communicated, whether through captivity or by permission. To learn their familiar intercourse, policy, modeof government, and all else that is proper to a nation,for otherwise, without this knowledge and care, greaterrors creep in, when speaking incautiously of the holybooks, as we clearly perceive when we examine the manydifferences which exist between ourselves and the nativesof Africa, or between the Christian republic and that ofthe Turks, or between the Spanish and the Arab races.There are infinite allusions to this in the sacred Scriptures,by reason of which we stumble at every step. Jerome perceived this deficiency; he was minded to effect a remedyForby making himself conversant with all these studies.this end he sought a Hebrew by nation, who should beamong that people considered learned in the law, toinstruct him in what he desires to know.He wantedto hear from him the manner of expounding Scripture,and proceed carefully, noting all particulars, which thingsbeing what they were could not be known by one notreared among them.I feel confident that this was an inspiration from God, in order that His Church should possessin Jerome all that on this score might yet be wantingto her, at least as much as sufficed to give light, and sensePERFECTS HIMSELF IN HEBREW439to open the eyes of the minds of those who wouldsubsequently follow, and thus be able to know how toseek and carry to a conclusion all that in the things ofthis kind should still require investigation, and whichit was not possible for our saint to carry out.Origenlikewise adverted to thislabour, who was a man ofgreat genius, and laborious, and he even sought for Hebrewmasters, both for the language and for what I have mentionedabove; but his diligence, however, was of small fruit,since his dogmas and doctrines, set on wrong foundationsand perverse aims, erased what there was of good inrelationto the exposition of the Scriptures, as wellas by employing over much allegory he was unable todiscover truly the force of the letter and the marrowof the Scriptures, for the aim of the spirit is not attainedproperly without the study of the plain facts of historyand the coherence of the letter.St. Jerome, following out this idea, sought for andfound a Jew, by name Barahanina, or Barračino, who, itis supposed, dwelt in Jerusalem, and obtained, at a heavyprice, that he should teach him what he knew of Hebrew,and his knowledge of the traditions of his teachers. TheJew was greatly moved to do this by the high priceoffered, for the Jews are by nature covetous, and also fromwitnessing inSt. Jerome a great desire and interestin all that appertained to the Jewish law, although hewas not aware why Jerome so greatly desired this. Onthe other hand, the Jew ran a great risk and danger fromthose of his own nation and parentage, because itisforbidden to their race, under heavy penalties, to communewith the Christians, or teach them the secrets of the law,This Hebrew knew not what to do: cupidity was felt onboth sides, that of the Jew on account of gain, and Jerome,who burned with the desire at any price to learn these440THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEsecrets, which fact decided the question, and it was arrangedthat the Rabbi should come secretly, and by night, to giveJerome his lesson: in this way the danger to the oneAllwas averted, and the desire of the other fulfilled.this knowledge held by the Jew he very well knew howto enhance and sell at a great price.Jerome did notobject to give him all he could, because the treasures ofearth, compared to the science of the Scriptures, bearno proportion whatever.This statement our saint hasmade oftentimes, although in brief words. When writingto Pammachius and Oceanus, after narrating the journeyhe had taken to Alexandria, he says as follows: “Menhad judged I had ceased to be a disciple and a student.That in me had ceased the desire of learning, yet on myreturn to Jerusalem from Alexandria, and from Jerusalemto Bethlehem, God knows with how much labour, andeven at what a price, it cost me to possess as preceptorthe Jew Barahanina, who came to me in the night time,and through fear of the Jews resorted to me at those hours,and who fancied himself to be another new Nicodemus.”From this is understood how far from reason was Rufinus,and how full of malice he was in reprehending St. Jeromefor an act which brought so much advantage to the Church,that of studying these subjects so thoroughly and fullyin the Hebrew tongue itself, and for seeking preceptors toenlighten him, buying, so to say, that knowledge becauseit was on sale.To Rufinus it appeared that St. Jerome committed akind of sacrilege in doing this, and he makes a puerileallusion to Barahanina and Barabbas by saying that ourdoctor was like to the Jews, who, when Pilate gave thechoice between Jesus and Barabbas at thePassover,chose Barabbas and denied Christ, that in this way hadBut in quite another manner did theJerome acted.PERFECTS HIMSELF IN HEBREW44 IChurch judge Jerome, and the effect demonstrated it, as ithas been clearly proved by those who so largely haveprofited by his pious labours.Many, even in our day,act in a similar manner, for, on finding that some oneattains to the knowledge of the Hebrew tongue, they atonce suspect him of denying Jesus Christ for Barabbas, anJerome took no heedidea worthy only of ignorant men.of this calumny: he simply replied to it as a thing worthyof laughter, and in the Apologia addressed to Rufinus hetells him: “I have heard it said of the epistle I addressedto Rome, that you picked out some things, in order tophilosophise against me, and that, like a grave manand a thinker, you judge and speak witticisms likeanother Plautus, because I said that Barrabino, a Jew,was my preceptor. And I do not marvel that, when thereis an allusion to the names Barahanina and Barabbas,is commonyou should have written Barabbas, since itto you in these similarities of names to take such licencethat from Eusebius you make a travesty into Pamphiliusand from martyr, heretic; from which I perceive thatit becomes needful to equal oneself to you, and it behovesme greatly to keep as far as possible from you, becauseduring the space of time required for reciting two creeds,without my knowing how or when, you might make out ofJerome, Sardanapalus.”And in order the better to understand the feeling andintention which urged our saintly doctor to study thethings of the Hebrews, and what were the things he everwanted to learn from them, and what was the advantagehe sought thereby to gain for the Church, let us linger tohear from him in a few brief words a declaration of hisintentions and thoughts.In the already quoted epistleto Pammachius he added these words: “If by any reasonApolog. lib. i. c. 3.442THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEit may be permissible to abhor any kind of men, andabominate any nation, I confess that I have a particularhatred against the Jews, because up to the present daythey persecute Jesus Christ in their synagogues.” Andwhen expounding those words of Isaias,” “Thus saith theLord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to the Soul thatis despised,” he declares that these words fitted the personof Christ, because like a good shepherd He laid down Hislife and His soul for His sheep, and for their sakesdespised it: and this is an abomination to the Jews, andthus they meet together threetheirsynagogues to curse His name under the name ofA/azarene.times dailyinThe Jews were well aware that their great evils andfall came to them from the death of Christ, and, insteadof opening their eyes under the chastisement, they hardenedthemselves and became worse, as Pharaoh did in formertimes: and in this same blindness do they continue, andwill continue, until it shall please God to fulfil what, throughHis Holy Prophets and Apostles, He has promised—toopen their eyes, in order that they should know that whichfor so long they had waited, and Him whom, when they hadHim in their own hands, they had reprobated; and let nottheir gain be our own fall, a thing we have greatly to fear.They being native branches,” God broke them down, for theirinfidelity, from the trunk in order to engraft us therein.

Whoevershould wish to enter further on this point of the Hebrewinterpretations, let him read over the preface of theExposition of the Lamentations of Jeremias by St. Jerome,as this discourse would otherwise exceed its properIn easure.DISCOURSE THE THIRDOn some of the Pious Labours which St. Jerome undertookfrom the Hebrew to enrich the Church.Whereas inSt. JEROME did not rest satisfied with what learning he hadattained from the study and acquisition of the languageswhich, at the cost of so much labour and expense, he hadlearned.the holy Scriptures there weresome books written in the language of Chaldea, such asthe books of Daniel, Esdras, Judith, his friends gave himno peace in their importunities until he translated theminto Latin, and he undertook this work, which necessitatedthe study of Chaldean, a labour that he himself calls great,for it was the study not of what is called Syro-chalalaic,which is the common language of Palestine, and the oneconsecrated by our Lord, His Holy Mother, and theapostolic college, by employing and conversing in it, butthe ancient one of Babylon, in which these aforesaid bookswere written, as well as a large portion of the Targum,which is the Chaldean Paraphrase of Jonas and Onkelos.It is true to say that the common Syriac draws from thisits origin, but greatly declining from its beginning, asIn the prologue on Tobias the saintoccurs in the others.tells us that, when he made the translation, some one wouldtranslate the words into Hebrew, and from Hebrew heIn the prologuehimself would then turn them into Latin.445446THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEon Daniel, St. Jerome enlarges on the labour that this costhim, and expresses himself in these terms: “You mustknow that Daniel, more especially, and Esdras, and a partof Jeremias, although written in Hebrew characters, yetare in the Chaldean tongue.Job also bears a greatsimilarity to the Aramaic language. When I was a youth,after lessons on Quinctilian and Cicero, and the study of theflowers of rhetoric, I would withdraw to pursue the study ofthe Hebrew tongue, and it was only after many days of greatlabour that I barely attained to sound the words, whichhave to be uttered with clenched teeth and gasping efforts,like one who proceeds along a darksome cave, and just inthe far distance merely descries a tiny gleam of light. Atlength I fell upon Daniel, and then came over me suchgreat despondency and sorrow that, assailed by a suddendespair, I felt impelled to throw up the work and lose theBut I was admonished by a Jewfruit of my past labours.not to do so, and oftentimes did he tell me in his Hebrewtongue: Continued labour overcomes everything; I, then,who among the Hebrews believed I knew something,became a student of the Chaldean. And I will state thetruth, even to this day I read and understand it better thanI can pronounce it.I have stated all this that you mayunderstand the great difficulty that Daniel presented.”From thisI infer that the saint had studied theChaldean language in his early years when in the desert;although he studied it when already advanced in theknowledge of Hebrew, and thus it has to be done, sinceHebrew is, as it were, the principle of the other.Among the other great treasures which Jerome bequeathed to the Church (besides many others which timehas consumed) there are three existing still, which werethe fruits of these labours in the aforesaid languages.The first is On the Hebraic Questions, or Hebrew TranslaTRANSLATIONS FROM THE HEBREW447tions.In this work he tries to manifest the variations inthe translation which in his time was called the Vulgate,that is to say, of the Septuagint, in the manner alreadystated by me, and which we shall also see from his ownwords, from the Hebrew text, and afterwards arrange thediscordance and unravel the difficulties which result fromthis difference.Let us listen to his own version.In the proem to thisbook of his he says as follows: “I earnestly beseech thereader (should there be any one to read this with pleasure)not to seek in the books On the Hebraic Questions, which Ihave attempted to write on all the sacred text, eleganciesnor subtlety of oratory, but rather to give answer for me tomy adversaries to pardon in this the novelty of the work.”Then farther on he adds: “What I pretend in this is toundo the errors of those who think that in the Hebrew textthere is a variation as regards what is less clear and perfectin the Latin and Greek books, and to reduce it to its nativepurity, and declare in passing the etymology of the thingsand of the names of the regions which in our own tonguedo not sound as in the original, and their reason in the Latinlanguage; and to the end that with greater facility theseemendations be made known, I will set the testimonies themselves first, as we now read them, so that by collating themwith what follows it may be manifestly seen what exists, whatmay be more or what is wanting, or what is stated differently.I do not thereby mean, as the envious might allege, that Ipretend to reprehend the seventy interpreters for theirerrors, nor think that this work of mine is a reproofnot wish to reveal theon theirs, because they didsacraments and mysteries of the sacred Scriptures to KingPtolemy of Alexandria, more especially on what touchedand was promised by the coming of Christ: so that itshould not appear that the Jew worshipped a different god.448THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEThis was the reason that Ptolemy held the Jews in suchhigh esteem, in which, as a follower of the doctrine ofPlato, he maintained and believed in one only God.”This was the first work of our saint. Of this sacredmonument there has remained nought in the works of St.Jerome but the questions on the book of Genesis, and thoseof the First Book of Kings, and part of the Third Book.Respecting these and those of the Chronicles, a suspicionexists that they are not the same as those he wrote, but somequestions gathered from his own by some person who hadmade them his study. This suspicion is well founded, becausethey lack that measure of diligence observed in the first,and the frequent quotation from the Septuagint, whichwas the foundation for what was assumed, and the othertranslations of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotian.Nevertheless, they partake very much of the gravity anddoctrine of the saint, and undoubtedly they came forth fromhis study, and as such they are held by all learned men.The second of these works, and the result of his studyof languages, is the one bearing the title of Hebrew Places,"which is in effect the catalogue of the names of cities,towns, castles, mountains, vineyards, rivers, and otherparticular places contained in the sacred books.In thiswork he imitates Eusebius Pamphilius, and takes manythings from him, while leaving others aside: changingsome and obliterating others: sometimes he translates,and at other times he comes forth like a new author.Undoubtedly it is genuinely a work of vast erudition, ofdeep knowledge and great fund of information of ancientIn those days there existed relics ofthings and of history.good books, and many were entire, of which at the presentday we barely even know the names.Following these studies came a third, of no less utility1 De locis Hebraicis.TRANSLATIONS FROM THE HEBREW449or showing less genius.This was the interpretation of theHebrew names mentioned in the whole of the sacredScriptures, a study which has been of great profit to allI recall to mind havingauthors, whether Greek or Latin.mentioned above that proper names inthe Hebrewgenerally enclose some mystery, and are given by divinecounsel, hence, for this reason, the Fathers of the Churchhave drawn many holy considerations, and been able todeclare many difficult passages of the holy Scriptures,which, without a perfect knowledge of names and theiretymology, it would have been impossible to elucidate.And here it would seem a fit occasion to discuss again theantiquity of the Hebrew language, which, with great force,is manifested to us to have been the first language spokenby men in the world, and the one in use at the Deluge; infact the only one down to the time of the Tower of Babel.God punished the pride of men, who, with one spirit and onelanguage, pretended to make their names eternal beforedividing themselves throughout the breadth of the lands,and leave there a monument of the vanity of their inheritance and antiquity.In order to rend to shreds this vaincounsel, God confounded their tongue and the speech,and thus they lost their native language, which is, as hasbeen said, the one that remained with the Canaanites, andwhich, later on, was called the Hebrew. And the reasonis the one we have touched upon in the interpretaBecause if, as we have seen, all, or nearlytion of names.all, the proper names in the sacred Scriptures, which arewritten in the Hebrew tongue, or in that of Canaan (as wehave them even at present), and have always been so, weretaken from the verbs of that language, and are the same asGod had given to the first men and the patriarchs,as is proved by deductions and etymologies which theyalluded to at the time they were given, and as these do not2 G45oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEcorrespond to any other tongue, it is evident that it wasthat tongue they used and the same they spoke.The examples and the observations by which this has tobe proved are without number: they are, in truth, nearly allthe names in the divine letters, a reason being given forconferring the name, why it was called so, or why such aname was given, whether by God himself, or whether byman. Thus it is seen in the naming of Adam, of Eve, ofCain and Abel, Cham, Noe, Abraham, Sara and so forth :and it stands to reason that in conferring a name whichshould bear a signification to some event or intention, itwould be very unlikely to seek for it in a strange tongue,but rather in its own and generally known one, so that allshould understand.St. Jerome was not satisfied with solely giving us theinterpretation of the Hebrew and Chaldean names of theOld Testament; but he also examined all the Greek ones,and even the Arabic and Syriac ones of the New Testament.By these three pious and erudite monuments did St.Jerome enrich us, and with some lofty principles for ouradvantage and profit, if we would wish to imitate him inthe study and knowledge of the sacred scriptures, a taskof so much importance for the advancement of such as meritI cannot imagine how any one canthe name of Christian.boast of being a Christian, and a religious, who, drawn toother books, which are so far different from this one, profitHence our greatin what the name of Christian demands.doctor hazards to say that he who knows not the Scripturesknows not Christ.And, forasmuch as one of my principalmotives for thus writing the history of this great Father hasbeen to induce in members of the religious orders the studyof the holy Scriptures, through following his example andhis doctrine, I wish to bring forward here a passage of hiswhich may suffice to convince the understanding, and drawTRANSLATIONS FROM THE HEBREW451In the preface of histo this love the most obstinate will.Commentaries upon Isaiah he addresses thus the holy virginEustochium: “I wish to repay you the debt and satisfy theobligation in obedience to the precept of Christ which ordersus to search the Scriptures, and in another place says: Seekand you shall find: so that I should not have to bear thereproach addressed to the Jews by Him: You err becauseyou know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God.Henceif, according to the apostle St. Paul, Christ is the power ofGod, and the Wisdom of God, and he who knows not theScriptures neither knows nor understands the power ofGod, nor His Wisdom, by a legitimate consequence it istrue to say, and deduce, that to know not the Scriptures isto know not Christ.”In another preface he says: “If there is any thing thatcould detain in this life a wise man, as a thing which keepshim in peace and even spirit in the midst of so manystorms and great changes, in my opinion the principal andfirst reason is the meditation and knowledge of the sacredScriptures. Because, as the important point in which we differfrom the brute creation is our being rational and having thepower of speech, and, whereas all reason and expressionis contained in these divine books, by means of which welearn what God is, and we comprehend the reason why wewere created, I marvel greatly that there should be any onewho, either through being given up to sleep, to listlessness,or to idleness, does not care to engage himself in the studyof great things, or who dares to reprehend those who areUnder these two most efficaciousengaged in doing so.”reasons has our Jerome concluded that—he who shoulddesire to know what Christ is, Who is our only good, andour very life, he must know this virtue and wisdom, whichcomes from God, and he who should wish to pass overwith even mind and large heart the changes, the roaring452THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwaves, and the deeply dangerous encounters of this world,let him seek to study, meditate, and ponder over thesacred Scriptures. And lastly, he who should desire toknow the only one thing that there is to know—the eternalword, the science, which knows no change, the reasonswhich exceed all reason, let him deliver up his soul to thedivine books, since in no other place is it found but inthem: here is the source found, here it is we drink fromthe actual fountain.Our grave doctor concludes this great EpistletoPaulinus by expressing himself in these words: “I beseechyou, dearly loved brother, let your life be no other thanthis, think of nothing else; do not desire to know anyDoes it not seem thatother thing, nor seek aught else.here below on earth you already enjoy the mansions ofheaven?” Oh! how well does the saint express what hisBecause in the same way as there is nosoul experienced !creature who more vividly tells us what God is, nor amore clear mirror upon which to gaze upon Him than Hisown written word, so also is there no one thing for thefriends of God—after God Himself—in which they canrecreate themselves and feel so much joy as in His ownwords. The delight they experience in this exceeds allelse created: it partakes of the fragrance of the celestiallife: for a man to understand it, and it to be understood byman, is a pleasure which is not known but by the man whopossesses it, and, what is more admirable (a thing whichdoes not occur in any other created science), is that, whenonce it is possessed, it is so thoroughly known that he retainsneither suspicion nor opinion.1 Epist. 103.DISCOURSE THE FOURTHSt. Jerome diligently visits the whole of the Holy Land,with the object of understanding the Chronicles, andother books of the Sacred Scriptures.WoRDS fail, and all eloquence is dumb to praise thediligence of this great Father in collecting treasures withwhich to enrich the Church.Shortly after his return fromvisiting Alexandria, or, as he himself expresses it, from theschool of Didymus, his friends Damian and Rogatianimportuned him to begin to translate the book which inGreek is styled Paralipomenon, and in Hebrew Dibrehaiamin, which in our vernacular is expressed by Words orThings of the Days; and if we carry the word to its fullestsignification means the things, the deeds and the events.This book is, so to say, an epitome or compendium of thewhole of the sacred Scriptures from the beginning ofGenesis to the said book itself, for itis thus that St.Jerome interprets the Greek word Paralipomenon; othersdeclare it to be Psaltermissorum, that is to say, of thethings which were not narrated, or that were passed over ina brief manner in the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Samuel,For this does the same doctor declare in theand Kings.Epistle to Paulinus, that this book is of such great importance that he who thinks that without it he can understandEpist. 103.453454THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe Scriptures is deceived; because in each word and inevery arrangement of name is declared many things whichin the Book of Kings were not declared, and by it manyInquestions of the New Testament are investigated.order to undertake this labour and succeed in it, he wasminded to attempt another work necessary for this end, asotherwise it would be impossible rightly to carry out thework, and it could only be done on the faith of his forefathers.And this work was nothing less than to visit, and examinewith his own eyes, the whole tract of Palestine, searchingout all its places, cities, towns, mountains, valleys, rivers,lakes, springs, and, in a word, all that is found mentionedin the province. And so that this study be carried outwith greater security and certitude, he took with him someexperts among the Hebrews, men brought up in the landitself, and experienced and learned in the sacred Scriptures.Because this business of investigating proper names andthings which are of so great antiquity, and moreover subjectto so many changes, due to time, to variations (whether fromthe will of princes or from the fury of the enemies), to theaction of storms, fires, winds, and overflow of waters,which sweep away and destroy all things, cast down, breakup, crush, burn, and submerge, becomes a very difficultmatter, and one which requires, together with the experienceof years and knowledge of letters, a very mature judgmentto carry out.The doctor himself manifests to us both the difficultyand the advantage.Let us hear him in the Epistle whichhe wrote to Damian and Rogatian: “In the same way,”he says, “as those can better understand Greek historieswho have visited Athens, and have understood the third ofthe Agneid of Virgil, who from within have navigated alongEpirus, and passed its promontory, the mountains Acroceraunos, and, reaching to Sicily from thence have arrived toRESEARCHES IN THE HOLY LAND455where the Tiber flows into the sea by the Port of Ostia;so also in like manner will he see more clearly into thesacred Scriptures who has gazed with his own eyes uponJudea, and has considered the remains of the ancientcities, attained to the knowledge of their primitive names,and those into which they have been changed: for thisreason did I set store and took the trouble to visit, togetherwith men who were learned among the Hebrews, the wholeprovince which is constantly mentioned in the ChurchI confess to you, my beloved Damian andof Christ.Rogatian, that I have never trusted to my genius, nor followedmy own opinion in things relating to the divine books;hence, even as regards such things of which I deemed Ihad already obtained safe information, I did not disdain tomake further inquiries, how much more in such things ofwhich I was doubtful. And whereas by your letters youhad pressed me with haste to put into Latin the Book ofthe Chronicles, I obtained the services of a very learnedman among the Hebrews to come to me from the city ofTiberias, who was held by them to be well versed in thelaw.I have conferred with him upon all points touchingthis my purpose, and thus have satisfied myself, and haveattempted the work you have enjoined me to do. I confessopenly to you that this book of names, both in the Greekand in the Latin, is so corrupted and full of mistakes thatit appears rather to be a confused heap of Sarmatian andBut the blame ofbarbarous names than Hebrew ones.this must not be laid on the seventy interpreters, for these,full of the divine Spirit, translated what was true, butmust be laid on the bad copyists, who out of what wastrue drew falsehoods, and oftentimes out of three names,by removing some syllables, abbreviated them, and madeonly one; others, on the contrary, judging the names long,At the end of the prologue heout of one made three."456THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEsays as follows: “He who should feel inclined to reprehendanything of this interpretation, let him first inquire of theHebrews, and consider the question well, and attend to thecoherence of the text and words, and then reprehend, if hewill, and murmur at this my work.”This careful diligence of our doctor was of greatadvantage, because such as are versed in both the sacredand profane histories teach that, without the knowledge ofplaces, their situation, and proper names, both ancient andTwice does themodern, it is like working blindfolded.holy doctor prove having done so, and how in his memoryhe had ever before him the things of that province: this isfound in the two records which have remained to us ofthese journeys, the one being the Epistle to Eustochium"on the life of her mother St. Paula, wherein he shows muchof what there is in the province of Palestine, pointing outin a brief manner what is more noteworthy and moreproper to the office of a good chronologist, and in whichin my opinion none excel him. The other is in one toDardanus,” and this is one of the fullest and gravest epistleswe have of the saint, and wherein he declares the secret ofthe land of promise: what sacrament was enclosed therein,what land it was which in spirit and in truth had beenpromised. He likewise reveals that although the foundation of this history is in fact laid in that material land, yetthe thoughts of God were not limited to it, nor were theso greatly prized promises circumscribed to its limits. Heproves this, because in the sayings of Moses and in theProphets many things are found which do not correspondwith the land, but that they nevertheless reveal, with anadmirable light, that beneath them is hidden heaven andthe divine mystery which is being prepared for us. Tothis purpose he tells us an infinite number of things with1 Etist. 27.Epist. 129.RESEARCHES IN THE HOLY LAND457such subtlety and condensation, that in order to expoundthem much space would be needed.Such as read throughthis lengthy epistle of St. Jerome's will observe that all was afigure of the spiritual things promised to the legitimate sonsof Abraham, children of promise and of faith, not accordingto the flesh. The actual material land was not what wasin truth promised, nor did the thoughts of God end here:it was a figure, not a reality.By figure is called whatis no more than a representation of what has been, andhere the representation comes before the truth. Thus doesSt. Paul teach us" in many passages of his epistles. Theconclusion of the epistle of our great doctor declares thisvery grandly.For this reason does he advert to it, andlays great stress that we should not forget that in themany places in the holy Scriptures where we find referencesto inheritances and riches given to men by God, we shouldnot lay stress on the letter or outward meaning, but thatthe soul should rise to the interior spirit, to the richesby which the soul is made rich, which neither eye hathseen nor ear heard: let us understand by heaven the influence of the Divine favour, and God's gifts communicatedto man; and by the land, human nature; by the fruits, theThis is what David soughtgood works practised by man.to express, when he sings that God blessed the land, andthe land yielded its fruits, and concludes singing, Truth issprung out of the earth, and justice hath looked down fromthe heavens.” And St. Paul understanding well all thesemysteries, and where all these great promises and blessingswere to end, witnessing them fulfilled within himself, andin all those who in truth and in spirit were true Israelites,says, writing to the Ephesians:* Blessed be the God andFather of our Lord /esus Christ, who hath blessed us withspiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. As He chose1I Ad Cor.Psalm lxxxv. 11.Ephes. i. 3, 4.458THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEus in Him before the foundation of the world that we shouldbe holy and unspotted in His sight in charity. How manythings did the doctor of the Gentiles discover to us, didhistory give us leave to state them here, which I know nothow they could be stated in any created language!Butwhat we have taken in this discourse must suffice.I had also intended in this discourse to have followedhis steps, I mean to say, have given a full description ofthe Holy Land, which he visited so much to the purpose,but I felt and judged it would be outside my purpose, andthus decided to omit it.Should any one desire to go intothis more fully, let him seek out Brocardus in the lengthywork he made on this subject.Also Saligniacus broughtout another, Brundembachius took up also the subject, andsubsequently to all these, and in a very exhaustive manner,Christianus Andricornius.In our language [Spanish] thereare likewise several works, nevertheless none have thefinished diction of the one found in the Sacred Scheme ofthe Biblia Regia in the book called Caleó; because thewant of knowledge of the Hebrew language in the authorsI have quoted has been the cause that the native names arenot written with the accuracy of the last-mentioned work.DISCOURSE THE FIFTHSt. Jerome composes a Martyrology.The Reason forwriting Martyrologies in the Church.AMoNG the signal services which the talent of St. Jeromerendered to Holy Church, there was one of no mean importance. This was a martyrology. In substance this means,and was, a brief summary and plain narrative of the life anddeath of martyrs, arranged to suit all days of the year, andwhich from the name of the months was called the Kalendar.The day is stated and the place of their martyrdom, andthe kind of martyrdom they suffered.In the Castilianlanguage very little information is found as to the nature ofmartyrologies, and what foundation and motives there werefor having them. As to the cause which moved our saintto do this work, I am inclined to give here some informaOne characteristic has the life of our saint, as I havetion.observed before, that there is scarcely any one thing in theChurch which has not passed through his hands.I couldvery well have widened the outlines of his history, had Iwished to undertake the investigation of the events of histime, whether they occurred in the affairs of the Church, orin respect to the eastern and western Empires, the RomanState, and the persons who treated with him, giving somedetails of their lives and deaths, but I considered thatthis line was very much used by many, and that I might45946oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEfrom them gather what should be outside my purpose;hence I have withdrawn my hand from what is commonplace, which would make me a sort of preacher, or anThus I haveorator, a thing very distinct from history.chosen to treat upon some particular details of the Church,which should be purely connected with our saint, eitherseeing that they originated with him, or were furtheredby him, or again that he had written concerning them.Now, as I have said, this is one very worthy work to makeknown as being his in the manner we shall see.Theoccasion which gave rise to the fact of writing martyrologies,which in Latin are called Kalendars, by reason that at theheading is given the age of the sun and the moon, was thatin the Roman Church, and in other especial ones, it hadbeen usual, ever since the earliest times of the Church, tomake a remembrance of the saints who had shed theirblood for Christ, or had notably confessed Him with theirlives,in the divine offices celebrated in the churches,more especially in the holy sacrifice of the altar, when, inthe course of the year, came the anniversary of their birthday, for such was it called, the day of their martyrdom(which was in truth the day of their birth to heaven),and the holy sacrifice was offered in their honour and incertaintheir memory.persons in the Church, of keeping a memorial of them, sothat no day should pass unheeded of the martyr or confessor, and thus their feast and memorial be kept. Graveauthors and of great antiquity have left records of thiscustom in their writings.Tertullian, in the book DeCorona Militis, distinctly says, Pro natalitiis annua diefaciemus, which is to say, on their birthdays we shall offersacrifice once a year. The word facere also means to sacrifice, which is a word much used, not only by the ancientLatins, but likewise by the writers of the holy Scriptures.This duty was entrusted toCOMPOSES A MARTYROLOGY461Varro, in his book De Lingua Latina, says: Agnam /oviVirgil, Cumfacit, “He sacrifices a ewe lamb to Jupiter.”Cicero” and Cato, who arefaciam vitulam pro frugibus.princes of the Latin tongue, used the said verb in the samesense; and in the Book of Kings Elias said to the priestsof Baal, Ego faciam bovem alterum; and then, farther down,Eligete bovem unum, et facite primi, from which is clearlyseen that the word facite means “Sacrifice to your god anI have willinglyox, and I will sacrifice another to mine.”drawn attention to this, so that we should in passing comprehend that, when our Redeemer said to His disciples onthe night of the Last Supper, after He had offered thesacrifice of His body to the Father: Hoc facite in meamcommemorationem, not only does He tell them to do whatHe had done, but by the word facite He says, “Sacrifice asI have sacrificed: I have sacrificed Myself to the Father,and you have to celebrate and sacrifice My own real andtrue body and blood”; and the same word did Tertullianemploy, penetrating the same sense, when he said Pronatalitiis annua die faciemus. And the word natalitiis doesnot mean, as the hapless Renan thought, the birth accordingto the Gentile sense, but the day when with glorious triumphthe martyrs were received into heaven.This same custom does St. Cyprian" testify to in an epistleto the clergy of Carthage, where he says as follows: “Takenotice and make a commemoration of the days on which theydied [he speaks of the martyrs], so that we may be ableto celebrate their memories along with those of othermartyrs, notwithstanding that our faithful and most devoutbrother Tertullian, with that care and solicitude he has ofall things, and that he employs in the service of thebrethren (for even in what appertains to the body he never1 Varro, lib. v.3 Cicer. Aro Muren.Virg. Eclog 3.Epist. 37.462THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEforgets), has written to me, and continues to do so, marking the days whereon our blessed brothers have beenin the prisons, and those who have passed with glorioustriumph and death into immortality: here we celebratein their commemoration sacrifices and oblations of suchas presently by the help of the Lord we shall celebratewith you.”In another epistle, he repeats the same: “Let no onethink,” he says, “that these offerings and sacrifices were forthe liberation from the pains of purgatory, as we do for ourdead, because the blood which they shed for Jesus Christdischarged them from all debt, leaving them pure and cleanto enter in and enjoy their seats and crowns of glory.Thisis not to be understood but of the festival days, which, totheir glory and honour, were celebrated as we now celebratethem. To Magdalen Christ said that many sins were forgiven her, because she had loved much; and He also saidthat no man could show greater love than by giving hislife for the beloved; hence it is concluded in truth thatthe martyrs, who gave for their beloved Jesus Christ theirlives, remained after this act and trial well purified andsanctified, without stain, nor had they anything to purge, norfor them was sacrifice made. To this purpose St. Augustine,discoursing on St. John, says:” “Let us remember them[he speaks of the martyrs] upon the table of the altar, sothat they may plead for us, and obtain from God that wemay follow their footsteps, because otherwise it would berather to injure the saints. They have no needs, and weassume them to be needy: we ourselves are the ones whoIn accordance with this usage, theare necessitous.”names of the saints were recited in the mass, and in theirrecitation there came first the Apostles, and then themartyrs, and (according as it is gathered from St. AugustineEpist. 34.Tract 84 et Serm. 17. De Verb Apost.REASONS FOR WRITING MARTYROLOGIES463in the book De Sancta Virginitate)’ other saints followed,although they were not martyrs. And I believe that fromthis remained the custom, as we see, of the names of thesaints being mentioned in the canon of the mass even atthe present day, the Church selecting such as by the impulse of the Holy Ghost were inserted, so as not to makea long list.From this fact of the annotations and memorials ofthe days of the martyrs occasion was taken of writingGreat indeed was the number of martyrsmartyrologies.who died for Christ during the ten greatest persecutions:their names were written down in all the churches, as wellas the days on which they suffered, and even their torments.In those times it was the custom to read out on the eves offestivals their names in the church, as is done now in the calendar, which is read at prime, in order that all should know whatfeast-day was to be celebrated on the following day, and inwhose memory the Sacred Host was to be offered.Therewere also in the churches boards or panels upon which theThese Tertullian calls fasti,list of the saints was written.which were great archives of ecclesiastic and profaneantiquity: thus does he say in the book De Corona Militis:“Habes tuos census, tuos fastos, nihil tibi cum gaudits saculi.You have your days reckoned up, your annual festivals:you have nothing to do with the joys and festivities of theworld.” Thus it is also seen that on the feast-days of themartyrs in those early times the faithful rejoiced, and hadtheir banquets and made a feast.These feasts were calledAgapa, which means days of love and charity, from whichis seen the antiquity of the holy custom still practised inSpain of the people proceeding to the churches dedicatedto the martyrs, and the various hermitages, such as those ofSts. Sebastian, Lawrence, Stephen, and many others, andDe Sancta Virg. cap. 45.464THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthere partaking of some food in sign of rejoicing, and itis said by that “they give charity.”In the Laodicean Council, in canon xxxviii., it wasordained that this be not done within the church. Thusdo we see that many of them at the present day stillretain the porches, around which the invited were gatheredtogether.. The first of whom by common accord we have any noticeas having done anything in the way of martyrologies wasAnd ourEusebius of Caesarea, called also Pamphilius.doctor appears to confirm this as a fact in an epistleascribed to him, which is found among his works, and withhis name, which was sent to Chromatius and Heliodorus, adocument which has however been doubted as being his.It is affirmed also by Bede' in his book on the Acts of theApostles, and by Wilfred Strabo in his work Of the Affairsof the Church, and after him by all modern writers, and ina more especial manner by John Molanus” in his book DeMartyrologio. The above-quoted authors, after declaringEusebius to be the first, make St. Jerome the second.They add that Jerome translated the one written in Greekby Eusebius into Latin; and the actual words of Bede arein the already-mentioned place.Strabo says as follows:“Jerome, following Eusebius of Caesarea, composed themartyrology for the course of the year at the petition ofthe two bishops Chromatius andTheoccasion was when the Emperor Theodosius attendedthe council of the bishops, and then greatly praisedGregory, Bishop of Cordova, because in his daily masshe made a memento and named the martyrs who hadsuffered and died on each day.”These are the very wordsof Strabo, and are taken from the text of the epistlesHeliodorus.Retract. super Act. Apost. cap. 1.Molanus, De Martyr. c. 2.REASONS FOR WRITING MARTYROLOGIES465which are found at the heading of the martyrologies aspreface.The reply to the letter, which is ascribed to St. Jerome,is long, and among many other things says as follows:“When the Emperor Constantine entered the city ofCaesarea, he bade the holy bishop Eusebius of Caesarea askfor what he should judge convenient for the needs of theChurch of his city; and it is written that Eusebius repliedin this wise—My Lord, wealth enough has my Church,therefore I have no need to ask for any favours for her.But for a great length of time I have greatly desired thatwith much solicitude and diligence search be made in thearchives of the audience courts and tribunals not only ofthe city of Rome, but all other places subject to the RomanEmpire, for the processes and causes and suits which hadbeen fulminated by the judges of these and other courtsagainst the saints of the Lord, and what martyrs therewere, and under what princes and judges they were judgedand condemned, in what provinces and cities, on whatdays, and with what perseverance in passion they obtainedthe palm of martyrdom; and that having drawn all thisand written down all these extracts from the said archives,these documents be sent on to me.” He farther on addsin the epistle that Eusebius, as faithful narrator of theseevents, wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, and furthermoresays: “Whereas for each day there are more than 890 namesof martyrs mentioned in the various provinces and cities,so much so that there is no day in the year which has notassigned to it 500, except the first day in January.” And atthe end he says: “In order to prevent the weariness ofso prolix a task, I will recount the chief among them intheir proper dates, as in this small book is contained.”Itsuffices to have quoted the above from this epistle, to seeCassiodorus, in the book On theand gather the truth.2 H466THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEDivine Institutions, says as follows: “Read oftentimes theway of future blessedness; read the lives of the Fathers, theconfessions of the faithful, and the passion of the martyrs,which things among others you will find in the epistlewhich St. Jerome sent to Chromatius and Heliodorus andthose who have flourished throughout the world, in orderthat, encouraged by these, their imitation may carry usto the kingdom of heaven.”From this is seen thegreat antiquity and authority of these epistles, sincethey bear that name and testimony of Cassiodorus andWilfred Strabo, authors of many hundred years back,Cassiodorus having flourished in the year 558.But whereas it appears to many learned men of these times thatthese epistles are not authentic but falsehoods under shamtitles,it is as well to understand the reasons for theirfoundation, which in my judgment are conclusive. As forme, I am convinced after hearing Chromatius, Heliodorus,and Jerome speaking, that these letters are not theirs, inthe same way as in place of a politician and a man of loftymind one were to substitute a barbarian and shepherd boy.”Doubtless such are mistaken who think" that the book Ofthe Martyrs, written by Eusebius of Caesarea, was a briefsummary in the manner of a martyrology, and for thisAs areason they have made him the author of them.proof of this we have no need of any but himself, who sooftentimes mentions this work in his histories, and teachesclearly what it was, and what he did. The case was intruth this, according to a very probable conjecture, thatSt. Jerome read these books of Eusebius, and out of themmade a brief summary, recapitulating the points and thesubstance, and this he sent to the two bishops, ChromatiusCassiod.

And from this is concluded that St.Jerome was the first who set, in form and style themartyrologies, at least in the churches of the last named.Gelasius refers in the Roman Council that it was notpermitted in the Church of Rome for histories concerning the martyrs to be read, as had been up to that timethe custom; because, owing to the impious and crueledicts of Diocletian, the most precious relics which theworld contained, were consigned to the fire, ordering withfurious hate the books of the Christians to be burnt.Thisis recounted by Eusebius in lib. viii., by Arnobius, Optatus,and others.Nevertheless, some tables and minutes remained, which had been concealed, or were passed overunnoticed, and some portions which devout persons hadpreserved secretly, some through devotion, and others fromholy curiosity, and thus out of these relics was re-formedand continued the martyrology, which bears the same stampof antiquity as the commencement of the Church itself, forit came from the time of St. Clement, the disciple ofSt. Peter.In course of time this was enriched from St. Jerome'sday, our great doctor, up to the present time, by the diliHence this isgence of learned men, pious and saintly.one of the principal things we have to thank St. Jerome for,as appears on the authority of Cassiodorus, above quoted,which is very weighty; and if to this we add that of St.Gregory, Pope,” it suffices to render it perfectly confirmed.Bishop ofAlexandria, he says as follows: “We have nearly all thenames of the martyrs with their individual passions andmartyrdoms for each one of the days collected together inone volume, and we celebrate their memories in the officeof the mass; but we have not the statements in this bookIn an epistle he wrote toEulogius,1 Lib. viii. 2.Grego. lib. vii., Epist. indicion. 1, Epist. 29.468THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEof the kind of martyrdom each endured, but only the placeand the day of their passion, and, as I have said, weknow each day how many saints in various lands andprovinces were crowned with the diadem of martyrdom;yet I think that your beatitude possesses the same therein your Church.” From these words we learn from St.Gregory that this book of the martyrology had been spreadthroughout the Church, since he holds it as certain that itexisted in Alexandria, and that from it various transcriptshad been taken, which had become dispersed throughoutthe world, and, since there exists no proof of any author,either remote or modern, having done this but St. Jerome,I mean, set in form and curtailed to an epilogue of daysof the week, it is seen clearly that it was this which theholy doctor Jerome sent from the east to Italy, althoughsubsequently there were additions made and revised andimproved, which was easy to do, after the initial work wasdone, for each Church to add its saints.Later on wereadded not only martyrs, but also holy doctors, confessors,and virgins. Thus it increased to such a degree that eachChurch had its own martyrology, from which arose alsothat the office was much varied, so as to give admittanceto their particular feasts.At least we must say that,although it was in Rome that these martyrologies hadtheir birth, and their commencement due to the care andsolicitude of popes and notaries, the form and the mannerfollowed is that of St. Jerome throughout the Church, andtogether with this he enriched it with what he sent to beadded from the labours of Eusebius to those great ones existAt the present day thising which were already in Rome.martyrology is dispersed about, and known under the jointtitles of St. Jerome and Eusebius, although I doubt notbut that it is so disfigured and altered that the sainthimself would not recognise it, and I am of opinion thatREASONS FOR WRITING MARTYROLOGIES469the judgment of Molanus is in part true that this martyrologyis the one composed by Usuardus at the petition ofCharlemagne, joining it to all that came to hand from St.Such as would wish toJerome, Bede, Florus, and others.know more in detail respecting this question will do well toread this author in the part quoted, and Cardinal CaesarBaronius in his Commentaries on the Martyrologies.DISCOURSE THE SIXTHOf the many Treatises and Epistles which St. Jerome wroteat the Petition of various Persons whilst in Bethlehem.LIKE to a new sun did St. Jerome shine forth from thecave of Bethlehem, where he had established his dwelling,close to that humble crib upon which had been laid thewealth of the heavens. To Jerome resorted all such asdesired their salvation, and such as were yearning to put offHe was assailed by some with letters,their ignorance.and by others to see him, and to be taught by his voice.Such as could not come, either by reason of distance, or onaccount of their duties and the offices they filled, or fromtheir state in life, ceased not to importune him with letters,and craved from him solutions of difficulties and questions,and expositions of texts from the holy Scriptures.Almighty God awakened these desires in the souls ofmany persons, in order that His servant Jerome should beroused from the sleep of contemplation and his ownindividual bent of life, enclosed and humble, to the generalgood of the Church; because He had not set so brilliant alight in that spot for it to be hidden and take pleasure toBefore proceeding farther I wish to observeitself alone.one thing, and that is to make known the deep humility ofthis man at once so saintly and so learned that he neverpublic, neither when a priestattempted to preach in47oWRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM47 Iin Antioch nor when a cardinal at Rome, nor even whenlater on he dwelt in Bethlehem.I know not with what words to qualify our own audacityin preaching when–I will not say we have not theknowledge he had or his sanctity either, but when we aretotally ignorant and our own lives so ordinary and so listless,yet we pretend to do so with such boldness, and set ourselvesin the pulpit of Christ with such little sufficiency, yet asconfidently as though we knew more than Jerome: westand forth there bereft of good theology, ignorant of theholy Scriptures, without knowledge of languages—I donot say of Greek and Hebrew, but of Latin—and even of ournative tongue, without having studied the art of speakingwell, but merely having studied a few folios purchased atthe shops we fill the churches with our voices, we thunderforth from the pulpits, and even carry the people after us!St. Jerome, his mind and soul full of all that is deficientin us, yet never dared to ascend the pulpit!Great indeedwas his humility, as great as is our vanity; indeed I think II only find that St. Jerome wrotecannot exaggerate it.thirty-nine homilies on St. Luke (lost to our sorrow is thisgreat treasure!), for although homilia means colloquium, orreasoning made in the congregation, there is no proof that hedelivered them in public, I mean to say in any city or town:possibly he may have delivered them to his monks in themonastery of Bethlehem. He mentions these homilies inthe catalogue De viris illustribus, placing them at the end ofall, and, counting the works he had written down to thatdate, which was the fourteenth year of the Empire of Theodosius, and of our Lord 392. What marvel that he shouldhesitate at preaching who had not dared to approach the altaras a priest, and with equal humility also hesitated to write,and all that we have of his was drawn out at the sheer pleadings of friends and saintly persons, that is to say, these books472THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwere births and offsprings of the spirit of humility deeplyrooted, which were brought forth at the power of prayer andmeditation! What marvel that from these roots should comebranches which should reach heaven, and that the birds ofloftiest flight should come and rest upon them?Evagrius, alearned man and a great friend of Jerome's, besought himfrom Antioch to write down his opinion in regard toMelchisedech, forasmuch as some held that he was theHoly Ghost, and others that he was an angel, or of othernature superior to man.Jerome replied destroying thiserror, and proves it by drawing forth the Hebrew origin,which says he was like the rest of men, a pure man, and,according to the sentence of some Hebrews he was said tobe Sem, the first-born of father Noe, and who at the timehe blessed Abraham was of the age of 390, and many otherthings does he teach in this epistle to his great friendEvagrius. And whereas there arises an occasion of speaking of this holy man, it is well to observe here that therewere two men called Evagrius. One at Antioch, holy andpious, the friend of Jerome, who through his merits came tobe bishop of that city, after the death of Paulinus, and itwas this one to whom he addressed the reply respectingMelchisedech. The other was Ponticus Hyperborites, atone time the disciple of St. Gregory Nazianzen, andDeacon of Constantinople.He greatly favoured theerrors of Origen, and was the great friend of Palladius,Rufinus, and of Melania, and not content with followingso evil a doctrine invented another novel one, and otherthings, which any one desirous of further knowledge mayread in Jerome's Epistle to Tesiphontes.Therefore thisEvagrius is not to be confounded with Evagrius the friendof Jerome.Fabiola had besought of Jerome the explanation of theEpist. 126.WRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM473forty-two mansions, and, whereas he had been unable tosatisfy her pleadings during her lifetime, he consecrated thislabour to her memory after her death, being then inFabiola likewise requested him to declare theBethlehem.sacerdotal vesture of the old synagogue. He did so, and,in order to grasp better the subject, he commences with themost important of the ancient sacrifices, and declares firstthe sense of the letter and history, as he did in the exposition of the mansions; secondly, the spirit and the truth.In these treatises St. Jerome joins together brevity andelegance, and with such skill that I venture to say he faroutshone all writers, whether ancient or modern—there isno word which he might have suppressed, no negligence,or a single word without its mystery. What he says ofothers perfectly fits him in a higher degree, so that such asbecome converted to the Lord with ease can remove theveil from the countenance of Moses, because as His law isspiritual, and He is a Spirit, so does the letter diewhich kills, and the Spirit rises up that gives life.AsDavid asked, when he said: “Lord, clean my eyes, removethe veil from them, and I will consider the marvels of ThyLaw."it teaches muchin a few sentences; adding to it another epistle he wroteto Marcella, who had asked him from Rome to declarewhat thing was the Ephod-bad and what the Teraphim,there will be found a complete definition of what appertainsto these sacerdotal vestures and ornaments, and the sacredceremonies; in the book called Aaron will be found whathere might not be so clear. To the same Marcella healso declares in another epistle” the ten divine nameswhich are found in the Hebrew, while in another epistle hedeclares to her what is meant by the Greek Diapsalmonand the Hebrew Sela, which is so frequently used in theThis is indeed a singular epistle,Epist. 128.Epist. 130.3In Biblia Regia.g:Epist. 136.£474THE LIFE OF ST.

JEROMEand to them. He benignly gives and delivers His gifts. Tothis purpose does Jerome tell them at the beginning of theepistle, in loving and courteous words, how rejoiced he hadbeen to find women of so warlike a people placed insuch occupation, and with so earnest a desire, that fromGermany they should send to Syria such questions to beFrom this is also inferred the great renown ofdefined.St. Jerome, a poor monk enclosed in a cell of Bethlehem,yet sought out from the remotest parts of the world byHedibia and Algasia do likewise frommen and women.France: they sent messengers and proposed questions ofimportance. These are replied to, and thus Jerome deliversout of their difficulties all who resort to him.Paulinusthe priest also importuned him with other grave questions.And in order to avoid any mistake in reference to thePaulinus of whom in the course of this history we havehad occasion to mention (and in the epistles and writingsof our saint there are found various works), it must beadverted that the first Paulinus was Bishop of Antioch, andthe one who ordained our saint, and came with him toRome: the same who had the disputes with Meletius, andwho was succeeded after his death by Evagrius.Another,the second Paulinus, was a great Roman senator, consulgeneral by reason of his great virtue and prudence; he wasthe disciple of Ausonius, a celebrated poet, and who subsequently left all things and, contemning the things of theworld, and even poetry itself and other elegant studies,was minded to enter the monastic life.He consultedwith Jerome on the spot to be selected by letters, becausehe had formed the intention of coming with him to theHoly Land, and the saint dissuaded him from it; for hefully realised the great advantage it would be for Italy thathe should remain and exercise there his authority. OnEpist. 150 and 151.WRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM477this subject Jerome wrote to him a very learned andeloquent epistle, in which he gives him the rule of life ina monastic order as to its chief points, and persuades him toundertake the study of the holy Scriptures because heFor this same individualhimself had an elegant style.in an another epistle” two questionsJerome declaresAt last this Paulinus becamewhich he had proposed.Nola, so lauded bythe renowned great Bishop ofQuite distinctSt. Augustine and other learned doctors.from either of these was the third Paulinus, to whomJerome addressed, the celebrated epistle which is foundat the beginning of the Bible, wherein he persuades himto come to the Holy Land, contrariwise to what he hadurged the other Paulinus,” whence is seen that they weredifferent men, although some seem to think they were thesame; but they are in error, since they fail to perceivethat these two epistles advise contrary things—one that heshould not come to the Holy Land, and the other to come,both individuals being at the proper age to choose the lifeThis is in brief the history of theor state to be followed.various Paulinus, so that we should make no mistake.Ina word, wheresoever there were learned men, whereverthere were good desires and grave affairs and questions tobe treated upon in Rome, in Egypt, Germany, Africa,France, or Spain in respect to the sacred Scriptures, orany difficulty arose, the solution or remedy was to seekJerome, and resort to the cave of Bethlehem for the foodof doctrine, which was the bread Jeremiah wept over,because there was no one to break it for the little ones!In order to see the activity, the crowd of things, whichcame to Bethlehem, and the labours that were therebyimposed upon the saintly doctor to carry through, let ushear his confession, drawn from him, so to say, under1 Epist. 13.Epist. 153.Marian, in argument, Epist. 103.478THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEtorture.Writing to the second Paulinus above mentioned,in the aforequoted epistle, he says as follows at thecommencement: “With loud voice you awaken me towrite, and with your own eloquence you terrify me, for inthe diction you employ in your epistles you represent me tobe a Cicero. You complain to me that I only send youThis does notlittle short epistles written carelessly.proceed from negligence, but from the fear you haveinspired in me, for, did I send you many words, you wouldfind much to correct, and, to tell you the simple truth, inthis shipload which is being prepared now to forward tothe West I have been demanded so many replies to lettersthat, were I to reply to all that I am asked for, I shouldfind it impossible to satisfy; therefore I strive—puttingaside elegance and good diction, as well as the desires ofsuch as address me—to reply just what first occurs to me.And, when I send you my letters, I do it not consideringyou as a judge, but as a friend.” Of this pressure of workand frequent calls upon his time and genius does JeromeI omit to mention many othercomplain in many places.epistles and treatises forwarded to many persons on variousand difficult matters.Amid many other things which are marvels that wediscover in the life of this great doctor, one thing indeedwhich commands our deep consideration is to observe howhe speaks to and measures swords with all classes, popes,monks, priests, consuls, senators, virgins, widows, andmarried people; yet to each one he is fully able to replyand advise; with all propriety and keeping decorum, he investigates and penetrates each case, and lucidly advises, asthough in each state he had been well exercised in itsoffice and foreseen its aims.This qualification is alsoobserved in other holy doctors, because God has set themas beacons and lights, to illumine such as do not know soWRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM479much ; but in no one with such brilliancy as in Jerome.Whoever considers and witnesses how he speaks withmarried people—a state absolutely different to his own .—and should listen to his advice, rules, documents forthe family, children, servants, the plan and the arrangementof the household, and how notwithstanding all these dutiesthey can have recourse to prayer at proper times andpractise the exercise of pious works, he would be inclined tobelieve that he himself had been a married man all his life.On the other hand, when we find him revealing the maliceand wretched dealings of priests, the omissions of thebishops, the negligences of the monks, the bold ways ofwidows, and the freedom of single women, there is no onebut would be fain to say he had been watching them, or thathe had a familiar spirit which revealed and discovered allthis to him.But it was naught else but that God dealttowards him in the manner He had done in other timeswith His prophets when He wished to reprehend andpunish the evil customs of His people. God would instilinto him, as He had done into them, terms and words sovivid, so significant of vice and malice, that it would seemthey were in the midst of it all.For instance, who taughtIsaias to name, and mention in detail, with such significantexpressions the decking-out and manners of the worldlydressed-up women and lovers of Israel as he depicts themin every point ?Similarly does God act now, and alwayshas done, in the Church with His saintly preachers! Whothat would behold Chrysostom, Basil, Gregory, Bernard,and others revealing the malice and the evil doings of allthe states of life we have already mentioned—a thing theythemselves were very far from following—but would haveto admit that this language was not learned in the ordinaryway? Many preachers of our time vaunt loudly that theyLet us hopecould do the same very vividly themselves.48oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEin God that these latter have not acquired this knowledgeby other paths than that one followed by the saints!Forthe effects do not appear to be the same. As we wereproceeding to speak of the occupations and the haste thatwas forced on Jerome that he had barely time to reply tothe demands upon him, despite that his facility in doingso and his promptitude was very great, hence they werealways ahead of him, who could believe that a mancould be found of such skill as to be able to translate inthree days from Hebrew into Latin the books of Solomon—Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Canticles? To be able toread them simply within this time is a great deal.YetJerome himself affirms that he did so.Let us hear himin the Epistle to Chromatius and Heliodorus, to whomhe addresses the preface to these books.“Let the letterbe joined to such as are united in the priesthood, or, ratherbetter said, do not divide the epistle among those whoare gathered together by the love of Christ. The Commentaries on Osee, Amos, Zacharias, and Malachias whichyou have asked me for, I would willingly write, did mysickness permit.Send me assistance for the cost, andsupport my copyist, in order that my genius and penmay be principally employed in your service; but I amsurrounded by those who demand many things, as thoughit were just that I should labour for others when youyourselves are in need, or in a question of obligation andof contract I should deem myself the debtor of any othersbut yourselves.Hence, although broken in health by along illness, yet so that the whole year be not passed insilence and dumbness towards you, I have dedicated in yourname a labour of only three days, which was the translationof three books of Solomon—Miste, which the Hebrewscall parables, and in the vulgate translation Proverös;Aoheleth, which the Greeks call Ecclesiastes, and we inWRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM481Latin call Concionator; and Sir of Sirin, which in ourvernacular means Canticle of Canticles.”Despite that this quickness of translation reveals greatfacility and knowledge of both languages, and a deepcomprehension of the holy Scriptures, I think what hedid at the request of his disciple Eusebius of Cremonafar more wonderful. He was bound to proceed to Italy,but he did not wish to start without some gift from hismaster; hence Eusebius begged Jerome to give him somedeclaration on St. Matthew, and he so prevailed uponhim that in the space of a fortnight (a thing almostincredible) he wrote the Commentaries which are in theChurch and are read with so much profit; and forasmuch as the preface written by the master himself to hisdisciple affords us a testimony of this statement and is veryerudite, I wish to insert here some part.It commencesthus: “Whereas many set store on arranging the historyof those things, which we see fulfilled in ourselves, according as we are told by those who from the commencementsaw them and were ministers of the said word; and themonuments and relics which up to, the present havecontinued and been explained, because being composed byvarious authors were the beginnings of divers sects, suchas is the gospel called by the Egyptian that of St. Thomas,St. Matthias, of St. Bartholomew, and, lastly of all, of theTwelve Apostles; that of Basilides and Apelles, and ofmany more, which would be too long to count; and itsuffices to say at present of all of them that there weresome who without the Spirit of God and without His gracewearied themselves rather to arrange and weave out talesthan to write a true history, to which fits well the wordsof the prophet: ‘Alas! for those who prophesy out of theirheads, and walk according to their own spirit, and say,The Lord saith and the Lord did not send them.’”2 I482THE LIFE OF ST.

Few indeed were the yearsthat his emaciated body was not attacked by sicknessand tried in many other ways: hair shirts, fastings, chains,lengthened prayer, and the exercise he imposed uponhimself between times of washing the feet of all who insuch numbers resorted to him.I surmise that it was from here that our saintly doctorwrote what he did on the Canticles of Solomon, this literarytreasure having been lost to us together with many otherIn the catalogue of his works he mentions twowritings.homilies on the Canticles. Some assert that these werewhat he transcribed from Origen, although when it is nomore than a transcript he always mentions the fact, asmay be observed in that same catalogue; hence I aminclined to believe that both these homilies were his own,and that at the time he had written no others, for, as wehave seen, this was in the fourteenth year of the EmpireWRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM485of Theodosius, and subsequently, as he lived a long life, hemight have finished the rest. And in passing I will saywhat I think in regard to the Commentaries which arescattered about mixed with his works on St. Mark, andwhat is the opinion of such as have investigated this well.All students are at one who have studied the diction of St.Jerome, that these Commentaries are not his, but that theywere engrafted on his works many years ago.This theyprove by many reasons; and the first, let it be the obviousone, the great difference which exists in the language, forwe can never admit that a learned man and one so wisecan forget his manner of speaking, and should change it sounwarrantably from his usual style of writing that it shouldappear as that of another man. He who should not feelthis must needs know little, and not understand whatdifference there is between the manner of expressinghimself of a learned man and that of one who is not.The style of the man who wrote these Commentaries is ofone who only knew Latin fairly well, Greek very little, andHebrew not at all; therefore, how could St. Jerome soaltogether forget his learning ? Even should he have doneit on purpose, he would have been betrayed in many places.Moreover, St. Jerome, albeit he at times did not care to beso very polished as his diction usually was, yet he is carefulnever to appear either as a barbarian or as an ignoramus,much of which is to be found in this exposition of St. Mark,things most unworthy to be attributed to so polished anintellect and judgment as was that of St. Jerome.Nevercould St. Jerome say, although he should speak in his sleep,that Pascha signifies transitus, and Phase signifies immolatio,as says the author of these Commentaries on Chapter XIV.And that Mardum Pisticam is the same as Misticam. TheseCommentaries also have many sentences extremely contraryto those of the saintly doctor; and what is more noteworthy,486THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEin Chapter XV. there are quoted fragments of versesof Sedulius on the form of the Cross.Sedulius is laterthan our doctor by some years, since it is hardly possiblethat at the time of Jerome's death he should have been born,which was about the year 430.In Chapter XV. he affirmsthat St. Mark says correctly that Christ was crucified atthe hour of Terce, because at the hour of Sext, so greatwas the darkness that the Jews were unable to read thetitle on the Cross.In this manner there are a hundredother things; thus I have no doubt that these Commentarieswere not his, nor indeed would Jerome gain anything bytheir being attributed to him, except with such personsas deem more the quantity of books than that they shouldbe good, and well and carefully finished; as though worksof greatness of spirit and objects of genius should begiven out by weight and cart-loads.Jerome about thistime wrote many other things, and we know that in theyear above stated, after the birth of the Saviour 392, and thefourteenth of Theodosius, he had written a Chronicon ofUniversal History: it was called Chronicon in Greek, aswe should say annales, relating in brief the events accordingto the course of time by the consecutive years, keepinggreat precision, which is the soul of history.In this workhe makes no reference to the history he translated ofEusebius of Caesarea from Greek into Latin, yet it is certainhe did do so during the reigns of the Emperors Theodosiusand Gratian, as is proved by himself in a preface he set tothis very translation. And to avoid any mistakes, it mustbe observed that this Chronicon of Universal History ofEusebius is not the work in ten volumes which now iscalled the Ecclesiastical History, because these were translated by Rufinus of Aquileia, but the Chronica Universalia;and, in order to see the truth of this, and what it wasthat the holy doctor did in this work, let us hear his ownWRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM487actthetimesthis work Iwords in the preface.“Let it be noticed,” he says,“that inoffice ofatinterpreter,at others of author, because sometimes Itranslate the Greek faithfully, at other times I add what Ijudge be wanting, more especially in the Historia Romana,which Eusebius wrote, who was the author of this work,not because he was ignorant (for he was very erudite),but because, as he wrote the Greek version, he judged it waslittle to the purpose. So much was this the case that fromNinus and Abraham to the Fall of Troy it is no more than atranslation of Greek into Latin; and from the Fall of Troydown to the twentieth year of the reign of Constantine Imore often added, and at other times mingled, what I drewfrom Tranquillus and other illustrious historians with allprecision.From the aforesaid date down to the consulshipsof Augustus, of Valens VI., and Valentinian the Second,I deemed best to end here, reserving theall is my own.later times of Gratian and Theodosius to form a largerhistory.Not that I had any fear of writing of the livingfreely and truly (may the fear of God cast out that of man!),but because, owing to the fury of the barbarians which isdisturbing the whole earth, all things are in an uncertainAll this isstate, without knowing how things will end.”Jerome's.And in the epistle" on the right way of interpretingwhich he writes to Pammachius, he openly confesses thesame, and brings forward this very preface to Eusebius,and mentions some words from it.Daniel” hequotes the Chronicon of Eusebius, translated by himself.Let it be observed here by the diligent student of historythat the Chronicon of Eusebius and Jerome, which now isin circulation, is very distinct from the one made by thesetwo most grave authors: the negligence of the copyistsInEpist.

To them no door was closed:he could deny them nothing. They drew from him allthey desired, and they owed him everything. The saintacknowledges this by the laws of gratitude. They werefellow-workers, inseparable in his life and studies: allthings he judged little which he could do at their pleading.A few days after his return from the companionship ofDidymus of Alexandria, at the petition of both these holywomen, he wrote the Commentary on the Epistle to theGalatians in three volumes.Later on upon the Epistle tothe Ephesians, three other books. Upon the Epistle toTitus, and upon that to Philemon, as many more.The prefaces which he wrote to each of these booksare most delightful, of great erudition, and of equal profit.It seems to me such a pity to pass them over in silence!Let us at least hear him on the occasion of these his Commentaries on the Epistle to the Ephesians in the preface,where he writes these words: “If there be anything, OPaula and Eustochium ! which could detain in this life a489490THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwise man, and amid the turmoils and the changes of thisworld enable him to keep calm and peaceful, I think thechief and most efficacious one to be the meditation on thesacred Scriptures.” And farther on he says: “You are wellaware that I have been drawn, as though by force broughtdown by your pleadings, to undertake this labour of explaining and commentating, not because from my childhood Ihad ever ceased reading or inquiring from learned menwhat I was ignorant of, and that I had not been, as othersFor this cause it was principallyare, their own masters.that not many days past I went to Alexandria to communewith Didymus, and ask of him solutions for the doubts anddifficulties I had on the Scriptures, because it is a verydifferent thing for a man to make books of his own, suchas on avarice, on faith, virginity, on the state of widowhood,and such like matters, and upon each of these to write withthe elegance and diction of profane letters joined to thetestimonies of the holy Scriptures, and upon commonplacesexpend all the pomp of eloquence, and quite another thingto enter within the sense and mind of the apostle, or ofthe prophet, and comprehend the aim and end they had intheir writings, and by what reasoning they confirm theirFarther on again he says: “And, whereassentences.”we declared by the aid of your prayers what we felt inregard to the Epistle to the Galatians, it will be well forus to pass on to the Epistle to the Ephesians, which standsI say between, not becausebetween in sense and in order.it is less than the first ones, and greater than those thatfollow, but that it is like the heart of the animal, whichstands in the centre of the body, in order that you shouldunderstand in what great difficulties and deep questions theEpistle is enwrapped.St. Paul wrote to those of Ephesuswho worshipped Diana, not the huntress of the quiver andbow and close garments, but the Diana of many hearts, whomWRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM491the Greeks call Polymasthon, to imply by that figure thatshe brings forth and nourishes all living beings.”It is alsoproved that he first wrote upon the Epistle to Philemon,and not on the one to the Galatians, because in the prefaceto this Epistle he says: “A few days ago, after commentingon the Epistle of St. Paul to Philemon, leaving aside others,I was proceeding to do the same in regard to the one onthe Galatians, and, when most intent on my work, there cameletters from the city of Rome that the aged and venerableAlbina had gone to enjoy her God, and that the saintlyMarcella, bereft of the companionship of her mother, nowmore than ever desired your society, O Paula and Eustochium ! and, meanwhile, seeing that this cannot be effectedon account of the great distance of sea and land whichintervenes, she would wish at least to heal the recent woundwith the balm of the holy Scriptures.”In the preface ofthe second book of this Commentary he demonstrates tous who were the Galatians, whence they came, why theywere thus called, with the opinion of Lactantius and othermatters of antiquity.To the third book he writes another preface, from which,being very profitable for the disillusion of our own timesand for the comprehension of this history, I will insert someHence he says: “The third volume, O Paulaparagraphs.and Eustochium ! upon the Epistle to the Galatians alreadycommences to be planned.I am well aware of my insufficiency and the small flow of my weak and poor genius,of which scarcely a murmur is heard and the voice ofeloquefoe is barely felt.Forasmuch as what is now mostdesired in the Churches is this, that putting aside the plainspeech of apostolic words people come to sermons asthough it were the theatre of Minerva, or the place whereorators were wont to exercise themselves in order to winthe applause of the audience, while prayer, interspersed492THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwith fables and lies, comes forth before the public like adressed up harlot, not so much with the object of teaching the people as to win praise and favour, and to soundlike the tones of a sweet instrument, to tickle the ears ofthe listener: in such sort that it fits in well in these timeswith that which God spoke through the prophet Ezechiel,saying, “It is cast to them like the sound of the zither, whichsounds sweetly and with concerted harmony, and they hearThy words and do not put them in practice. What shall Ido? Shall I perchance keep silence? But it is written, “Youshall not appear empty in the presence of your Lord'; andIsaias (according to the Hebrew text) wails and sighs, saying, ‘Alas for me! why did I keep silent?’Alas! all theelegance and ornateness of the language, the beauty ofthe Latin speech, has been disarranged and made rudeby the uncouthness of the Hebrew lesson | You are wellaware that for more than fifteen years I have not takenup in my hands either Cicero or Virgil, or any of theGentile authors; and if in my discourses some time oranother something of this escapes me, it is because it comesto my memory like the mist of a former dream. Howmuch I have profited from the continual study of thatstrange tongue, let others judge; but I know how much Ihave lost of my own. To this is added that owing to myinfirmities, to not only my failing eyesight but all mywretched body, I am unable to write by my own hand, norcan I compensate for what is wanting in elegance of dictionby diligence, as is said of Virgil that his books were likethe cubs of the she-bear, which were licked by the motherinto shape and perfection.And, as I employ a copyist, ifI linger a little to think the better and express myself, hesilently reprehends me, drawing back his hand and wrinkling his brow, and by every movement of his person seemsto be telling me that he is losing time and is idle.”WRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM493From these words of St. Jerome, and other similar oneswhich he employs in the preface to the third book of hisCommentary on Zacharias, is understood the frequency of hisailments, the debility and slightness of his body, the strainof continual labour, the failing of his sight, the effect of hisvigils and penances.Here also is condemned the vaincuriosity of speakers of our time, their emptiness of expression, and the bold things they advance without respectto what they are treating upon in the sacred Scriptures.He also wrote at the petition of these two holy women theCommentaries on Micheas, Nahum, Sophonias, and Aggeus,and in the preface to the book of Sophonias he replies ina very elegant manner to those who reprehend him becausehe dedicates his labours to women; but all this we havealready treated upon.He also wrote commentaries on the other minor prophets,at the request of many pious men who were desirous ofhaving this boon, and who greatly esteemed the labours ofthis great doctor, being fully aware of the treasures thatwere enclosed within. The most notable of these piousmen, and the one for whom he wrote most, and one heheld in great respect, was Pammachius, son-in-law of St.Paula, whom she styled son; the first appellation being dueto him according to the flesh, and the second according tothe spirit. To Pammachius he dedicated the three booksof Commentaries on Osee, while in the preface to the secondbook he tells us that up to that date none of the Latins hadwritten upon this prophet, for which reason he (Jerome)was held to be a very daring man to attempt doing so.Farther on he alleges a reason which is very characteristicof himself.“I am very glad of your assistance,” he says, “forasmuch as in the principal of the cities here below I have adefender who stands as one of the first in nobility and in494THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEBut, after all, I would rather it should happen toreligion.me what Titus Livius wrote of Cato, that as regards his virtueand his excellence none could be a party to increasing them bypraise, nor lowering them by vituperation; because both theone and the other was done by men of great genius.” Thishe said in reference to Cicero and Caesar, since the one wrote“Whilstmuch in his praise, and the other in his dispraise.we live and remain enclosed in these easily broken clayvessels, it would appear that the favour of friends is ofsome use, and the opprobrium of our enemies does us harm,”he adds; “but when dust joins itself to dust, and when both,such as we writers and those who judge us, have been takenaway by pale death and been succeeded by another generation, and the first leaves of the now green trees shall havefallen, and these again be succeeded by the new ones ofanother spring, then, irrespective of dignities or names,the great genius will be judged for what he is; thereader will have no regard as to who he be, but what heproves to be, whether he be a bishop or layman, emperoror lord, whether soldier or slave, nor whether he was vestedin purple or in common cloth; the merit only of the workdone will be regarded, without respect to these differences.”This is St. Jerome's opinion, and as true as our experience clearly manifests to us. The example lies before us.Who that beholds at the present day the writings of St.Jerome, who was but a poor monk enclosed in a cell, weak,in ill-health, an outcast placed now on the height and pinnacleas a grand author, well-nigh worshipped and held up to be aluminary for all the world, a great treasure of learning forthe Church and for heaven | What became of the writingsof an infinite number of bishops, prelates, princes, and otherswho wrote in those times, and in other ages, who, whilstthey lived, held power, whom falsehood and ambition hadso greatly flattered, placing them above the moon, andWRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM495Scarcely any onewho now are buried in oblivion ?ever knows that they existed !Fate is changed: someof the writings of these serve now, as the poet says, towrap up pepper and spices in shops, to be torn byschoolboys; while those of the first order, in the sameway that they are cast to the winds and become consumed,are in their reputation rising strong on the wing, and theirnames become green again.In the preface to the thirdbook of the Commentary upon Amos he declares theorder he followed when writing upon the twelve minorprophets, and to his friend Pammachius he speaks in thiswise : “Without order and in a confused manner did webegin to write upon the minor prophets, and assisted byour Lord we have concluded doing so, not however fromthe first consecutively to the last, according to the orderwe read them, but as I could, and as I was asked, did Iexpound them—Nahum, Micheas, Sophonias, and Aggeus.I dedicated them first to Paula, and to her daughter Eustochium, as lovers of work; subsequently I dedicated twobooks upon Habacuc to Chromatius, Bishop of Aquileia.Then after a long silence, in the third instance, to you, whobade me do it, I expounded Abdias and Jonas.This presentyear, which for its glory is the sixth of the consulship ofArcadius Augustus and of Anicius Probus, I dedicate theProphet Zacharias to Exuperius, Bishop of the Church ofTolosa; and to two monks of the same city, Minnerius andAlexander, the Prophet Malachias; and from thence Ireturned to the commencement of the book, when I felt unable to deny you Osee, Joel, and Amos.After a very graveillness of my body, I manifested my boldness in the speedof my dictation, and in writing what others dared not towrite, altering many times my pen and my style, I cast it tothe wings of fate and to the mercy of the events whichfollow generally those who compose, dictating and putting496THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEto the test and place of danger both genius and doctrine;because, as I have affirmed at other times, I can no longerbear the effort of writing with my own hand, and in theexplanation of the sacred Scriptures pedantic words arenot sought for, adorned with the flowers of oratory, buterudition and the simple truth."In the preface to the Commentary upon Abdias Jeromeboth excuses and accuses himself with a charming elegancefor the daring he evinced in attempting a commentaryupon that prophet, when a youth, when he neither knewwhat he was about nor had the spirit which so greatan affair required. The Commentary upon Zacharias helikewise wrote off with extraordinary speed, as he himselftells us in the preface to those three books. The cause ofthis speed was due to Sisinius, the monk, who was sent byExuperius, Bishop of Tolosa, to visit our holy doctor andother saintly men who dwelt in Egypt leading a monasticlife.This Sisinius was very anxious to return, hence heurged upon our saint great speed; nevertheless, this hasteis not apparent in the Commentaries, for so great was histrust in the prayers of his servants to uphold him in allthis, that, despite the haste and the speed, the work cameforth very finished and perfect. As I have had alreadyoccasion to state before, the works of this man wereoffsprings, conceptions, and births produced by the powerof prayer, and which before they come forth are overshadowed by so happy a star that no adverse event canoccur to them.If I am not in error, it is my belief that inmany of these Commentaries the holy man had divinerevelations and teachings from heaven. And lest any oneshould imagine thatáf am guessing, or that I advancesome new ideas, let him listen to what he himself says inthe preface to the Commentary upon Abdias, which Iquoted just now. “When I was a child, I spoke as a child,WRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM497I had knowledge as a child, and I thought as a child.When I became a man, I put away all I had of the boy.If the apostle feels that he is advancing and leaving behindhim all the past, he stretches forth into the future, and,according to the precept of the Saviour, he put his handto the plough and did not turn his head to look back, howmuch more I, who had not attained to the state of manhoodnor to the measure of Christ ?I deserve pardon for in myyouth, awakened to the desire of the holy Scriptures, Iinterpreted in an allegorical spirit, as I knew not the literal,Abdias the Prophet.

Then he was2 K.498THE LIFE OF ST.

There have been among thelearned men of our times various opinions: I say of ourtimes, because those of earlier epochs did not drawthings so finely, for they prided themselves as beingphilosophers rather than philologists. Some affirm, withmany good reasons and conjectures, that these Commentariesare neither his, nor would it be well that they should be.”They draw the reasons from the style of diction and erudition, which in no one thing approaches Jerome; indeed,these commentaries are unworthy of such a grand name.Who can fail to note, they say, that this exposition is farremoved from St. Jerome, since, seemingly forgetful ofhistory and of the literal sense, it is all made up of allegoriesand metaphors, bringing it all down to the mystical sense1 Sixtus Sen. 4. ; lib. Blbl. S. Eras., Bruno, et Melchior Canus, de locis, lib. 2,cap. I4.WRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM499of Christ and of the Church, a thing very far from thetaste and style of this great doctor, since for having firstdone so in his early youth in his Commentary on the ProphetAbdias, he himself derides his own work, as we have justseen ? To observe how forgetful they are of the Hebrewand Greek languages, and so unmindful of the other translations, of which his writings are so full, is sufficient evidencethat these are not his. The phrasing and manner of dictionis far removed from his. Moreover, in Psalm 132 he mentionsand refers to a brother of his who was a layman, and theauthor-of these Commentaries, whosoever he may havebeen, was certainly a monk, and we are not aware thatthe saint had any other brother but Paulinian, who atthis epoch had been already ordained priest by St.Epiphanius.From all these reasons and other minorconjectures it appears conclusive to them that theseCommentaries were not Jerome's, but by some other monkof those times, who, by taking some portions from thewritings of Origen, and by adding some others out of hisown head, in the way of those who draw maps or givedescriptions of the world, and who from what is extendedand wide compress into a small piece of paper (for sodoes the owner of these Commentaries express it in thepreface), so out of the wide range of Origen he gatheredtogether this little map.Those who are of a contrary opinion, and ascribe it toSt. Jerome, also bring forward very good reasons fortheir opinion.In the first place, St. Augustine affirms hedid write on the Psalms, as may be witnessed by his EpistleIII.; St. Gregory, Pope, affirms the same in the FourthPenitential Psalm; and the doctor, St. Jerome himself, inthe third chapter on Habacuc says that sela means what theSeptuagint translates as diapsalmon, which he has alreadyMarian., In Censura ad 7 tom. Sculting, in principio confes. Hieronym. Lindam.5ooTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEdeclared extensively in the Psalms; as is verified in theFourth, where this is treated upon. And the doctor himself treated on this more widely in an Epistle to Marcella;"and it is a most grave argument for this side that theauthor of these Commentaries, when expounding in theSecond Psalm the verse Apprehendite disciplinam, says asfollows:“In the Hebrew it says in this wise, Adorate Filium[a clear prophecy of Christ] me forte irascatur Dominus,Who is the Father.” That this version and exposition areSt. Jerome's is very certain, because he himself, in thefirst book against Rufinus, says in this wise, and, whereasit comes very opportunely, I will not omit to transcribe it:“They also say he reprehends (it is understood of Rufinus)him for declaring that in the Second Psalm, in place of whatis commonly read Apprehendite disciplinam, I said in myCommentaries, Adorate Filium, and that subsequently, whentranslating into Latin from the Hebrew the whole Psalter, asthough forgetting my first exposition, I said Adorate pure,and that it is manifest to all that these things are amongTruly worthy is he of pardon, ifthemselves quite opposed.he does not know the peculiarities of the Hebrew language,who sometimes makes a slip in the Latin tongue. TheHebrew word naschu, literally interpreted, sounds the sameI, in order not to translate it as this word, whichas kiss.would appear rather lascivious, translated it in the sense ofadore, because those who worship usually kiss the handand bow down the head; hence Job always denies havingever done this to the elements or to idols, saying: ‘If Isaw the sun, when it shone, and the moon when it went onits course of light, and my heart was gladdened greatly inwhat was hidden, and I kissed my hand with my mouth—which is a great wrong, and a denial of the Highest God';and the Hebrews, in the peculiarities of their language,1 Epist. 138.WRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM5ortake the same sense of kissing as adoring, or reverencing,therefore I translated the text as they themselves understandit.In like manner is the word Bar a word of their own andit signifies diverse things.It means the same as Son, as forinstance Bar Jona, which signifies Son of a Dove; andBartholomeus, son of Ptholmeus, the same as Bar-Jew andBar-abbas.It also signifies the grain of wheat, and thewheat sheaf; and likewise does it signify as though weshould say Chosen pure.Therefore, in what did I sin, if Itranslated the word diversely, which was pregnant andambiguousAnd if in the Commentaries, where there isno liberty of speech, I said Adore the Son, and in the samevolume of the Psalms, in order not to appear to give aforced interpretation, and afford a plea for the Hebrew tocalumniate me, I said Adore purely and specially? Likewise did Aquila and Symmachus translate it. And whatharm does it work to the faith of the Church that readersshould learn here the many ways that a verse can beexplained according to the Hebrew interpretation?"All this is said by St. Jerome. He wished here to pointout and for it to be observed by such as blindly speak evilof what they know not, and do not know the advantage theknowledge of the Hebrew tongue brings with it. What textis there stronger to prove against the Hebrews themselvesthat Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and the plurality ofPersons with and under the name and relationship of Fatherand the Son?Moreover, there is drawn a very finedoctrine from this varied interpretation, and from manyother texts and passages of equal weight, as we have morefully said when we treated upon the study St. Jeromemade of this language.Returning to our purpose, it is seen that St. Jerome callsthis exposition of the Psalms his, and twice in the sameplace.This is confirmed, because in the exposition of the5o2THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEFirst Psalm the author affirms that he had seen in theBibliotheca Caesariensis a copy of the Psalms by Origen (andthere is no doubt that St. Jerome examined this library),which was written in his own handwriting, as is shown inthe Fourth Psalm. The time at which the author of theseCommentaries lived coincides very much with that of oursaint, which was near the year 400 after our Lord's Redemption, as appears in the 108th Psalm; and St. Jeromehimself, in the exposition of the third chapter of Osee,says that from the date of our Lord's Passion to that dayHisthere had passed little less than four hundred years.profession and state of life concur and greatly favour thisstatement, because he was a monk like our saint.Forso does he say in the Commentary on Psalms 119 and132; and St. Jerome's habit of quoting Aquila, Symmachus,Theodotian, and the Septuagint is not forgotten here. Healso quotes, as he often does in other places, the fifth andsixth version. And it adds no small evidence, that inPsalm 133 this author should say that some fifteen ortwenty years back the heretics were in possession of thosebuildings and walls; hence it so happened that at thissame time, and before our saint entered there, all thatproperty was in the possession of the Arians.All theseand other reasons greatly militate in favour of those whohold this opinion, and are convincing enough for me tohold them as his.As to the opinion to the contrary, it can be satisfiedeasily, because, if the style and phrasing may seem another's,it is not so different that they could not be his.In thefirst place he dictated it, or, as I imagine, it was the ordinarylesson he imparted daily to his monks at stated hours, asat times he has told us: hence, they are in the manner ofhomilies and prayers made in congregation; and from thisit came that it ended with the canonical hours, speaking toWRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM503fromspeechdictatedwell - consideredlisteners and beseeching them, and ending the discourseas though by prayer. Of this same kind I am inclined tobelieve must have been the thirty homilies on St. Luke.And who does not know that this kind of style is verydifferentwithrhetorical care, and that the texts of Scripture which occurto the mind are interpreted sometimes one way and sometimes in another.Moreover, it will be found that none ofthe holy doctors were always alike, and that what wasexpounded and explained in one sense here might on anotheroccasion and to a different purpose be interpreted otherwise;and that, if to-day he was in a certain mood, to-morrowperhaps he might feel in quite another, either for thebetter or not, or had forgotten the former one. And theSpirit of God, which oftentimes moved their tongues andpens to the profit of souls, opened the field for these variedThat Eucherius wassenses and manner of interpreting.contemporary with our saintly doctor there is no doubt,and even somewhat younger than St. Jerome might verywell have been, and also in his old age he may haveread what Eucherius wrote in his youth, as he readother things of St. Augustine, who was not older thanEucherius, and similarly to many others whom he did notinclude in the catalogue, because ever since the fourteenthyear of the Empire of Theodosius and the year 392 after ourRedemption, the date of the catalogue, until his death, manyyears elapsed. As to he who read to and discoursed withthe religious, what more appropriate subject could he havechosen than to explain to them the Psalms in a spiritualand mystic sense, so as to afford them matter for holythoughts and incentives to prayer? And for the samereason there was no need for treating of the many versionsand translations, although, as I have said, he did notaltogether ignore them, since he selected the Vulgate version504THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEof the Septuagint as being well known to the monks andunderstood by them, thus assisting the memory and following the ordinary rule of the Church. As regards what isbrought forward about a brother who was a layman, it doesnot add much force, because it might have been during theepoch before Paulinian was ordained, or he might havehad a cousin or near relative whom he called brother, butof whom no occasion had arisen for making mentionin his writings—a thing which is not of great account, sincehe never mentions his mother.Therefore it has alwaysappeared to me that the greater probability lay in theverdict that these Commentaries should be admitted tobe his.Furthermore, there is a good conjecture in thefact that in them no mention is made of heretics butsuch as had existed up to the time of St. Jerome, viz.Arians, Macedonians, Manicheans, Novatians, Marcionites,Eunomians, and others. Nor does he quote any authors butthe usual ones—Origen, Lactantius, Hilary, and Josephusin order to conclude all these objections with one morereason, and, as it were, finish the matter of evidence, so that,granted that the saint many times says that he wrote onthe Psalms, and refers to this exposition when he speaks ofthem, as appears in Isaias and in the catalogue De virisillustribus and other parts, and that the exposition of theseCommentaries agrees a thousand times with those he quotesin other places; and, furthermore, that the author of thisexposition dwelt in Bethlehem, was a monk and expounded to monks, as appears in Psalm 95, and thatit was written shortly after the Arians arose and close uponthe year 4oo of our Redeemer; hence it was either Jeromewho wrote them, or at least it was from these expositionsthat some daring person made them up—adding or subtracting the parts which are judged not to be of Jerome.I wish, nevertheless, to add a very telling conjectureWRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM505about this, that granted, as we have proved above, that ourdoctor arranged and ordained the offices of the Church,and apportioned the Psalms for the week-days according asthey agreed with the Mass, the man who should read thisexposition, and find that it agreed beautifully with the other,and that it had all come out of the same workshop, andthat these warnings and prayers which the saint puts atthe end of the exposition of each Psalm, as an epitome ofwhat he has said on the said Psalm, are very similar towhat we call collects, and are used by the Church, and that,if not the same, they partake very largely of them: letthis suffice to prove the case, for in my judgment, puttingmany other reasons aside, it seems to me of much weight.And so that this matter should be concluded in this Discourse, let it be known that the Commentaries on the Bookof Job which are found among the works of our saint arenot acknowledged by learned men to be Jerome's, for thesame reasons as have been alleged for those of the Psalms.The style, the phraseology, and the language are not at allequal to his; the manner of commenting very different;the chronology and the reasoning do not tally withthose of St. Jerome: it is said they are rather like Bede,for many reasons. This is also my belief, and I agree withthem, although I should not omit to repeat here the wordsof Cassiodorus, an author of that time, or about 559, in hisbook Of the Divine Lessons. He says as follows: “TheBook of Job merited approbation on account of the diligenceof St. Jerome, so cleverly translated into Latin, and so wellcommentated.” And the same criticism does he pass onthe exposition of the Proverbs of Solomon, which is alsoattributed to Bede, because he cites St. Gregory, Pope, inChapter XXXI., and also St. Jerome in Chapter XXX., andThe Commentaries on theSt. Augustine in Chapter VI.Thirteen Epistles of St. Paul, which are likewise found in506THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEcluded among his works, are, by common consent, excludedunquestionably, because they are not worthy of so noble amaster.These are undoubtedly the work of some Pelagian,because in the Epistle to the Romans, in the first to theCorinthians, in that to the Philippians, and the one toTimothy, there are many Pelagian propositions.Hence,It has been thelet this be here declared once and for all.fate of all the holy doctors, and the ancient fathers (as wehave touched upon already), that they all suffered shipwreckin their works; many indeed were lost, and the gap wasfilled up in this rich merchandise by the substitution ofmuch foolish writing, the outcome of great audacity, whichusurped their great names, and thus imposed upon us asthough ignorant and blind, that we should be unableto distinguish alchemy from true gold, nor the light of asingle candle from that of the mid-day sunOne of thosewho most suffered on this point was St. Jerome, yet itwas in him that the disguise was soonest revealed, hisgenius and his style being so extraordinary that some onemight deem that he could imitate him, but it would happento such an one, as the poet tells us,Speret idem, sudet multum frustraque laboret:Ausus idem, tantum series juncturaque pollet."... ut sibi quivisMany sought to imitate him, and thought to succeedwith the same; they laboured in vain, because his mannerof binding together sentences and words is a thing fewcan do: some little thing they imitated deceived them.So greatly was this assisted by the ignorance of thetimes, that many of those who were to give sentencefollowed the current and gave authority to falsehood,and even at this present day some are vexed if a single1 Hor., in Arte Poèt.WRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM507page is touched of what is bound between the boards, solong as it is entitled with the august name of Jerome, notlooking to the effect but to the censor, to the contrary ofJesus Christ. One of the things that prudent commentators call in question at first is the title of the work, and thenthe name of the author; for even in the Sacred Letters,although there is but one author of them all, which is theHoly Ghost, the commentators demand who was the author:whether it was Moses who wrote the Book of Job; whetherSamuel the two first Books of Kings; and if Solomonwrote that of Wisdom: how much more so in the case ofthose who have not so sovereign an origin. And theyhave good reason for this, especially in the books of thedoctors and fathers of the Church, upon the concordanceand harmony of which depend so many and such gravethings; hence must these be viewed with many eyes, asregards their titles, in order that their works be not admittedaS those of saints, which in truth are not worthy of suchgreatness. Many authors kept back their names in thebooks they wrote for many reasons: sometimes throughhumility, like the one who wrote the book on the chiefvirtues of Christ, addressed to St. Cornelius, Pope, becausethe author himself says so; and, as it was seen later that whenSt. Cyprian at times wrote to St. Cornelius the people atonce gave out the book to be St. Cyprian's.Other authorsdo not wish to put a name, in order to see with greaterfreedom what opinion the world forms of their books, likeApelles behind the board.St. Gregory Nazianzen, in thepreface to his book, De Fide, says he persuaded a friend ofhis to remove the title of the author, and read it out to somepersons, in order to see what they thought of it, and amendwhat good judges should find fault with.Others disguisetheir name because they feel the work would not be wellreceived if the name of the author were made known, and508THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEfor this reason does St. Jerome say that St. Paul omittedhis in the Epistle to the Hebrews, who were his brethren,knowing that they were so ill-disposed towards him forhaving left Judaism, and that, on finding his name attachedto it, they would refuse to read what was of such importanceto them; hence many thought that Epistle was the work ofOthers, again,St. Barnabas, or one of the other apostles.omit their name so as not to anger those they touch, andthus remove envy and hatred, since these might judgethe books were written against them purposely; and thisis declared by St. Jerome in the dialogues against thePelagians, where he puts in the names of Critobulus andAtticus, so that no individual should feel he was attackingthem. Others, again, who feel that their own work is of smallimportance, oftentimes done at the pleadings of friends, whohave little experience, do not wish to put their name, and lateron those who succeed them put on any name they fancy.Others, to avoid vainglory, like Salvianus Massiliensis,entitled their books Pareneticos, under the nom de Plume ofTimothy; and Vincentius of Lerins called his book againstthe heresies Peregrinus, to charm with this name theheretics themselves, who loved singular things.Otherswould write solely as an exercise, and put no name, becausethere was nothing solid or meant in earnest: they werecalled progymnasmata, these said writings, which wereliterary ventures previous to the formal ones.Of thiskind many think, and not unduly, are the dialogues ofAugustine and Orosius upon Genesis; and among theGentiles the Epistles of Phalaris of Agrigentum, and theEpistle of Brutus; and even those between Seneca andPaul. Some ignorantly believe that they are the worksof those whose names are assumed in these exercises.Allthese reasons for concealing names are proper and fair, andsuch as did not understand them ascribed names to themWRITINGS WHILE IN BETHLEHEM509as best pleased their fancy, according as they thought theydetected some similarity to those authors; more especiallywas this done at the commencement, when they fell into thehands of copyists who were of small learning, had littleexperience, and less reading of various authors.Othercauses, less good, for disguising names of the writers existed,such as hoaxing the readers and deceiving them, by makingthem read childish things under the name of grave authors.And even worse reasons existed, for they wrote to scattererrors and instil the poison of malice in golden cups. At thebeginning of the Church much of this came forth: from thisflowed those spurious gospels spoken of above by our saint,ascribed to Bartholomew, Thomas, Philip, and others, theinvention of the Manichees, who assumed the names ofthose apostles in order to effect the deception.There are many other causes for the falseness of thosetitles, but it would be too long for us to linger over themnow. The manner of knowing them we have well-nighrevealed, when stating the reasons we have alleged, in orderto know whether the works that are put forward and whichwe have examined of St. Jerome be his or not; the first andprincipal one being the style and phraseology, for thereis no better loadstone to discover their genuineness thanthis.After this, the time, the place, the circumstances ofthe person, the authors quoted, the doctrine advanced, if itbe coherent and alike, the heresies which are reprobated,and a number of other conjectures, so that it is well-nighimpossible for one who issues lies to observe them all.DISCOURSE THE EIGHTHAccount of what happened to St. Jerome with a Lion in theOrdination of his BrotherDisputes that arise between St. JeromeBethlehem Monastery.Paulinus.and John of Jerusalem.A LIFE of St. Jerome is found among the works of ourlearned doctor by an anonymous writer of the classdescribed in the former discourse, although some authoritymight be assigned to it on account of its antiquity, sincefor some hundreds of years it has been in such goodcompany.In it is found related in detail that on one daywhen, as was usual to St. Jerome, he was conversing withhis monks on the sacred Scriptures and reading to them hisdaily lesson, there entered the monastery (which, in truth,could not have many closed doors) a ferocious lion, limpingon three feet, holding up the fourth paw as though in painand unable to set it on the ground. The monks, full ofterror at the sight of the wild beast, fled in all directions, where each judged best to be out of danger. Ourholy Father, however, approached, without manifesting fear,the formidable lion, which lifted up its foot higher to haveit inspected. The saint took up the proffered paw betweenhis hands, and, on carefully examining it, found thata long splinter had pierced it through. He gently drewit out, and applied to the wound what he judged would5IoSTORY OF THE LION51 Irelieve the pain. The royal beast manifested its gratefulness for the good deed done by becoming quite tame andmeek, and showing pleasure in remaining in the companyof the religious. When the monks witnessed this, theylost all fear of the lion, and approached trustfully to him,while the lion on its part rubbed his head against them,Here thequite pleased and happy at being among them.author describes the saint as consulting with his monkshow best to employ their new guest, so that he should notbe idle, and proceeds to relate that it was decided inchapter to impose the task on the lion of keeping guardover the donkey which was employed there to bring dailyfrom the forests the load of wood needed for the serviceof the monastery. The lion used to lead the donkey tothe fields and woods in the morning, and conduct it backin the evening, and, as the task was not a severe one, thelion easily fulfilled it. One day, while waiting for thedonkey to return, the lion overslept himself, and, whilehe slept, some traders passed that way from Syria toEgypt with their caravan of oil and merchandise, and,meeting the donkey alone, judged it had no owner, andled it away to serve as guide for their loaded camels.Later in the day the lion awoke.It was long after thecaravan and men had passed on with the donkey. Thelion sought for his companion everywhere, but could notfind it, and, after searching fruitlessly for the poor ass, thelion had to return to the monastery, sad and cast down,as though quite ashamed of himself. The monks, whosaw him return alone without his companion, suspectedthat, harassed by hunger (because the ration of food givenhim was not large), he had eaten up the little donkey, andthey treated him roughly, upbraiding him, and refusingeven to give the small ration allowed him daily, tellinghim to go back and finish what he had left of the donkey.512THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMESt. Jerome, however, took pity on the lion in his disgrace,and bade the monks give him his food, and not ill-treathim, and, as a penance for his wrong-doing, to takethe lion to the forest every day, and make him bring theload of wood which his companion the ass should havebrought.This was done, and daily, with, great meeknessand patience, did the lion bear his humiliation, for it wasin truth a great come-down for a lion to be used as adonkey.According to this author, God assisted him, and gavehim the instinct one day to sally forth to the fields, after hehad performed his allotted task. Good luck brought backthe ass and the camels, for the traders were returning bythat way with their caravan. The lion, on perceivingthis, bounded with joy, and, coming towards the caravanunperceived, uttering a terrific roar, which resounded farand near, infused such fright and terror into the men thatthey fled to hide themselves, leaving the loaded camelsand the ass in the fields. The lion then joyfully led thedonkey and the camels with their loads to the monastery.The monks greatly marvelled at this return, and discoveredhow the donkey had been stolen, and that the lion was innocent of the charge imputed to him of having destroyed thepoor ass. Shortly after this the traders themselves appearedat the monastery. They asked pardon for the theft ofthe ass, and offered in reparation a part of the oil theywere bringing. The saint forgave them, and they departed on their way. The event itself I hold to be true,despite that the author relates it in a somewhat childishstyle.Thus it occurs in many of the miracles of the saints that,through being narrated by ignorant men, they have beenridiculed and thought unworthy of belief, more especiallyamong persons of small piety who are poorly instructedTHE LION AS AN EMBLEM513and deny everything, ever seeking occasion to cast contempt upon any occurrence, even attempting to deny themiracles and signs of Christ, which prove and confirm Hisevangelical doctrine, in the first place, and, secondly, theauthority of His ministers and the respect due to them, towhom He promised that they should perform greatermarvels than He Himself had done. These are the reasonsfor the performance of miracles, and which these apostatesof the faith would obscure, if they could. There are piousCatholics who declare that this event did not happen toour saint, but to the saintly Abbot Gerasimus, who dweltnear the shores of the Jordan, of whom Sophronius,in his Pratum spirituale, recounts a similar case, andit appears that, as no grave author made any mentionof it, nor does Jerome himself speak of it in his writings,as well as the similarity of the names Gerasimus andJerome, he may have been mistaken for the other;moreover, that in Bethlehem and its surroundings thereare no lions, and that about the Jordan they are found;and thus this event did not happen to Jerome, but toGerasimus, or that, at least, it remains doubtful.This maybe pardoned them if it remains no further than a doubt,and they do not altogether deny it, because, in thenarratives of the saints, and more especially in saints ofsuch early date, many things may be doubtful, but thereasons they would allege for their doubt are of insufficient force to upset a fact so universally received, andacknowledged throughout the world, as for many agesbefore our time St. Jerome was always depicted with thelion as a natural emblem, for in truth the faithful wouldnot believe it to be the saint without the lion, nor wouldknow him to be St. Jerome.Indeed this has been sowidely received that it has become the device and symbol1 Basil. Sanct, in Sanctorali, et alii.2 L514THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEof the saint.St. Jerome has in himself and all his affairssuch force and a vigour so native, accompanied by so wideand generous a heart, that with nothing else could allMoreover, he isthis be so well signified as by a lion.so terrible and fearless, when proceeding against pagans,heretics, Jews, false Christians, and, indeed, against allthe enemies of Christ, that no greater could have beenthe terror and astonishment of those who stole the gentledonkey when they heard the terrible roar of the naturallion, than the terror inspired in the hearts of all thoseabove mentioned men by the fearless writings and wordsof the mystic doctor. That neither the saintly doctor norany other author of name should have recorded this caseThis is not ancould hardly be a reason for marvelling.event St. Jerome would have taken any notice of, norhave ascribed to anything out of the common but a thingwhich had naturally occurred. We have not other authorsto recount this, nor even many other affairs of greater importance, because none of the people of those times undertook to write his life, although many saints and gravemen were not slow in lauding up to the skies his works;and this would not be a thing to write about, unless whenwriting his life in detail. Whether Eusebius of Cremonadid so or not, remains yet to be found out. At least Ihave my private opinion that it is certain that the lifewherein this event is narrated in detail was not his, norcould he have been a disciple of so great a doctor whowas a man of so ordinary a stamp. The Sophronius who,we said, recounts this event as applying to Gerasimus,Abbot, flourished about the year 780. He was present atthe second Nicene Council, being Patriarch of Jerusalem,and he declared in his book, which he entitled Pratumspirituale, that he himself heard the story recounted bythe disciples of Gerasimus, who actually witnessed it.STORIES OF LIONS515Hence it appears that this marvel (if such we are to call it)occurred more than three hundred years after the time ofour holy doctor. And why should not a case of this kindhave occurred to both saints in different epochs? Havewe not seen similarly singular cases occur? We findamong the Gentiles that such like cases have occurredPliny tells of a slave in Rome calledwith lions.Andronius, one of those brought into slavery from thewars of Dacia, that when, as a fugitive, he lay hidden inthe deserts, he extracted a thorn from a most ferociouslion, and for this benefit the animal became so friendly andloyal that, when this same slave on a future occasion wasbrought to Rome, and condemned to be cast with the lionsinto the arena, the hapless Andronius, placed there inthe amphitheatre, met this same lion, which had beencaptured along with other wild beasts and set there; herecognised Andronius, and not only did the lion do him noharm, but he actually carried the man quietly away andsafely landed him outside the dangerous place.This caseis well known to all, and there is no cause for us to lingerover it.By other authors,a similar case is recounted ofMentor, a native of Sicily, who drew a thorn out ofanother lion, and the beast was likewise grateful to him.Of Elpius, Samius narrates a similar thing. Thus is seenthat these cases have been of frequent occurrence, andtherefore it does not militate against Jerome that it shouldin like manner have occurred to Gerasimus.Hence theone rather proves the possibility of the others. Thelion, as it has a generous heart, is grateful for benefitsreceived, because it appertains only to low and brutal heartsto be ungrateful, such as are the wolves and the foxes, andmen who boast to have these low conditions of cruelty are1 Raubisius.516THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEungrateful, who only seek their own interest.I myselfhave had experience of them. On the contrary, the lion(a proper symbol of great princes and magnanimous men)has no enmity to man; it can easily be domesticated, and,when tenderly treated, altogether loses its fury.Thatwhich has been advanced that in Bethlehem there are nolions, and that they exist on the Jordan and along itsbanks, appears to proceed rather from a limited knowledge of the sacred Scriptures, for when these writersforget all other cases they should surely remember thatDavid vaunted he had killed a lion whilst tending hisfather's flocks on the Mountains of Bethlehem, thusclearly proving they were often assailed by them, and byFor the mannerthe bears, which frequented those parts.of speaking of David teaches us so. The strong Banaiaskilled another lion which had on the occasion of a greatsnowfall pitched into a pit, either from excess of thirstor unconsciously, in that locality, and the holy Scripturessay” that this was a specially fierce lion, giving us tounderstand that, although there were others, yet nonemore daring or bolder—in the same way as the boar ofArcadia and the lion of the Idean forest were renownedamong the Gentiles. And when the Patriarch Jacobcalled his son Judas lion, it was also an allusion that in theportion given to him of the land promised by God therewere many lions, and Bethlehem was included in thatportion, as in the same sense he told him of the abundanceof milk and wine declared above.That mountainousdistrict, adapted for the pasture of cattle and flocks,is, as a consequence, the resort of wild beasts, whichfind prey there.From this comes that careful watchingof the flocks over which the Evangelist says” the shepherds were keeping guard, watching in turns by hours,I Reg. xvii. 34.Paral. xi. 22.8 Luke ii. 8.COMPARED TO A LION517which are called vigils, divided according to the fourwatches.They were very near Bethlehem in that part, which iscalled Tamer of the flock, as we have already mentioned.From all this is seen that there is no reason for beingcarried away by such trifling conjectures, and placing indoubt a fact so universally received as this—that, because the thing happened to Gerasimus, it could not betrue also of Jerome.By the same rule they would saythat, whereas bees were seen coming and going out ofthe mouth of St. Ambrose when a child, it could not betrue in regard to St. Isidore and others.I believe, also, that our Lord ordained this witha purpose—to give us to understand by it the worthof His holy doctor, and it was His wish that St. Jeromeshould be seen accompanied by the lion, similarly as St.John with the lamb. The strength of the one animal andthe meekness of the other are two things very proper toAnd this portion fell to Jerome to be repreChrist.sented thus.Wisdom tells us that the lion is thestrongest of all the animals, and does not fear confrontingany other, nor does it ever turn its back upon others—a thingwhich was proved always as a characteristic of this saint,since, in the number and variety of the encounters he hadduring his long life, never did they succeed in making himturn aside from following the path of his highest aims.The Hebrew language, which, as has been already said, isthe mother of all others, gives the same name to the lionas to the heart, to demonstrate that in the same way asthe lion among beasts is the most fearless and strongest,so in like manner in the animal part of man the heart is theseat of power and principle of life. Among the saintly doctorsof the Church Jerome appears as the lion whereupon allmay rest, and from whom depends the principles and518THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwell-spring of holy doctrine, forasmuch as his whole lifewas employed in giving us clearly and purely the force andtruth of the doctrine of the holy Scriptures, which withHere alsosuch good reason is styled The Book of Life.is discerned the reason why God ordered that the highpriest was to carry the breastplate on his breast, where theheart has its seat. On it were placed the twelve stonesengraved with the names of the twelve tribes, because allrest on the heart of the doctors of the Church. TheScriptures in the original language use the word leb in thattext, which is nearly the same as lion, because not onlyfrom it is virtue communicated to the people depending onit, but also because the hearts of the doctors constitutethe common defence and terror of the enemies; for, whereitis necessary, to God himself must they manifestresistance, as was done by Phinees and Moses, who keptHis Divine Majesty takes delightback divine wrath.that there should be such saintly men, who in this holymanner dared to do so. The greatness of St. Jeromeand his noble courage gives us permission thus to speak.But let us revert to the thread and discourse of hisaffairs, because for so fully admitted a subject as theabove what has been said in defence suffices. At thisepoch the sad news arrived at Bethlehem of the entryof the barbarian Goths, Genseric and Radagasus, intoDalmatia and Pannonia. We have already alluded to thecruel devastation which they effected in those provincesin the words of our saint.Scarcely any living thing wasleft; even the very birds of the air were destroyed. Ourman of God grieved with tender feeling; in his heart heseriously judged this to be a punishment from heavenfor their barbarous customs their receiving the cruel lashof these uncouth men. As from many divers parts ofthe world saintly men had flocked to Bethlehem, togetherORDINATION OF PAULINIAN519with devout ones, and those who were desirous of improving themselves in the school of this great doctor,Jerome found himself pressed and constrained on all sides,for he had not the courage to dismiss them, nor had hethe means to support them.It occurred to him, then, tosend his brother Paulinian to his own country and lands, todispose of the towns and personal inheritance whichmight have escaped the fury of the barbarian Goths, in order,with the result of the sale, to enable him to finishthe monastery which had been commenced, and, if possible,enlarge the buildings, so as to be able to shelter the devoutflock that came seeking him.This is related by thesaint himself" in the Epistle to Pammachius, towards theend, and in another Epistle” to Rufinus he says thathis brother Paulinian had not yet returned from thejourney, and thinks that very probably he may have methim in Aquileia, where the holy bishop Chromatius, hisfriend, resided. On the return of his brother with whathad resulted from the sale of the aforesaid possessions,the building was finished, yet not so costly as convenient,and adapted to the holy purpose intended.Paulinianwas a man of exalted virtue, and, I doubt not, also verylearned, and held in high esteem in those parts, belovedmost especially by St. Epiphanius, who could not dowithout him.Hence when he attained the proper age,which was thirty, he at once ordained him priest,since he was already a deacon. Thus he kept him at hisside all to himself.Orders were conferred on Paulinianin a monastery which lay in the limits of Eleutheropolis.All this was against the will of the holy youth, and itbecame necessary, so to say, to order him silence,and, as it were, compel him to obey. The resistance heoffered was to conjure them by the name of Jesus Christ1 Epist. 26.Epist. 56.52oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEnot to ordain him; and his appeal was so strong thatthey dared not act to the contrary. So that Paulinianshould desist, the holy Epiphanius ordered his deaconsboth whenand presbyters to cover up his mouth,conferring the order of deacon, and when consecratinghim to the priesthood.is stated in detailAllby the saintly Bishop of Cyprus in an epistle hewrote to John, Bishop of Jerusalem, wherein he manifestsofthePaulinian.humility, andgreat virtue,perfectionthisAfter this time the said Bishop of Jerusalem took occasion to break with Epiphanius and Jerome.

The subject of complainthe urged was that St. Epiphanius had conferred holyorders within his own diocese, without obtaining his license,and without giving him notice of such intended orders.Moreover, that Paulinian was a youth and not of age to beordained priest; and that both the one thing and the otherwere against the canons and ordinances of the Church.

These saintly men repliedthat in none of these had he reason: firstly, because themonastery wherein the holy orders had been conferred didnot belong to his jurisdiction, nor to the Church of Jerusalem, but to the Church of Eleutheropolis, which is foundedat the base of Mount Libanus; secondly, that Paulinianwas of ripe age for receiving holy orders, for he was thirtyyears old, which age is held of sufficient maturity even fora bishop, much more for receiving the dignity of thepriesthood, since he, John, had not attained that age whenAs regards the division in thehe was made bishop.Church which he complained of, that it was not they whohad caused any such, but he himself, for he had declaredthem under , excommunication, and furthermore placedunder the same ban any who would hold Paulinian to be apriest.In regard to their praying for him, never hadEpiphanius named him or singled him out in the Churchtreacherously, but only had he remonstrated and renewed his522THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEprayer, pleading to God for all, according as it was properto end with divine words the concluding clauses of theprayer.But all these reasons and replies were of no avail,despite that they were good and evident, to cure his malice,because it was not on this account, nor was it this whichhad hurt him; hence, making use of the power which as abishop was vested in him, and the favour of the princes,he first of all excommunicated all clergy and subjects whomaintained that Paulinian was a priest, and then sent lettersthroughout the world to sow complaints and grievances;he wrote to Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, he wroteto Rome, and he wrote to the Emperors, and he evenobtained leave to exile St. Jerome, together with hismonks, on whom, by reason of the monastery of Bethlehemstanding in the diocese of Jerusalem, the chief part of theexcommunication fell, because the monks could not in anyway declare or hold Paulinian to be other than a priest.He used to come and converse with them, and saymass there, feeling secure of the wrath of the wickedbishop not touching him, since he was a subjectofAnd, although theEpiphanius, and lived under his rule.censure of excommunication, owing to being so wrong,unjust, and, moreover, pronounced by a man whose faithwas so suspicious, did not in truth affect the monks, norhad they anything to fear—rather by that path theyattainedblessing pronounced by Him whoBlessed are ye when they shall revile thee forsaid,My sake—nevertheless, St. Jerome and his monks, likeholy men, full of fear and obedient to the Church, abstainedfrom entering the holy places and from communicating withHence Jerome was absent from his belovedthe faithful.crib; and he would gaze and contemplate it from the outside, though in truth his spirit and soul were within, andfrom thence adored it, as in other times David, the holythatto- - -----------"DISPUTES WITH THE BISHOP OF JERUSALEM523king, had done, when flying away from Saul, and yetsighed for the House of the Lord.And so bitter did the hatred conceived in the breastof the wicked prelate become (for the exercise of ourglorious Father) that he prevailed on the EmperorTheodosius to order the exile of Jerome and his monks,but by the Divine Will the order was of no effect, because,on the Emperor more fully investigating the case andobtaining further information, he revoked the order given.Now the Count Archelaus, a pious, learned, and saintlyman, interposed as a third, in order to effect peace betweenEpiphanius and Jerome on the one part and the Bishopof Jerusalem on the other.This Count, as is gatheredfrom the historians of that time, was proconsul of thatprovince, sent by the Emperor. The place of meetingwas arranged, but John, the bishop, did not dare to makean appearance, excusing himself with trifling reasons.Thus peace remained in abeyance. The Count wrote tohim many times, begging him to come, for they wereawaiting him, but without result, and he was never ableto force him to make an appearance.Then did hismalice become clearly manifest. He wrote to Theophilus,the Patriarch of Alexandria, a very long letter, quite outside the purpose, attempting to cover and disguise whathe was accused of.Theophilus, somewhat convinced bythe letter, sent out a monk called Isidore, who was a manof authority, to arrange and restore Jerome and his monksto the friendship and obedience of the bishop, and uponthis affair he likewise wrote to our saint.Jerome repliedwith great humility, manifesting how great was his owndesire for that peace which he urged, but that it must be atrue peace and not founded on malice, nor one that wouldimperil the things of the faith and the good doctrines of theJerome discovered to him in this letterCatholic Church.524THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe secret of this case, and gave Theophilus clearly tounderstand that the causes of the enmity and dissensionwere not in respect to Paulinian; that it was not on thatpoint that the question depended, but because he hadaccused him of being an Origenist, and a man who maintained the errors of Origen. He revealed to him eightmanifest pernicious errors which were upheld by theBishop of Jerusalem.Theophilus thus having been enlightened and in theend fully convinced, began to give up his friendship andto favour the cause of Epiphanius and Jerome. Thefalsehood having thus been revealed and made clear, Johnwas held in suspicion, and the monks of Palestine keptaloof from communicating with him, as he was held by allas a heretic, and as one excommunicated, for he had daredto silence and lay hands on two such great men asEpiphanius and Jerome, calling one senile and withoutjudgment, and the other he had dared to excommunicate.In this affair St. Jerome manifested himself to be a braveand courageous lion, because, on points of faith and in allthat touched good doctrine and the integrity of the Church,whatsoever would cross his path he would attack with abrave heart, and resist like a noble lion, and tear to pieces.All threats and dangers that presented themselves tohim could not for a single moment inspire fear; he wasnever cowed by the wrath or by the power of him whowas his own prelate, when he perceived that he was nothis legitimate superior in the faith.Neither excommunication nor persecution, nor finding himself deprivedof his beloved crib and of approaching the holy altar, norhis humiliation and painful exile—none of these did heesteem as anything in comparison to turning his faceagainst, or to deviating from even one of the smallestpoints of the fidelity due by him to the Church.DISPUTES WITH THE BISHOP OF JERUSALEM525All this we have stated in a cursory manner, so to say,in order that it should be understood what the course wasof these disputes; for the fidelity of history demands thatall should be seen qualified, and with that certitude whichis in reason.Let us hear the saint himself, in the letter hewrote to Pammachius in respect to the errors of the said Johnof Jerusalem, forasmuch as his complaints reached Rome,and the things he stated against Epiphanius and Jeromewere scattered, and he had favourers, more especiallyauthorised by Melania, Rufinus, and others, who hadmany adherents in Rome and who favoured him. On thisbeing witnessed by Pammachius, he very soon urgentlyenjoined on our holy doctor to write and state the casevery carefully, and make the truth of the matter known.I will here transcribe the points of this epistle, which moreespecially relate to the case, in order that this discoursebe better understood. Among other things it states asfollows: “I will not consent, nor wish that in a case ofsuspicion of heresy any one should exercise patience, so thatit be overlooked, and this dissimulation be not remarked bysuch as know not their ignorance by default of their properconscience.”He proceeds' to recount after this oneby one all the errors, the chief being, first, that our soulsare in our bodies as in a prison; that they were createdbefore God formed man in Paradise, and that they wereabove amid the angels in heaven, and I know not for whatdemerits God exiled them in these bodies, as in a prisonhouse.After this, secondly, he says that devils will atsome time or other do penance (which thing never occurredto them), and will come to reign with the saints in heaven.The third was most perverse of all: he denies the resurrection of the flesh, and the distinction of sex, and thatthey would have bodies in the other life, but not of flesh,1 Epist. 61, ad Pamach.526THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEbut a class of aerial or celestial bodies, with no distinctionof sex, and other such like absurdities, all drawn from theevil doctrine of Origen.After detailing them all ourholy doctor tells him as follows: “Do you wish to knowhow great is the fervour of good believers?”Listen towhat the apostle says: “If I or any angel from heavenshould preach a gospel otherwise than I have preached thegospel to you, let him be anathema, or excommunicated.”A little farther on he adds: “I tell you in truth, were I, tohear such things as these said by my father, mother, orbrethren, like to a raving dog I would fly at their mouthsand tear them asunder, and I should be the first to placemy hands on them.” Those who would say (says God inDeuteronomy) to their father and to their mother, I knowyou not, would have fulfilled the will of God.” “He wholoveth father or mother more than Christ is not worthy ofChrist.” How Jerome here manifests his vivid faith! Whata holy impatience does he show concerning false doctrine andbad Christians, deceitful, and artful, and cunning! Fartheron, as a consequence of this, he says, speaking with Pammachius, and with whoever should read the letter: “I willbriefly declare what Origen and his followers feel on theResurrection. You cannot comprehend the power of themedicine, if you do not penetrate the malice of the poison.Seek attentively, and turn again to read, and count up how,naming nine times the resurrection of the body, he neversays that of the flesh, and thus hold from henceforth assuspicious what he with so much artfulness has passedover.This is all the reason [he says this, assuming hespeaks with Origen and with John of Jerusalem] why inyour declaration of faith, in order to deceive the earsof the ignorant, you said nine times body, and not onceflesh, so that they should think that body and flesh be allDeut. xxxiii.Matt. xx.DISPUTES WITH THE BISHOP OF JERUSALEM527one thing; and hence you will say when you are challenged:I spoke simply, I thought that it was all one, body andflesh. One thing is flesh, and another is body: it maywell be the body aerial or celestial, although flesh musthave blood, veins, bones, and nerves. Body is the sun andthe moon, the stars, fire and water. Do you see, then,how we penetrate your apparent subtleties, such as youdiscuss in secret in your corners? Then understand thatin the symbol of our faith and hope (taught from theapostles, not written on paper with ink, but in the tablesof our hearts of flesh) after the confession of faith, of trinityof persons, and of the unity of the Church, the wholesacrament of the Christian doctrine is enclosed in theresurrection of the flesh; yet you never mention flesh, butnine times body. And the apostle, speaking to the Colossians, when teaching that the body of Jesus Christ is notaerial, spiritual, or subtle, but of flesh, spoke significantly,saying: “And you, having been sometime withdrawn fromChrist and enemies of what He desires (by reason of yourbad works), reconciled and joined together by His deathin the body of His flesh.’” And farther down he repeatsthe same.St. Jerome treats of this point very exhaustively,revealing the malice of the adversary, and confirmingthe doctrine of the faith, like a most grave doctor, in amost profound and learned manner, in the course of whichhe touches upon divine and hidden mysteries, which itgrieves me much that space does not allow me toIn order to understand the proposition, whatdevelop.this examplehas been adduced suffices, because inis comprehended the line he followed in regard tothe other errors, confuting, undoing them, and teachingtrue doctrine, clearness, and dexterity. The bishop, Johnof Jerusalem, always maintained that the contention was528THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEnot on things of faith, but because of the breach Jeromeeffected in the ordinances, and canons of the Church, whoformed another head within his bishopric; and he wouldnot therefore consent to this division and schism. He wasvery anxious to exaggerate this, in order to divert themfrom the point; but he was contending with one whoJerome replies to him, driving himunderstood him well.closely without repeal and without evasion, saying: “If thecause of the disagreement does not depend on differencesof faith, but on the holy orders conferred on Paulinian, ashe says, it is a great folly not to reply to those who affordhim the occasion.Confess simply the faith, and reply towhat you are asked in order that it be made manifest thatfaith is not the question of dissension, but holy orders;because, while you maintain silence, and do not replyto thequestion of faith, your adversary will say intruth and in reason: The cause is not orders, but thefaith.Because they divide the Church, you say, andthey should not make a head for themselves. Who dividesthe Church P We, who in the house of Bethlehem arein communion with, and who converse with the wholeChurch, or yourself, who thinks it well, or with pride willnot reply to the question of faith, you do so badly andthus divide the Church? Do we divide the Church? We,who but a few months back, when close upon the days ofPentecost the sun becoming darkened, the world alreadythought in trembling that the Judgment had come, Isay, delivered to your priests forty persons, men andwomen, for you to baptize them.For in all certaintythere were in our monastery five priests, who by a justtitle could well have baptized them, but they did not wishto arouse your wrath, so as not to give an occasion towithhold the questions of faith.Perchance is it not youyourself who divide the Church, when you ordered yourDISPUTES WITH THE BISHOP OF JERUSALEM529priests who are here in Bethlehem that they should notgive baptism to any of ours at Easter, and I had to sendthem to Dionysius, the Bishop of Diospolis, for him tobaptize them? You will say that we divide the Church,who out of our cells have no place in the Church?Isit not yourself who divide the Church, when you orderyour priests that, if any one should say that Paulinian isconsecrated priest by Epiphanius, they should not allowsuch a one to enter the Church? From that day up tothe present we gaze solely upon the cave of the Lord; and,whilst the heretics have a free entrance, we stand terrifiedand sigh.Is it we who divide the Church, forsooth, or he,who denies a dwelling to the living, burial to the dead,and, as to the religious, compasses their banishment?”In the letter which he wrote to Theophilus, Patriarchof Alexandria, who, as I have already said, was treating forpeace before he had been fully informed, he says as follows:“The cause of the discord, he pretends to say, is on accountof my brother Paulinian, a man who keeps to his cell in hismonastery, and the clergy do not call it a dignity but acharge. And after having flattered us up to the presenttime with a feigned place, he is now filling the ears of thepriests of the West with the cries that he is only ayoungster, and no more than a boy, and that in a parish ofhis in Bethlehem they have ordained him to the priesthood. Whether this be true or not is a thing well knownThe monastery of theto all the bishops of Palestine.holy Bishop Epiphanius, called the Ancient, where mybrother was ordained to the priesthood, is in the territory ofEleutheropolis, and not in that of Greece. His age is alsoknown to your holiness, and forasmuch as he has reachedthirty years, I think there is nothing to object to in his age,since, conformably to the mystery of Christ incarnate, it isa perfect age and full, and I fancy that, when he himself2 M53oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwas raised to the Episcopate his age did not differ fromthat of my brother; if then this is also allowed to bishops,why not to priests?”Then farther on he continues:“A short time since he demanded that we should bebanished, and he obtained our exile. Would that I couldcarry it out, for just as from him will be taken account asto his intention by the act, so also of us not only by theintention but by the fact, we should obtain the crown ofexile. By the shedding of blood and suffering affronts, butnot by inflicting them, was the foundation of the Church ofChrist effected, and it increased by persecution.”From these brave, fervent words, and many moresimilarly ardent ones, which he continues writing, is knownthe warm and great desire St. Jerome had to suffer forJesus Christ, for His truth, His faith, and His Church.Small fear did the generous lion feel for threats, or thefears arising from the acts of men at the cost of performinghis duty and running his course perfectly; he esteems hislife no more than he does himself, like to another St. Paul,doctor of the Gentiles, and thus he adds a little fartheron : “A monk, alas! what a sorrow ! demands, holds out,and threatens with exile other monks; he himself a monk,who prides himself that he occupies the apostolic chair! Lethim understand that this race of men knows not what fearof the knife is, which threatens, nor cares to cross hands,but only to submit the neck.Because who of the monkstruly exiled himself from his house and country, who isnot banished already from the world?What need isthere of a public authority, and of obtaining writs andLetdeeds, and calling at ports throughout the world?him therefore tap at the door with his little finger alone,and with right good heart we will leave.

Of the Lord'sis the earth and all that is contained therein; in everypart is Christ, more especially to one who carries Himwithin himself, to one who never leaves Him, as thegreat Jerome, who never quitted his God.Now, atthis time, among other things, a great evil was doneEusebius, hisby Bishop John against St. Jerome.532THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEdisciple, had besought him, whereas he did not knowGreek, to translate for him into Latin the Epistle ofEpiphanius, forasmuch as it was greatly praised by manyon account of the elegance of language, and as beingthe doctrine of so great a saint. St. Jerome did so, but onlythat Eusebius might enjoy it.The enemies heard ofthis, and sent a wretched little monk to steal the epistle.This he effected, and proceeded to take it to the saidBishop of Jerusalem, who paid him well for it in cash.From this his rivals took occasion to call him falsifier,because he had not translated word by word, and that forhonourable he had put beloved, and other such like things.Jerome then took the opportunity to write his excellentepistle, On the Good Manner of Interpreting, which he sentthe following year to his friend Pammachius, this being inthe year 395, and the fifteenth of the Emperor Theodosius,as is proved from the great eclipse of the sun, of whichSt. Jerome makes mention as being noticed by theauthors of the Ecclesiastical History. He also declares inthat epistle that all these falsehoods and snares of Johnof Jerusalem sprang from the cleverness of Rufinus and ofMelania, his teachers, from whom he had purchased at agreat price his ignorance; and would that they had nottaught him anything, which would have been better forhim, for all he learnt from them was to pass from the sectof the Macedonians to the errors of Origen.Here let uspause and consider, and not without tears, who were thechief adversaries of Jerome, and the patrons of the errorsof Origen, and of this Bishop John, Rufinus, and Melania,those whom at one time he had so greatly loved, hadLet the epistleso praised and held in such high esteem.of the saintly doctor, written to the said Rufinus fromthe desert of Syria, be read through"; and all the reasonEpist. 41.DISPUTES WITH THE BISHOP OF JERUSALEM533for the enmity was in poor Rufinus quitting the side of theholy doctor, because he then fell into the errors of Origen;and being made captain and the defender of them, he, as aconsequence, became the cruel enemy of Jerome, who wasthe chieftain of the Church. Among the number of thechief defenders of Origen, St. Epiphanius names in theepistle the Bishop of Jerusalem, and says the followingwords: “May God deliver you, my brother, and the holypeople under your charge, and all the brethren who arewith you, more especially Rufinus, the priest, from theheresy of Origen and the others, and his perdition andloss.”And what further makes the heart ache is thesad fall of Melania, that illustrious widow, the pattern ofRoman matrons, the honour of Christianity and livingexample of Christian philosophy—she whom Jerome judgednot unworthy to be compared to St. Thecla. And just whenshe was setting out with fleetest wind, her decks loadedwith most precious merchandise, and in full sail was aboutto take port, she struck upon the port of Alexandria, and waswrecked in the quicksands of the errors of Origen; learned,well instructed in the school of Didymus and Rufinus; andfrom Noemi was changed to Mara, from Thecla into Melania,this hapless name signifying the sad ending which such alofty flight was to have. And who that turns his eyesto gaze on Didymus can withhold his flow of tears?Forof the sightless eyes of so enlightened a man did the greatFather Anthony feel envious, if he had those of the soulso clear and lucid as Didymus had, whom Jeromedid not disdain to call master, and to whom he gavethe surname which is only due to the prophets, callinghim Didymus, my seer; and that subsequently he shouldcome down to be more blind in his soul than in the body,is this not a subject to be felt and wept over? He leftEpist. 60 in Operibus D. Hieron.534THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe high road, he departed from the doctrine of theChurch, swayed overmuch by his love of Origen; and theseed which that hapless genius laid was tended andfostered to his loss, and brought forth by his disciplesEvagrius, Isidorus, Rufinus, and Palladius, out of whichwere engendered so many serpents and basilisks that nosmall pestilence was spread in the Church by these mostpernicious doctrines. Of the hapless Didymus nought hasremained in the Church (despite he wrote much) but thebooks Of the Holy Ghost, which the great Father Jerometranslated, and those upon the canonical Epistles: all elseperished miserably. And lest any one should be mistaken,it is well to notice that during that same period there wasanother Didymus, a monk of great sanctity, of whomEvagrius tells us” he trod under foot scorpions and aspsas though they were no more than worms and ants.Mention is also made of this Didymus by Socrates” in hishistory, who adds that he reached the age of ninety-fiveyears. From all this will be comprehended with what spiritand animus do Palladius" and Evagrius speak of Jerome,when occasion offers, and always as being an adversarythey say the worst they can, and to the contrary laudRufinus and Melania to the very heavens.Let this bestated here for our example, that we may open our eyes soas not to trust genius or sanctity, when in a single pointeither one or other withdraws from the doctrine of theuniversal Church and her traditions; since this was thecause of irremediably imperilling persons who were renowned in both qualifications, who had attained such loftybeginnings, and had such miserable ends.Evagr., De vita SS.Socrat., lib. iv. cap. 18.Pallad., in Evagrio.DISCOURSE THE NIN THDisputes arise between our holy Doctor, St. Jerome, andRufinus.Causes of the same.WE have seen what were the dissensions between Jeromeand John of Jerusalem, and also whence they sprang; nowwe shall proceed to declare those which arose betweenJerome and Rufinus.Well might our saint have quoted the proverb, whichsprung up rather from the ingratitude of Aristotle thanfrom reason: “A friend isPlato, but Truth is evengreater.”Rufinus is a friend, but what touches faithconcerns a higher consideration, for it has a deeper root.Jerome we have heard declare that he would tear asunder,should he hear anything against the faith from his ownfather and mother, their very mouths. The devil will notleave in peace the grey hairs of our saintly doctor, and nomore does the learned doctor leave the devil in peace, butwages a continual warfare on him and his followers.As we have seen, Jerome had discovered the venom andpoison of evil doctrines which John was scattering broadcastin the East, and to the West he sent a warning in regardto this bad process. He had fully comprehended that thesesnares had had their rise in the cleverness of Rufinusand in that of Melania, and these in their turn had imbibedThen began to bethem from the hapless Didymus.535536THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEsevered that great friendship, and Theophilus, the patriarchof Alexandria, made an attempt to patch it up and heal thebreach, because between two individuals of such renownthe breach would be acutely felt. The friendship was insome way renewed, but the wound remained unhealed,forasmuch as in both parties the wound had reached theRufinus had seared intovery bone at the first encounters.his very soul the doctrine of Origen, Jerome that of theRoman church; therefore first would heaven be unitedto hell before the breach should be healed.It is vainto mend the roof, if the foundation of the edifice beat fault.Peace thus having been attempted merely on the surface,as I have said, and the works of John of Jerusalem condemned in silence, and those of Origen placed under thesame sentence, Rufinus, whose malice was carrying him frombad to worse, wished to come to land, turning his face back,like Lot's wife. He judged to go first to Rome, and so asnot to go empty of the traffic of Alexandria he loaded hisship with the merchandise and wares he had acquired,carrying the doctrine and perverse dogmas of Origen andDidymus very carefully, in order to establish his businesswith them at least in Rome.He arrived there, andwhereas the mind of man is so variable, eager fornovelty, and knowing good and evil ever since thatfirst lesson in order to be esteemed as God, he opened hisshop, and there were not wanting those who with thesame desire took delight in his wares.In the first book”of the Invectives against our saint he narrates thissame thing of himself. He makes up a dream of Macarius,a friend of his, and says that, when composing a treatiseagainst fate, doubting some points which had occurred tohim in respect to Divine providence, God manifested toLib. 1, Invectiv. in cap. Hieron., Paulus à princ.DISPUTES WITH RUFINUS537him in dreams a ship coming from very far on the sea,and it was revealed to him that on that vessel comingto port he would be delivered of his difficulties.Macariusawoke, and pondering deeply on this vision, the shiparrived which brought Rufinus on board. On enteringthat port, and at once seeking him and conversing withhim, Macarius recounted to him his vision, and gave himan account of his doubts, and in the discussion asked himwhat were the sentiments of Origen on the subjects heMacarius had done wrong inhad proposed to him.telling him of revelations that the ship would free him ofhis doubts, in seeking aught else, and in troubling aboutwhat Origen felt, unless we should say that Macariusdid not understand that no other merchandise had comein that ship but the doctrine of Origen.And so ithappened; the whole colloquy ended in Macarius beseeching him at all hazards to translate from the Greek intoLatin the Periarchon, which means De principiis, becausefrom that original had been drawn out the chief thingsUrged by thewhich had been replied to his doubts.pleadings of his friend, Rufinus actually did so, andpromised in a preface he wrote to the translation to followthe manner pursued by St. Jerome when translating,"which was to remove all that was not in harmony with thepurity of the Faith, in order that none of the errors whichexisted in the Greek should be read in the Latin version,and so skilfully that in Origen himself no opposition shouldbe detected between the texts.For if any be found ofthis in his books, more especially in what touches themystery of the Trinity, different from what in another parthe had defined piously and in the Catholic sense, he wouldhave hushed it up as spurious and contradictory, or wouldRufinus here praises Jerome very much: of course, in a false way, as he discoveredlater on.538THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEset it according towhatever rule he found more often affirmedIn a short time the pernicious doctrineby Origen himself.It fell into the hands ofof Rufinus was sown in Rome.many, with the result that it caused a great scandal amongthe learned and the well-intentioned. At that juncture theapostolic chair was governed by Pope Siricius, successorto St. Damasus, and he was at the time in the ninthyear of his pontificate.Siricius was a man of good intentions, but not of letters. To him Rufinus feigned tobe very catholic, a very devoted son, while beneath thiscloak he was disseminating the pestilential doctrine of hisPeriarchon, without the Pope becoming aware of thedeceit; although this lasted longer than was in reason,because Pope Siricius held the chair little less than sixteenyears, and the disseminating of these errors lasted overfour years.To Pope Siricius succeeded Anastasius, who veryquickly comprehended the malice and the wretcheddoctrines which Rufinus was scattering.Here, in passing,it will be opportune to declare what the holy matronMarcella, the great disciple of Jerome, did at the time.Marcella was held in high repute in Rome by reason ofbirth, sanctity, great prudence, and the deep knowledgeshe had acquired in the school of so great a doctor.Marcella was the first who in Rome manifested the truemeaning of the widowhood spoken of by St. Paul, thatholy state which he declared could properly be calledwidowhood, and she also later on taught what was thetrue religion, for up to that time the holy state had beenheld in contempt. At this epoch there still existed manyrelics of former paganism.Together with the doctrineand teaching of Jerome this holy matron had imbibed thespirit and zeal of her master. No sooner did this book ofRufinus with the doctrine of Origen begin to be disseminDISPUTES WITH RUFINUS539ated and reached the ears of Marcella than, perceiving thatit would do the evil recounted in the parable of the cocklewhich was sown broadcast over the wheat, and, putting asidethe timidity of her sex, she courageously opposed openlythese doctrines, and (silencing the priests) she so prevailedand convinced Pope Anastasius that he rose up in alarm indefence of religion and of faith, and all who were wellintentioned became awakened at the war-cry of this bravewoman, and, rising up, they turned to religion and the faithand sound doctrine. Rufinus and his followers, finding theaffair was in truth becoming developed, and that it was nolonger safe to continue in Rome, decided to depart, striving,however, to carry with them a certificate and some testimony that they had confessed themselves to be sons of theChurch. But Marcella did not rest here; nor did she consider the affair safe. She accused them of being heretics,and brought forward witnesses from among their discipleswho acknowledged their errors, and said they had beendeceived by these heretics.Then the Pope summonedthem, so it is said, by criers, and by letters ordered themto come; but they dared not come, and from fear allowedthemselves to be condemned in their absence.Thesewords are nearly the same as those in which St. Jeromestates the fact when writing the funeral oration' of thesaint, which he addressed to the virgin Principia, who wasa staunch daughter and faithful companion of Marcella. Atthis juncture John, the Bishop of Jerusalem, wrote a letterto Pope Anastasius in praise of Rufinus, favouring him andsanctioning what he did, raising him to the highestAnastasius, like one who quite understoodheavens.this, replied in a vein far from what John expectedor liked.And whereas this affair is a point of importance in1 Epist. 16.54oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthese disputes, I will here insert some clauses of thisreply.

Therefore, dearest brother, cast from you all suspicion, andunderstand that [Rufinus] very much after his own way ofthinking translated from Greek into Latin what Origen hadsaid and approved it. And the man is not very dissimilar542THE LIFE OF ST.

Marcel., et Epist. 8 and 3 lib. In Rufin.DISPUTES WITH RUFINUS543has been given by the Church, and the truth is patent toall the world.At the juncture when the translation was published,and, as we have seen, it met with an adverse criticism, aswas in reason, the heretics fled away, and the errorswere condemned; the friends of our doctor, for he hadmany, as soon as they saw the preface to the bad book, thecraft with which Rufinus publishes in it that Jerome wasan Origenist, in order the better to involve him in hisown crime, and even that he was the master, the commonexcuse of the friends of Rufinus being to say that “so hadJerome said”—they sent information of all that passed tothe holy man, bidding him understand that his honour wasin great danger, and his reputation much imperilled inmatters of the faith; moreover, that most people considered him to be an Origenist, and therefore that, thecase being so grave, it was needful that he (Jerome) shouldcome forward and answer for himself, and so be exoneratedfrom so serious a calumny. Among those who wrote tohim were Pammachius and Oceanus, and they did so inthis manner:* “A certain brother came to us, and showedto us some folios, which contained a translation into Latinof the books of Origen, entitled Periarchon; and forasmuch as in these pages there were many things to disturbour weak intelligence, and which appear to us not expressed in a safe or wholesome way, we have a suspicionthat the author, to excuse himself, has omitted wordswhich would clearly have revealed his small faith. Webeseech of your charity to undertake this labour, not somuch for our advantage as for the good purpose of clearingup the doubts which arise in the minds of those dwelling inthis city, and that you translate the book of Origen faithfully, in the self-same way he wrote it, and manifest what hisEpist. 64.544THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEdefender has added, and that you discover whatever in thesepapers we are sending your eminence you find deviatesfrom the rule of the Catholic faith, or what may be indisMostcreetly expressed we pray you you refute and undo.certainly in the preface to this work, without naming you,he says that he brings to the light a certain work you hadpromised, and assumes cautiously and hints that you areof the same manner of mind—hence, pray undo this, allaythe suspicions of men, and convince those who would fainlay the crime to you, because by dissimulating it wouldappear that you are consenting.”"To this letter St. Jerome replied, since he could notdo otherwise, by manifesting the aim he had always hadwhen reading and lauding Origen, pointing out the textwhere he does so; adding that he had never held him tobe a man who taught sound doctrine, although he esteemedhim as one who had expounded with much genius somegreat things of the holy Scriptures. “I have,” he says,“praised the genius, but not the faith in him; he is a goodIn order the better tophilosopher, but not an apostle.”disclose all that is felt on Origen, he subsequently showsmost of his errors and heresies one by one.And, whereasRufinus tries to prove that the errors of the books ofOrigen were not his, but those of envious men and hereticswho had scattered them in these books, Jerome proceedsto prove this statement to be false, because Eusebius andDidymus, both being learned men and followers and greatdefenders of Origen, never gave such a solution: ratherEusebius writes his apologetic books, in which he showsthat it was thus he had felt, and in this manner had hewritten them; whilst Didymus in such wise excuseshis errors that he confesses them to be his also, and seeksto condense them with his genius. “What an extraordinaryEpist. 64.DISPUTES WITH RUFINUS545act this is !” he says, nearly at the end of the epistle, “thatno other books could have been falsified in all the worldbut those of Origen, and as though at the bidding ofMithridates the truth could have been eradicated fromhis books! How could this be?” Although one or otherof his books should have been tampered with, yet notall his works, and this throughout the world, these worksbeing composed at diverse times and places! Even Origenhimself, in an epistle written to Pope Fabian, does penancefor having written such like things, and casts the blame onAmbrose, saying that what he had dictated in secret hehad made public.In the rest of the epistle St. Jeromedeclares conclusively that never did St. Pamphilius, martyr,write the book which Rufinus published in defence ofOrigen, and concludes by saying: “I have thus replied asearly as I could, beloved brothers, to your epistle, doingwhat is very much against my wish, that is to say, writingagainst one whose genius I had always admired, wishingrather that my reputation should suffer, but not my faith.In this strait have my friends placed me: If I hold mypeace, I am guilty; while, if I reply, I am put down asan enemy. A hard line this is !But of two evils Ichose the lesser, because a friendship that is severedmay be made up, while blasphemy does not deservepardon.”On the reply arriving in Rome it was made known toRufinus, who wrote to the saintly doctor in a somewhatresentful spirit, yet beseeching him not to sever the friendship between them which had been restored. Jerome atonce answered by a brief epistle, declaring that he haddone no more than clear himself of the crime imputed tohim and the stigma attached of being called an Origenist,and that with all care he had in his reply guarded againstin any way touching him, or pointing him out; that he2 N546THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEcalled our Lord to witness that, after friendship had beenreinstated, he had retained no ill-will; that he had perceivedclearly that what he had said in the preface to his translation of the book Periarchon touched him to the quick, butnevertheless he would not decide in what spirit it hadbeen penned.Only one thing does he beseech him: that,if he pleases to follow the doctrine of Origen, or of anyother, to do as best pleases him, but not to involve him init, because, if what he follows be good, he has no need ofany outside help, and if it be evil, despite that many mightpraise it, this would not excuse him. “And it would bevery prudent in you and yours,” he adds at the end of theletter, “not to afford an occasion to those who are resentful—since you might find others possibly not so easy as I am—to take pleasure in false praises.”As the wretched Rufinus and his adherents perceivedthat in Rome his cause was viewed so suspiciously, andthat with the explanation of the errors of Origen whichJerome had made manifest in the new translation of theAeriarchon the cause of Rufinus had become so discredited,all his efforts and that of his adherents were concentratedin discrediting Jerome, saying evil things of him in corners,and spreading libels. Then Rufinus wrote an Apologia inhis own defence, and in doing this he finished revealinghis wretched heart.Ere the pages of this Apologia had reached the handsof Jerome, he had already by letters become acquaintedwith what had passed, and the evil things which Rufinusand his satellites had scattered, and still were scattering,In these letters the friends of our saint greatlyabout him.importuned him to answer for himself, because Rufinuswas not so bereft, nor so fallen, but that the former influenceof Pope Siricius, who at that juncture had been dead but ashort time, yet had power to sustain his reputation; and,DISPUTES WITH RUFINUS547although Pope Anastasius had known him, the cause wasnot yet so plain but that many judged Jerome to be anOrigenist, and that, if there was anything of him in Rufinus,it was from Jerome he had imbibed it, whom he followedin all things—at least so he professed to say outwardly—as his master and especial friend. To prove this theypointed to epistles and treatises of Jerome's wherein hegreatly praised Origen.They showed the translationswhich he had made of his works, and how he prided himself on being a disciple of Didymus, who had drank in thespirit of Origen.Such haste did they make, and suchpressure did they bring to bear on the holy doctor, andsuch force of zeal was his for the faith, and so keenly didhe feel being thus pointed at in this affair, that he decidedto break silence, and not imperil all that up to that timehe had laboured for, and esteeming naught the pretendedfriendship which Rufinus had kept up with him, being intruth his capital enemy, he took up the pen, and bringing to bear his former valour, power, and elegance ofdiction, he openly wrote against Rufinus that most famousbook of his Apologia.This work he divided into threebooks.In the first he replies to the calumnies and maliciousthings which Rufinus was publishing against him; in thesecond he replies to the invective which Rufinus wroteagainst him, under the title of Apologia and Defence,forwarded to Pope Anastasius; in the third he replies toan epistle of the selfsame Rufinus, in which he pretendedto excuse himself with St. Jerome.It is the commonopinion of all learned men that here Jerome manifests hisgreat genius, a singular vivacity, great fecundity, and deeperudition; and, when these books were published, there wasclearly seen the great advantage he had over Rufinus, anadvantage compared only to that of a giant over a dwarf.In argument, and in establishing reason, he revealed all548THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe keenness which could be desired, while in regard tothe replies, and in turning back of arguments to the discomfiture of his enemy, his subtlety and wit is very noteworthy, as well as the ease with which he gives such variedturns to the discourse. He is both sarcastic and ironicalwith his adversary; he discovers his mind and malice withsuch wit and elegance of diction that it is difficult to putdown the book before reaching the end.And, althoughthe subject of apologies and invectives be so ungrateful atheme to handle for pure and pious ears, yet he so well expresses and seasons his discourse, imparting such zest thatthe most devout and prudent find something to entertainthem in a holy manner amidst so much that is hard andAs this cause is one which is of faith, and inrough.defence of so saintly a name as that of Jerome, whichRufinus with such malice had essayed to vilify, it is gratifying to see truth brought forth and revealed, and innocencevictorious, falsehood unmasked, malice undone, and liesproved.Whoever carefully reads these Apologies willbehold Rufinus unmasked, and will wonder at the daringof so common an individual pitting himself against soillustrious an intellect. And one of the things which to mehas been a subject of deep thought, is that of how a personof such exalted sanctity, of such deep learning, and of sohigh and noble a lineage as was Jerome could have sufferedthe company and friendship of a man with so low a mindI can onlyand bad heart and so untruthful as was Rufinus?explain this by believing that Jerome, despite that he knewall his defects, yet bore with him so patiently in order toexercise himself in suffering, and thus bear the fault of hisbrother on his own shoulders.There are many noteworthythings to be discovered in these Apologies which I mightquote, in order to prove the opinion I have stated.I willonly touch upon one or two sentences, which are to theDISPUTES WITH RUFINUS549purpose of this history, and for the better understandingof the cause.Among other errors of Origen, and which it appearsmore greatly had attracted and captivated Rufinus, was theone on the origin of souls, which, as we have seen in thedisputes with John of Jerusalem—for they were all ofthe same mind—he had said had been created previous tothe bodies, and on account of sin had been imprisoned inthem.In order to free himself of this error, Rufinus, whowas well initiated in this error, says in his Apologia whichhe wrote to Anastasius (which was an invective againstJerome), these words: “If in this part I am questioned asto what I feel, I confess that I have read many thingsin divers authors.In some I have read that in thesame way as bodies, by the succession of progenitors, beThis theycome engendered, so also it occurs with souls.confirm by what reasons they can bring forward.This,I believe, among the Latins is maintained by Tertullian orThere areLactantius, and perchance by some others.others who believe that at the point when the body isformed in the womb, God day by day creates the soul, andinfuses it into the body.Others again affirm that the soulswere created first, when God out of nothing created allthings, and that now by His judgment He separates andThis isdisposes that they shall be born in the bodies.But aswhat Origen thinks, and some other of the Greeks.for myself (and I call God as a witness), although I haveread all up to the present point, I have not resolvedanything of this question; but I leave it to God to know,or to whomsoever He should be pleased to reveal it.Iconfess I know not, and no more than what the Churchteaches, that God is the Creator of both souls and bodies.”Apol. in Rufin, lib. ii. c. 2.55oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMETo this our saint replies, treating this discourse veryaptly; and after remarking upon the rudeness of theindividual, the confused narration, and the grossness ofthe manner of speech, he says as follows: “I am wellaware that among Christians it is unusual to reprehendthe vice and defect of words, but it was my wish in thissmall portion to show that it is great daring to teach thatwhich you do not know, and to write that which youignore, in order that we should from this understand asimilar prudence in the sense and in the thing. He sendsan epistle, which he calls most powerful, and a strongstaff, with which the Bishop of Rome may arm himself, andthe same question, over which the dogs are barking, hesays he does not know, nor has he attained what is asked,yet disputes it.If he does not know upon what thecause hinges, what need has he to send an apology, inwhich his defence is not written, but only the confessionof his ignorance?This is not to extinguish or allay thesuspicions of men, but to further stir them up. He quotesthree opinions upon the state of the souls, and concludessaying: I have read all, I do not deny it, yet I confess thatI am still ignorant. He is like Arcesilas or Carneades,who say that it is all uncertain: all is placed in doubt,Thesealthough in being cautious he exceeds them.others, unable to endure the envy of all the other philosophers, would fain take away truth, even life itself, andthey came to accept the terms likely, probable, and apparent,to temper their ignorance by probability.This one alsosays he is uncertain, and of these three sentences he knowsIf he had to reply in thisnot which contains the truth.wise, what reason urged him to call as a witness so greata Pontiff?” Then farther down he says, “Of the Father,of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, of the nativity of theSaviour (of whom Isaias says, His generation, who canDISPUTES WITH RUFINUS551number it 2) he speaks without fear; and the mystery ofthe ancient years so long unknown does not escape hisscience, and only does he not know that of which his ignorance has been the chief scandal. He knows how the Virginconceives the Son, and yet does not know how He Himselfwas born. He confesses God to be the Creator of soulsand of bodies. Whether the souls were created beforethe bodies, whether born together, or after the bodies weremade the soul was infused into them, under any form weacknowledge God as the Author, though the question benot whether God or any other made them, but of all thesethree opinions he does not know which is the true one.But be warned lest the retort on you be that for thisreason you confess your ignorance of the three, lest yoube forced to condemn the one, and that you pardon Lactantius and Tertullian for not having strangled Origen.As far as I remember, unless I am mistaken, I do notthink I have read in Lactantius that the soul is thus translated (so to say), or that it is enwrapped in the principleBut you, who write thatwhence the body is produced.you have thus read, tell me in what book, so as not toappear that just as you calumniate me whilst asleep,you do so to the other, who is dead.Even in this it isdoubtful, and proceed with caution. You say, I think thatamong the Latins Tertullian and Lactantius, and perchanceeven some others.Not only do you doubt the state ofsouls, but you suspect the authors, although with somedifference, because as to the souls you clearly confess yourignorance, but of the authors you state that you do know,and that you incline rather to suspicion than to presumption.It is only of Origen that you have no doubts,since you state plainly, Thus does Origen think. Now I askyou, Does he think well or evilly? No doubt you will say,I know not. Why, then, do you hasten so to teach me by552THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEposts and messengers, and then to inform me that you donot know? And lest, perchance, I should not credit yourignorance, and might think you cleverly keep silent thatwhich you know, you swear, taking God as your witness,that up to the present you have not on this point anythingestablished or certain, and you leave to God whatever bethe truth, or to whomsoever He should be pleased to reveal it. What do you suppose then that after so manycenturies no one has been found worthy enough, to whomNeither toGod could have revealed this difficulty ?patriarch nor to prophet, nor apostle or martyr, not evento yourself, when you were enduring exile and were inprisons, were these sacraments revealed?"In the Gospelour Lord says, Father, Thy name I have made known tomen.Did He then who revealed and manifested theFather keep silence as to souls? And still you marvelthat against you should arise scandals among the brethren,when you declare on oath that you know not what theChurch of Christ confesses she does know.”In thismanner does Jerome proceed with wit and skill; but muchis lost in the depth of the original by reason of the fettersof translation.Although to comprehend the spirit of Rufinus and theadequate reputation of the great doctor what has beensaid suffices, nevertheless I wish to insert out of the manycalumnies and malicious assertions one which he inventedagainst the glorious Father, which, on account of itsgravity and impudence, may serve to gauge what therest were.He raised up against our saint the letterwhich purported to have been written by Pope St.Anastasius (of which we have transcribed a portion above),This he says because Rufinus vaunted having suffered exile and prisons for thefaith in Alexandria, which was all fiction; because during the time he was there in thatcity no persecution took place, nor was there a persecutor, for since the death of Julianno prince had there been who persecuted the faithful.DISPUTES WITH RUFINUS553but which was not belonging to Anastasius but his own,and he had forged the name of the Pope, pointing him outas a liar and falsifier.It pleased God that Jerome shouldsuffer so great an affront from one who had formerly professed to be so dear a friend. The saint replies to thiscalumny, and says: “In regard to the Epistle of the holyPope Anastasius you were obscure, confused, and agitated,and you found nowhere to stand. At times you say it wascomposed by me; now you say it should have been sentfrom him to you; at other times you argue and point outthe author of it as unjust, whether written by the Pope ornot; you declare you care not anything, because you holdsufficient testimony from his predecessor; and that, whenRome besought you to honour her with your presence,you esteemed it as nought through love of your hamlet.If you suspect the letter to be a forgery of mine, why doyou not seek for it in the archives of Rome, where allletters are preserved? And on finding that it had notbeen sent off by the bishop, you could apprehend thetrapsculpritor snares, strangle me in the strong net and noose.And if in effect it came from the Roman Pontiff, youact foolishly in demanding the original of the man towhom it was not sent, and not of him who sent it, andawait that from the East there should come the testimonyconcerning which you have so close at hand the author andIt will be better for you to proceed to Rome,the witness.and ask him face to face, why did he aggrieve you so muchduring your absence, being innocent? The first in notreceiving the profession of your faith approved by all Italy,and for not wishing to use the staff of your letter againstthe dogs; and secondly, why forward letters against youto the East without your knowledge, and brand you withthe stamp of heretic, saying that you have translated themanifest crime, and without settingin554THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEbooks of the Periarchon of Origen, and published themamid the simple people of the Church of Rome thatthereby through you they should lose the pure faith whichthey had learned from the apostles; and to injure you,make you to have said of the Commentaries a thousandevil things, when you with your Preface had strengthenedIt is not a slight matter that the Pontiff of sothem.great a city publishes of you, or that which without causehe admits, said or suborned by another; and he utterswith loud voice, and cries along the streets and marketplaces, It is not mine that book, and if it be mine, it wasEusebius who stole my rough sheets without having beencorrected.I wrote it in quite another manner, and I saymore I did not write it; I gave it to no one, or I gave itto few; and my enemy was so wicked, and so careless weremy friends, that together they falsified the originals.”"St. Jerome here touches upon another wicked act ofRufinus by this elegant insinuation and irony. He hadsaid that Eusebius of Cremona, a disciple of St. Jerome,who at the juncture was in Rome, had stolen all theoriginals, and falsified them from the translation he hadmade of Origen.It is against this falsehood that thesaintly doctor says these words, mocking his want ofshame, and continues: “This counsel which I have givenyou is what you should follow, beloved brother, and notturn your back on the Pope and cast at me, despitethat I am on the other side of the sea, the arrows of yourmalice. What profit will it bring to your own woundsthat I also should be wounded ?Is it perchance a consolation to the wounded friend to see his friend dying byhis sideYou show the epistle of the dead Pope Siricius;and as to Anastasius, who is still living, you hold in smallFarther on he adds: “Grantedregard his utterances.”In Riyin. lib. iii. c. 3.DISPUTES WITH RUFINUS555that last year I should have forged the epistle; but thisone, only recently written, who sent it to the East?Init Pope Anastasius adorns you with so many flowers thatwhen you come to read it you will be more inclined tobegin defending yourself than accusing me.”Let what has been said suffice to record the sanguinarybattle; for it would be a long affair and of small profit toreveal more of the wretched things concerning Rufinus,together with threats of banishment levelled at him, andother mean things, which he resorts to against St. Jerome.In truth it is no small testimony to his sanctity that,having lived in the company of this man in all simplicityhe should turn into his bitterest enemy, and find nothingto take up against him during the course of his life, hisstudies, conversation, and journeys but absurd puerilethings.It is well he should form an evil conception ofour saint, having said that he had read the Eisagoge ofPorphyrius, and so from this he should deem proper to saywitty things, but they are very clear specimens of hisSimilarly does he attack him onexceedingly low mind.the subject of his studies of the Hebrew language, and thetranslations which were brought to him by young men, andwhich he showed him, these youths coming to him fromall parts, in order that in his company and by his ownhand they should learn religion, letters, sanctity, and goodcustoms; yet out of all this which was so good and saintly,and bearing such heavenly profit, he draws forth venomand says a hundred evil things.Here is made manifestwhat hurt accrues to men of mind and genius to meet withevil companions and ordinary minds corrupted in faith orin good customs.So long as Rufinus remained in thecompany of Jerome no evil came to him; he studied, helearned and profited within the limits of his capacity withoutHe withdrew from him,stumbling in matters of faith.556THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEand unhappily for his damage he went to Alexandria. Hemet a genius such as Didymus was. As Rufinus knewbut little, and must have been vainglorious, and found inthis new vessel such extraordinary things, he had alsoambition to gain repute, vainglory being a stumbling-blockagainst which many have been wrecked.Little by littleDidymus gave him his poison to drink, filled him withdogmas of Origen and a few of his own not very good.Then he found he could lead him here and there as hepleased, by reason of the want of strength in his character,and finding no resistance offered.Didymus could not actthus with Jerome, nor did he attempt it; or, if he didattempt such a thing, he very soon found he could notsucceed, because the power he had to attack was a verydifferent one to that of Rufinus. After the contests Rufinushad with our saint he never, so to say, lifted up his head;his small capacity and the great mischief he had wroughtin the minds of the simple became apparent, and peoplebegan to withdraw from him, until at last both he and hisaffairs became put away and buried in the abyss whereinothers equally suspicious had fallen.The benefit that accrued from these disputes andencounters was the fact that through them our saint wasthereby forced to afford us some light concerning his owndoings, because the greater part which has appeared ofthem in this history has been drawn from these Apologiae.Thus do a thousand advantages accrue to saints from thepersecution of enemies.DISCOURSE THE TENTHDeath of the saintly Matron, Paula.THREE events of great moment presented themselves tothe holy Father, St. Jerome, at the time when advancingage was bringing him to the last period of man's life—the seventh one, the period of decrepitude. The first ofthese said events was the period already stated of hisdissensions with Rufinus, a sequel sprung from thosewhich had taken place with John of Jerusalem. And, forasmuch as these dissensions were with one who for so long atime had been in closest friendship, they proved a subjectof deepest regret to him, and also because these dissensionswere on subjects of profound gravity, and which could notbe reconciled, as the saint himself expresses it in the concluding words of the Apologia of Rufinus, but by an equalcomprehension of the questions of faith—a thing whichRufinus could hardly be made to arrive at, since he hadfor so long a time been imbibing the evil doctrines ofOrigen.The second event and bitter trial was the death ofSt. Paula, of which we shall treat in this discourse. Thethird event was the dispute which arose with the gloriousFather of the Church, St. Augustine.And, althoughthese three events occurred almost at the same time, yetthe severance with Rufinus was the first ; that of St.557558THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEto thearrivingslowly, dueAugustine came second, and was of long duration, owingto the epistles which passed between the two learneddoctorsgreat distanceintervening between their respective dwelling-places, aswe shall see by these very letters. And in the midst ofthese contentions occurred the death of this most saintlywoman, as appears from an epistle" by our saint to St.Augustine, in which he excuses himself for his delay inreplying to his letters, owing to his many occupationsI have wishedbrought about by the long illness of Paula.to separate these events, and assign a discourse to each,in order to be able to consider each by itself in themost approved order.Hence I have treated firstly theseverance of Rufinus from the faith, and his breach withJerome.shall treat ofthe glorious death of our holy matron, and leave for athird discourse (because of its enduring the longest) thecontention between Augustine and Jerome, and its happytermination.Secondly, in this discourse IIt pleased our Lord, the better to refine perfectly thegold of the life of the saintly Paula, to send her a longillness which should end with her death, and wherein shouldbe made manifest the patience and heroic endurance ofIn hernot only a Roman woman, but of a Christian.breast there was awakened with a greater power than shehad ever experienced during her whole life most vividyearnings for that sovereign country above, which such asdo not desire it are unworthy to possess. A burningfever attacked and reduced her to a skeleton, but converted Paula into a phoenix, which, while consumingher, released her from mortal coils the better to takeher flight to heaven. Her whole solace was to conversewith Jerome, who in her exile had been a fellow-worker,Epist. 91.DEATH OF PAULA559the counsellor and the faithful recipient of her piousdesires.It is not indeed a small dignity conferred onPaula to have had such a friend near at hand at the endof her earthly pilgrimage to give the last blessing at thesupreme moment.It is recorded that daily they conferredon spiritual things, and often during her illness did theyrecite the divine office together. Her daughter Eustochium attended on her mother continually.Paula's wholedesire was to see the end of her pilgrimage on earth; butto Jerome the loss was very great, as well as to all the holymonks and virgins who prayed by day and by night aroundher. The wealth she had possessed she had long agodespised for Christ's sake, and had divided it among thepoor, in founding monasteries, in sheltering pilgrims, andin succouring orphans; the inheritance due to Eustochiumwas inherited by the poor, for she, like her mother, hadBut as itembraced poverty as a precious inheritance.would be beyond me to write worthily of this saintlywoman, let us rather listen to the words of Jerome, whowas himself the faithful witness of her most happy death.Writing to St. Augustine he tells him: “The principalcause of my delay in replying to you has been the longillness of the saintly venerable Paula, whom we haveassisted so assiduously that I had nearly forgotten yourletter, or rather his who wrote in your name, bearing inmind that versicle, Out of season is music in time of tears.”And in the epitaph of the same saint, written to console hersaintly daughter, when recounting her death, he says asfollows: “Who can recount without shedding tears thedeath of Saint Paula ? She fell into a grave sickness, or,better said, she found that which she so desired, which wasto leave us, to join in truth more intimately our dear Lord.During her long illness all were witnesses to the love andtenderness which her daughter Eustochium always mani560THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEfested towards her as her mother, never quitting her bedside,attending on and performing all the duties required nightand day, never leaving her but to run to the Cave of theCrib, and there, with tears, sighs, prayers, and supplications,beseeching the Lord not to deprive her of such lovedcompany, and in the event of her mother's death not topermit herself to remain on earth, but to take her also, andboth together be taken and buried.But oh, miserable,fragile nature of man! Did the faith of Christ not raiseus to heaven, and not promise eternity to souls, it wouldseem as though our bodies were involved in the same fateas the ass and other animals. One equal end comes tothe pious and to the impious, to the good as well as to thebad, the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices, tohim who does not sacrifice—that is to say, to him who hasreligion as to him who has it not, the good man like theone who sins, he who swears like the one who fears anoath.Both man and beast return into dust and ashes.Why then do I linger so long, and by the delay increasemy anguish? This most prudent among women felt thatdeath was approaching, and when the various parts of herbody were already turning cold, her heart alone was onfire with the heat of the soul; nevertheless, like to onewho journeys towards her own home, and bids adieu tostrangers, she softly and in a whisper would repeat thatversicle of the Psalm : ‘Lord, I have loved the beauty ofThy house, and the glory of the place of Thy dwelling’; andthat other one: “How worthy of being loved, O Lord ofarmies, are Thy tabernacles / And my soul desireth them.How my spirit longeth for the portals of the Lord /Andon other occasions: ‘I have preferred to be the last atthe porch of the house of the Lord rather than to possessthe palaces of the unjust.And when I would ask herwhy she kept otherwise so silent, why she did not replyDEATH OF PAULA561when asked if she were in pain, she would answer me inthe Greek language that she felt no pain or discomfort,because her eyes already viewed all things calmly in peaceand tranquillity.”Before proceeding with this discourse I will here insertin the midst of the narrative a digression to explain thisThis reply which he tells us Paulaepistle of our saint.pronounced in the Greek language, affords me an infinitepleasure every time I read it, since it is to me the puresttestimony of the sanctity of this holy matron that could beafforded by human language. God leads and brings thosewho persevere to the end in the observance of His holylaw and gospel, and who have journeyed manfully, according to their holy vocation, along the rugged path of thisearthly exile with faith and hope, in obedience and penitence, into such a happy state, that with their own eyesthey see—even before they quit this life and the soulbecomes separated from the body—that the dangerous warfare is over between the old and the new man, betweenappetite and reason, between the members and the spirit;they behold their enemies vanquished, and the greatvictory of Jesus Christ against sin and against death, ofthe first death I say, expecting with a vivid faith the totalvictory over death in body and in soul. They see themselvessons of God, heirs to the kingdom, the perfect fruits ofpenance; they see themselves paid first the daily wage onthe Sabbath of rest, and that they rest from their toils andlabours, like God rested from His works.In a word, theyat length see what many prophets and kings desired tosee, and did not see in this life, and they behold what eyehath not seen, nor ear heard, nor did it enter into theheart of man to conceive; that which is not possible toexpress, nor is it given to human language to speak,known only to such as have attained to it and possess it.2 O562THE LIFE OF ST.

Gowith God, O Paula, and assist with your prayers him whonow in the last period of his old age honours you as wellas he can.

JEROMEOf Eustochium, a pure Virgin.In former timesThe principal and first Lady in Rome, the Great.Later on she followed Christ in His poverty,And in Bethlehem, the Little,She made her dwelling-place.”On the door of the Cave of the Saviour he placedanother inscription, which says as follows:—“Dost thou behold the humble grave on thisWithin lies the body of Paula,Cliff?But her soul dwells amid celestial wealth.She left parents and country, brothers, children,And in the Cave of Bethlehem reposes,Wherein Christ's humble manger stood,And Wise men gave gifts to God and Man.”“The holy and blessed Paula died seven days beforethe kalends of February, being on a Tuesday at sunset.She was laid in her grave on the fifth day before thekalends of the same month. The consuls were HonoriusAugustus, for the sixth time, and Aristenius.After thedeath of her husband, Toxotius, she resided in Rome forfive years as an apostolic widow, and as a religious andsaintly; and in Bethlehem she dwelt for twenty years, thewhole number of the years of her life being fifty-six, eightmonths, and twenty-one days.”All the above up to this time has been of our greatdoctor. In these words he has clearly manifested his greatappreciation of her virtues, his own deep sorrow, the painof heart he himself endured, and the tender affection andreverence he had for one who had been his fellow-workerin his own life.Undoubtedly the death of Paula was acrushing blow to him. As our holy Father does not tellus in what year of our Lord her death took place, nor whowas the Supreme Pontiff at the time, contenting himselfwith the mention of the emperor and consuls, there areDEATH OF PAULA567various opinions as to the exact date of her death.Somesay it took place at the end of the pontificate of Anastasius,before the entry of the Goths into Rome, which, accordingto them, occurred in the year 407 of our Redemption. Theyfurther add that Pope Anastasius did not fill the chair morethan three years and twenty-one days, according to thecommon reckoning. He was succeeded by Innocent, andit was in the eighth year of his pontificate that Alaricentered Rome. This account does not appear very trustClearlyworthy nor correct; rather it is contradictory.do authors agree in setting the death of Anastasius inthe year 400, in the month of April, and it appears thatthose are greatly mistaken who hold that he was livingin the year 407 of our Redemption, and the contradiction is manifest, since to say that in the eighth year ofthe pontificate of Innocent Rome was entered, and thatthis took place in 412, and that Pope Anastasius wasliving in 407, is great negligence, because between sevenand twelve there are not eight but five years. The mostreliable account I believe to be that of Honuphrius, in hisRasti, which places the election of Innocent in the monthof May 401, and this by common consent, and the sixthconsulship of Honorius with Aristenius in that of 404,which was the year in which the glorious Saint Paula died;that is to say, six years before the entry into Rome, as weshall see farther on in its proper place.Others reckondifferently, although with slight difference.” To investigatequestions of years with certainty is a matter of extremedifficulty, and when the difference is not of great momentit is a thankless labour, because frequently it is merelya work of conjecture, and all possible diligence is of1 Marian. Victor, in Vita D. Hieron.Honuphr. Fasti.Genebrand, in Cronolog.568THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEno avail. To seek the origin of so many differences inchronicles belongs to another study.On the death of our holy mother Paula, the virginEustochium, her daughter, remained with the charge ofgoverning those monasteries: poor as she was, pledgedand in debt, as our doctor himself affirms on oath, that isto say, poor as regards worldly goods, because in those ofthe soul she was very rich; endowed with a large charity,unbounded hope, and faith sufficient to support a greaterPoverty of spirit is aarmy with even lesser resources.great treasure; he who has least of earth and is mostbereft is the one who can do most, and he that hathnothing possesses all things.Nihil habentes et omniafossidentes, which in our language cannot be expressedshorter or so strongly.This affair rests upon a powerfulpillar—upon that celestial promise, firmer, more steadfastthan the heavens, since it rests on the foundation ofthe promise of Christ, who came to make known to usthe faith and confidence which we should have in Him.He was not satisfied with telling us that him who shouldleave for His love all earthly things, He would repay ahundredfold, because even here below, in this our presentlife, and in each detail of our life, it is proved as a truth;but He even gave us His royal word that to him whoshould first seek the kingdom of Heaven, and shouldprefer that labour to all others, all things should be addedover and above, as things which do not affect the principal,because if He gives the kingdom who also gave theSon, what will He not give us after that? And thus doesSt. Peter declare, and thus did he prove it, when he sawhis bark and his nets in the exchange of Jesus Christ,exchanged for what had never entered into his mind todesire when he asked what would become of him andhis companions, since they had left all things to followDEATH OF PAULA569Him? Here I would fain allow myself to be carried awayby the consideration and force of this great virtue—avirtue which was so resplendent in Paula and Eustochiumwere I not restrained by remembering that I am not following the office of Preacher, but of Historian, otherwise Iwould along with the children of Israel make a dash tothe desert, and with the same Jesus Christ who replied tothe devil those words of fearless trust with which Mosesreplied to the people'—Not in bread alone doth man live,êut in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God—trusting to it, and executing what He should ordain in thelively faith of which he lives, and is better supported, andrests far more securely than with all the means and richesof the world. And by the same rule did the holy VirginEustochium live and follow, for she inherited from hermother the poverty of Jesus Christ, and remained richerthan had she possessed all the treasures ascribed to Midasand to Croesus.It becomes impossible, in writing thelives of the saints, since they are living sermons, to passover without touching on these things.I firmly believethat to these two holy women there must have occurredadmirable things in this respect.Because in order tosupport so many religious and monks, maintain so manymonasteries of virgins consecrated to God, to keep upso much hospitality, shelter for so many pilgrims, notwithstanding that there was no property, since it hadall been distributed with such a free hand to the poor,I do not know how to explain how it was done without acontinual miracle; I know not what to say on this greatsubject, but to bow the head and leave its solutión to God,for He knows how it is done, and as for myself, haverecourse to the trust so familiar to our saint: “All thingsare possible to him who believes.”Neither can I linger toDeut. viii. 3; Matt. iv. 4.57oTHE LIFE OF ST.

How and why it happens that some ask in this Nameand not others, although in appearance all seem to ask inthe same Name, we shall declare in the future promisedhistory.I have not ventured to write the lives purposelyof these two glorious saints, because it seemed to me thatwhat the holy doctor has told us of both mother anddaughter is of greater depth and advantage than all elsewe could ourselves bring forward.DISCOURSE THE E L EVENTHSerious but pious Controversies arise between St. Jeromeand St. Augustine.The end of these Contentions.IN the encounter which forms the subject matter of thisdiscourse we will find that the victory was not so easy ofattainment as our saint had experienced in all the encountershe had had up to the present.In this case his wrestlingwill not be against a slumbering Vigilantius, nor withHelvidius, the ignorant, nor with Rufinus, the hypocrite, orwith any person of their stamp; but the contest will bewith a clear luminary among the doctors of the Church,indeed with no less a personage than with St. Augustine.It will afford a great pleasure to my readers, to thepious and the learned, to behold in the field two suchillustrious champions, both, as it were, taught by the oneand the same master, and moved by the same spirit; each,nevertheless, defending and combating his own ends, andthus both essaying their skill.The contest will not be brought to a conclusion withaught else than by each champion remaining vanquishedby the other in charity and love, in the bonds and chainsSuch are the contentionsof a perpetual union in Christ.and the differences of the saints; such the fruits Goddraws from them.Let us, therefore, state the case andthe occasion which gave rise to these disputes.57.1572THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMESt. Augustine had a great friend called Alypius. Theyhad been brought up together, and together had beenbaptised.Alypius had a great desire to visit the placesof the Holy Land when Augustine was already a greatFather, and Bishop of Hippo. As the fame of Jeromewas spreading and daily increasing throughout the world,Augustine charged his friend Alypius, when he departedfor the Holy Land, to see and visit Jerome, in order toestablish communications with such a person, of whom somany things were said, both as regards sanctity and letters.On arriving at Bethlehem he visitedAlypius did so.Jerome, and on his part afforded him information in respectto the great sanctity and doctrine of Augustine, and inthis way a correspondence was established between theseAlypius proceeded to Jerusalem.two enlightened men.This occurred in the year 393 of our Redemption.Itappears, as was very possible, that he communicated withJohn, the Bishop of Jerusalem, at the time when the warmdisputes between St. Epiphanius and St. Jerome wereraging on one part, and John of Jerusalem, Rufinus, andMelania on the other, as well as all others who wereinfested with the errors of Origen, against whom the twosaints were waging war.All these found the arrival ofAlypius a favourable occasion for raising strife betweenAugustine and Jerome, since it appeared to them that, ifthese two great men would have an altercation, eitherAugustine would triumph, or at least they would have himon their side, and thus repress the boldness of Jerome,placing him in an unfavourable light, and so he wouldleave them at peace: all these motives did the Origenistsbring together, and hence they plied Alypius with all theevil things they could bring concerning Jerome, and otherswhich they daily said about him. They accused him ofBaronius, tom iv., annal. anno. 393 et 394.CONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE573being a haughty man, full of arrogance, puffed out, whoforgave no one, who blamed every one, who judged noone to be anything in comparison with himself, who judgedhimself learned above all others on earth and in the Church;hence that it would be very much to the service of God torepress his pride and arrogance, that the faithful would bethe gainers if his overbearing character should be madeknown. And if by other erudite writings, and learnedones, he could be made to comprehend that he was not sowise as he deemed himself to be, and be corrected in suchthings as he was not quite accurate, by some wise, learnedman, and of lofty genius (such, for instance, as the worldheld Augustine to be), his arrogance by this means wouldbe put down and bridled, because then they could easilyovercome him.Alypius did not perceive the deceptionthey had practised on him—since it is easy to deceive thegood—but lent an ear to what was said by persons apparently of such renown, name, fame of sanctity, and letters—one of these a bishop of Jerusalem, another, Melania,held in the world as a miracle of grace and learning;Palladius, and others, whom heRufinus,undoubtedly believed were moved by holy zeal.Andwho would not have credited them?Alypius thus returned to Africa with his heart full of what he had heard,and reported to St. Augustine all that he had learnt. Thegreat doctor took in all that was said in the same manner,because Alypius was esteemed by him very highly, and heheld his opinion as of weight, and therefore that his information was truth itself.Alypius had brought away withhim the book St. Jerome had written–De Viris illustribus.St. Augustine read through this work, and was greatlypleased with the genius of Jerome. Without doubt he wasshown other writings, and the studies and labours of the greatdoctor in translating the sacred books from the HebrewEvagrius,574THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEinto Latin described to him by Alypius. Moved by all hehad heard and seen, the great Father St. Augustine wasminded to send a letter to Jerome by the hand of Profuin which he commences by saying as follows:turus,“Never did a person know another so well by countenance as I have you before me represented by your saintlyoccupations, your holy and deep studies and exercises inthe Lord.Although I greatly desire to know you personally, nevertheless I have the presentment of yourself beforeme, which is little less than a bodily presence; becauseafter you were seen by him who is now bishop, and at thetime was even then well worthy of being one—I meanthe beloved Alypius—on his return to me now with thereport he brought me, I cannot deny that your formhas remained impressed on my mind in a great measure;and even before he returned, when he was beholding you,I also was seeing you with his own eyes, for he and Iare only bodily two beings, as in soul we are but one.This must be understood in the will and common friendship and intercourse, because in merits he was greatly mysuperior.”In the rest of the epistle, which would be too long toreproduce here, after he manifests the desire he has ofcommunicating with him, and treating on learned subjects,he beseeches him on his part, and for the common desireof all Africans, to occupy himself in translating what theGreek doctors have written on the sacred Scriptures, sothat all should enjoy the same, and not employ his time intranslating from the Hebrew into Latin the sacred writings,unless he follows the same plan he employed when translating Job, which was putting marks and stars in order tomake known where the differences occur between his translation and that of the Septuagint, which is of such authority.Aug. Epist. in Hieron. Epist. 8.6.CONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE575Subsequently he gives the reason for this counsel. “It is amarvel to me,” he says, “that there should have remained anything in the Hebrew copy which had escaped the diligenceof so many interpreters, independently of the Septuagint,Because either whatwhich indisputably exceed all others.was hidden to them is obscure, or it is clear.If obscure,so also in like manner can it be passed over inadvertentlyand even deceive.If it be clear, it is equally superfluousfor you to declare what to them could not be hidden.”In the tenth epistle” (in order to conclude with thisquestion once for all) he discusses this point in a moredetailed manner. He asks for information why he did notact in the same way in regard to all he translated from theHebrew into Latin, as he had done when engaged on Job,where he marked with a star what was in the Hebrew andnot in the Greek; and with an O what was in the Greekand not in the Hebrew, because this occasions a doubt inmany minds. And like to one who deems this labour anidle one, or of small profit, he again beseeches him tooccupy himself in declaring the sacred writings accordingto the translation of the Septuagint, because it would be aserious matter that his translation should frequently be readin the Latin churches, and be clearly seen that it was notin harmony with that of the Greek. And also that it wouldbe a serious matter for him now to attempt by his newtranslation to derogate from the authority of so manyGreek and Latin translations. He accentuates the difficulty by declaring that few are those who know theHebrew language, and thus there are no means to haverecourse to in order to judge whether the rendering beright or wrong.If the Jews be questioned, they may replyvery much the reverse of the truth, and just what mayplease themselves; hence he says: “You will remain aloneEpist, 1o in Operibus D. August.576THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEto convince them, and there will be wanting a judge to decideand give sentence as to which is right.”Farther on he adds something respecting a report orrumour that had arisen in one of the churches of Africa,because a bishop who took pleasure in the translations ofJerome had read out a part of the prophet Jonah, and itsounded different to what the people had been accustomedto and which was accepted by all; and St. Augustine concludes in this third letter against our saint, that probably hemay be deceived in this translation, and that it would bebetter to put it aside and occupy himself in better work.This was the first encounter, together with what he wrotein the first and third letter, leaving aside other things whichI will later on treat of, in order not to have to repeat thisepisode until we come to the reply.Previous to receiving this firstepistle, St. Jeromewrote to St. Augustine, either through Alypius or someone else, forasmuch as he had a suspicion of what mighthave happened—that, on account of Alypius having beenwith John of Jerusalem, Rufinus, and the rest of that band,he might have imbibed some of the evil doctrine of Origen;and this is evidéntly perceived in the reply of St. Augustineto this letter, which is brief, and runs in this manner at thecommencement: “I thank you very much that, as a shortsalutation, you in truth sent me a veritable epistle, althoughall too short for what I should have wished to receive fromyour hand, because from such an individual no letter islong, despite that time be very much taken up.Yet,despite I should find myself surrounded and engrossed bygreat affairs, the business of others and of seculars, Iwould not condone the brevity of your epistles did I notthink it was an answer to my brief recommendation sent toyou by word of mouth." From this is seen that St. Jerome1 Epist. 9, in Operibus D. August, and in D. Hieron. Epist. 87.CONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE577had not yet received the first epistle of St. Augustine, inwhich he, in my opinion, reveals that he had turned somewhat against our saint by reason of the reports affordedhim by Alypius, since he, without any reason, remarks onhis studies of the Hebrew language, considering them asidle and unsafe, and desires him to employ his time in theFor this does he give him to undertranslation of Origen.stand by classing him among the Greek authors when hesays, “He whom you greatly praise in your writings.”From which is perceived with singular light the maliceof Rufinus, John, and the others, because among otherthings they told Alypius that he was very fond of thedoctrine of Origen, in order to make him out to St.Augustine to be a changeable, inconstant man, becausewhat he one day had praised, the next he would condemnand abuse.In this second epistle written by St. Augustine thechief point is the one in the first letter—the interpretationof St. Paul in his Epistle to the Galatians of the point as towhether he reprehends St. Peter disguisedly and by agreement between the two, as St. Jerome expounds; and thissame point is repeated in the second letter.As thesethings must be discussed leisurely, I do no more than pointout the order of things.Besides this matter, he wrote in this second epistle toask him what was the title he gave the book he had writtenon the men who themselves had been writers in the Church,because he had been told (I know not by whom) that hehad entitled it Epitaph, a thing which St. Jerome provedwas only done as it were in scorn, for never had he setsuch a title to his work.There is no doubt that Augustine ratherill-usedJerome in this epistle, as though he had in this commentaryon St. Paul committed some great error, while in a third2 P578THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEletter he repeats the same remarks. None of these letters,however, reached the hands of Jerome until many yearsafter, indeed not for ten years, as can be proved; butthis was not due to any fault of Augustine, but to themalice of his adversaries.These letters were sent aboutItaly, and were read by many for several years, copies andtranscriptions being taken, and could be found in everycity, with notable affront to Jerome; for the wicked maliceof these people strove that none of these letters shouldreach him, in order that, so long as his reply to themshould not appear, they could triumph over him bydeclaring that, through shame and mortification, he darednot send a reply.St. Augustine was not aware of this,or that his letters had never been delivered; rather he washurt that during all this length of time no replies had beenvouchsafed them. And it so happened that after this long.lapse of time and years these letters fell into the hands ofSisimus, a deacon attached to our holy doctor.ThisSisimus came to Jerusalem, and showed the letters toJerome, who, although he well perceived that the style anddiction was Augustine's, yet he did not essay a reply fora very long time after. At length, moved by the affront,he wrote two letters” to Augustine complaining of thegrievance, yet informing him that he would not send areply until he should be certified that those said letterswere his, by receiving one direct from him saying so. Thefirst of these two letters he sent by Austerius, and thesecond by Firmio, and although couched in terms ofinjured feelings, yet protesting nevertheless that he didnot wish to sever the bonds of love and charity; thus atthe end of the first epistle he writes:” “Behold the depthsof love that I bear you, for even though I am provoked,I would not reply, because I do not believe that to beEpist. Hieron. 91.1 Epist. D. Hieron. 92.Epist. Hieron. 91.CONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE579yours what perchance I should reprehend in another." Atthe end of the second one he says: “May God guardyou, beloved friend, in age son, but in dignity father.”(Atthis juncture St. Augustine was already a bishop.) And headds: “I beseech you to be careful that whatever you maywrite may come first to my hands.”St. Augustine rejoined,replying through Cyprian, deacon, and between this replyand the first of the letters he had written there had elapsed,although it appears incredible, twelve years, because thefirst was in the year 393 and these are of the date 406.”And the truth is manifest, because St. Jerome says in oneof the replies that he had not seen a letter of St. Augustineuntil Sisimus came from France to Jerusalem, sent by theholy Bishop Exuperius of Tolouse, which was during thesixth consulate of Arcadius, with his companion Probus,which was in the year 406. And our saint himself, in hisCommentaries upon Amos, says that it was in the time ofthese aforesaid consuls that he made the Commentaries uponZacharias. He says that Sisimus was sent by Exuperius,and that he was the same who received the letters andtranscripts of those of St. Augustine seems true, becausein one of these letters, which St. Jerome forwards to St.Augustine, he mentions St. John Chrysostom, Bishop ofConstantinople, saying that John, formerly Bishop of Constantinople, for he was so no longer, had written a bookupon that epistle and text of St. Paul.St. Chrysostomwas deposed and banished in the year 404, hence it mighthave been the same Sisimus who was sent by Exuperius,and the one from whom he received the letters—I meanthe copies of the letters of St. Augustine—and thereforethere elapsed over twelve years from the first letters untilthose he received by Cyprian, in which was confirmed allthat was contained in the first ones.Epist. Hieron. 94.Epist. Hieron. 92.58oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEAt this juncture Jerome could no longer avoid takingup his pen, and in the open field was started the contentionand the defence on his part.Having regard to the coursewhich followed, it will be well, in order to satisfy allparties, that we should make manifest the chief pointsfor which St. Augustine attacks Jerome, and his reply anddefence.We have already seen the low estimate St. Augustineformed of the study of the Hebrew language, and that hejudged it lost time, and a thing without reason, the translation Jerome was making of the holy books. Let us hear whatJerome replies. “To the first question of the translations,and why I in mine place stars and commas, and in others Ido not, speaking with all the honour and respect I oweyou, it seems to me that you do not understand what youhave asked, because that translation is of the Septuagint;and where commas occur it is to call attention to the fact thatthere the Septuagint said more than was to be found inthe Hebrew text, and where stars occur is to draw attentionthat there occurs something added by Origen from thetranslation of Theodotian, which was translated from theGreek.In these other translations I declared what Iunderstood from the Hebrew, following rather the truthof the sense than the order of the words. And I marvelthat you read the Books of the Septuagint, not in thepurityin which they wrote them, but as they wereemended by Origen, or, better said, corrupted by him,with asterisks and marks.But you do not wish to readthe interpretation of a Christian man, more especiallyas what is added is the translation of a man who, afterthe Passion of Christ, made himself a Jew and became ablasphemer? Do you really wish to follow the Septuagint ?Then do not read with stars or commas, but erase thatout of your books, as a favourer of the old style, and inCONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE581doing this you will condemn as many books as there are inthe library of the Church, for you will scarcely meet withany which will not have them. To the new syllogismwhich you bring against me—if the things be obscure, soalso you may err in them, and if clear, your labour is invain—with the same do I wish to reply to you.All thesaintly learned men who have interpreted the Scripturesprevious to ourselves have interpreted either what wasobscure or what was clear; if what was obscure, how doyou dare after them to interpret what they could not interpret, more especially in the case of the Psalms, which youhave yourself commentated upon after so many graveauthors?And if what was clear, a superfluous labouris yours to commence declaring what to them was nothidden.If your dilemma has any force against me, itmust have in like manner against yourself, and what ismore, with it we should come to the conclusion that it werenot due or allowable to any one to speak after the firstinterpreters, because the first who occupied the place wouldnow refuse the leave or permission for any one else toenter in.As regards what appertains to my translation, I havenot assumed by it to destroy the ancient one, which fromthe Greek I have translated into Latin for my friends,but to show the testimonies which the Jews left behindthem in their translations, in order that to our Latins shouldbe made known what is in the Hebrew text.He whoshould object to read it, let him not do so.I urge no oneto read it. And, if you say you willingly read what I translated from the New Testament, because there are manywho can judge in what therein should be doubtful, and thatthis cannot be done in the Hebrew, so also might you presume of me that I would not in any way forge anything inthe Old Testament, nor would I add anything of mine;582THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEand, if you doubt it, ask the Hebrews, for it would be adifficult thing if they should all have conjured themselveseither against me or in my favour.”Here ends the force of this controversy as regards thepoint in dispute, and from what has been said may bejudged who remained victor.Although the Church doesnot give us leave to judge, since she has approved andembraced the side of St. Jerome—for, as I said above, shehas put aside all other translations for that of this saintyet that St. Augustine should have been discontented withsuch pious and holy labours is not to be marvelled at afterwe have seen the motives which, although in him withoutduplicity, yet in the original persons had been vicious.Hence let it from henceforth never be a source of grief toany one should his labours not satisfy all, since thereactually could have arisen an occasion for those of Jerome'sto dissatisfy Augustine.Let us pass on to the second point, which is theprincipal one.The saintly bishop very carefully readthe works of our saint, and was greatly pleased with hisgenius; the purity of doctrine delighted him, and headmired the variety of the lesson: he was proceedingcarefully, hoping to find something which would afford hima motive for starting some discussion and instituting acorrespondence on the sacred letters. He read the Commentaries on the Epistle to the Galatians. He came to chap.ii., where the apostle St. Paul says he resisted St. Peterbefore all, because he was worthy of reprehension.Beforethe arrival of some of the Jews from where Jacob dwelt,St. Peter sat with the Gentiles and refrained himself fromnothing; after these came he used to withdraw, and didnot eat with them.From this the Gentiles took occasionfor scandal, believing that thereby St. Peter gave themto understand that it was necessary to keep the law, etc.CONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE583From this text of St. Paul Porphyrius took occasion toaccuse the apostle of daring to reprehend St. Peter inpublic. Julian the Apostate, Marcion the heretic, and subsequently others of our own times have taken also occasionfrom this same text to reprehend St. Peter of grave sin inthe preaching of the Gospel.Thus it occurs that somereprehend the one apostle, others the other, and accordingto this both the one and the other err, or both, or all,which is the most certain.In order to reply to Porphyriusand vindicate St. Paul of being daring and St. Peter of sin,our doctor says in the Commentaries that some affirmedthat this Cephas was not St. Peter, but another of theseventy disciples.(This was the opinion of Clement ofAlexandria and of CEcumenius in the extracts which heSt. Jerome reprobates this opinionmade of Eusebius.)at the end of the Commentary with evident reason.In thefirst place, because neither in the Gospel nor in the wholeof the sacred Scripture is there another Cephas but St.Peter, who is so called in the Gospel and in this Epistle;because in the Hebrew and the Syrian languages Cephasis the same as Petra in the Latin and in the Greek tongues.It is seen, moreover, that in all the argument of this Epistlehe is speaking of the three principal apostles, St. Peter, St.James, and St. John, called columns of the Church, andequals with them him who is called Cephas; and althoughSt. Luke did not record this event in the Acts of theApostles (which is the argument of the others), it has noeffect, because he kept silence on a number of other things,which were noteworthy.But, putting aside this opinion,St. Jerome expounds this text according to Origen, Didymus, Eusebius, Theodosius, and other Greeks; and, forasmuch as the commentary is long, I will condense it briefly,so that it be seen with all clearness, the opinion and its1 Magdebur. centur. 1, lib. ii.584THE LIFE OF ST. JEROME“That which St. Paul did,” he says, “was tofoundations.dissimulate and reprehend according to the outward appearance, and thus do those two words sound—In faciem eirestiti. And in the same way as St. Peter did adhere tothe ceremonies of the law as being in truth a strictlynecessary thing, but as dissimulating and dispensed of forthe time being as to the rigour of the Gospel, in order thatthe Jews, who had come from Jerusalem, be not scandalised,so in like manner did St. Paul reprehend, not really, but inappearance, in order to remove scandal from the Gentiles,who were scandalised to see St. Peter observing the law;and in the eyes of these it must be understood he wasreprehensible.This, he says, was concerted between St.Peter and St. Paul, that by thus dissembling to win overthe Gentiles; for otherwise St. Paul would do wrong, andagainst the precept of the Saviour, in not first correctingFurthermore, St. Paul himself hadSt. Peter privately.fallen into this fault, if it was a fault, for he had circumcisedTimothy and observed many other things of the law, andit would ill become him to reprehend in truth another forwhat he himself had been guilty of.”This is the summary of the commentary.St. Augustineread it through; he was not pleased, and he very stronglyreprehended, and very much in detail, St. Jerome in twoepistles, affirming, firstly, that the reprehension was not doneunder any concert nor dissimulation, but in all earnest truth;secondly, that St. Peter was guilty of sin. The whole forceof St. Augustine's argument rests in that, if it is not takenthus, there is falsehood in the Scriptures, a thing which is asimple impossibility.Because if St. Peter did not sin, andin the sacred pages it be said he was reprehensible, thefalsehood is clearly proved, and the great dilemma it involves for St. Paul to say that he did not walk straightEpist. 86 and 87.CONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE585the truth of the Gospel.in accordance withIf hehad come in and walked straight, the falsehood is clear;and once it be admitted that there is falsehood in the holyScriptures, no one thing in it remains firm. Many timesdoes the saint repeat this reasoning, for undoubtedly it isvery grave; and, as he very properly says, if once it beadmitted that under some good reason or holy occasionthere can be found falseness in the sacred writings, anyone will simulate good reasons where it may please him todeclare that here or there the text speaks with dissimulation or simulation.Augustine, fully convinced in hisreasoning, and deeming that he convinces Jerome likewiseby the same, tells him not to make himself a patron offalsehoods, nor favour them, and not to hesitate to correcthis sentence, and, as the Latin expresses it, make recantation.“Forasmuch,” he says, “as the poet Estesicorus losthis sight through having spoken ill of Helen in his verses,and, on returning to praise her, he regained it, so also is heto do; because Christian truth is more beautiful than Helenamong the Greeks, for which more bravely have the martyrsfought against Sodom than the Greeks against Troy.Ido not say this,” adds Augustine, “in order to open the eyesof your heart, for, please God, you have not lost them, but inorder that you may advert, that having them so healthfullyand so wide open, I know not for what dissimulation youwithdrew them so as not to see the many evils which wouldfollow, if once it be admitted that the saintly writer, for somepious cause, is guilty of falsehood.”From all these words is proved that St. Augustinewas ill-informed in respect to our saint, for the reason wehave manifested, and that he was minded to give him tounderstand that there was some one who could open hiseyes so that he should not consider himself the only doctorin the world. Too long indeed did our aged saint delay586THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEto reply to these letters, as we have seen; but the continuedimportunity of his friends, and finding himself with moretime and leisure, now that the long assistance entailed byPaula's illness had ceased, gave him the opportunity ofreplying; and in the first two letters he proceeds with greatgentleness, and among other things he says these words:“I have already run my course, and have gone as far as Icould; now that you yourself are commencing, and you aresoaring with so lofty a flight and wide space, to me belongsthe repose; and so that it be made patent that it is notalone yourself who can quote from the poets that whichcomes to the purpose, bidding me sing the palinode andimitate Estesicorus, who lost his sight by abusing Helen,and regained it by praising her, I bid you also to remember Dares and Entellus, and the proverb which says,The tired ox treads more heavily (El Buey cansado asientaIn truth I pen these words in sadness.mas fuerte el pie).Oh! that I might be worthy to find myself with you andclasp you to my heart, and with sweet colloquies teachAt the end of theyou something, or learn of you!”letter he concludes in this manner: “O Augustine,behold how great my affection for you must be, that, evenprovoked as I have been by you so often, would I wish toreply to you, not believing to be yours that which perchance you reprehended in another." To the third letterhe wrote through Cyprian, deacon, St. Jerome answers tothe purpose, and with some degree of anger.In regard to what touches this question, his reply, if IIn thecomprehend it properly, consists of three points.In thefirst he manifests that he is no patron of lies.second, that the explanation of the text of the apostle,although it is not his, but of the authors quoted, is verygood. And in the third, that Augustine speaks dangerously.Epist. 91 and 92.CONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE587By the first he proves, because he seems to think Augustinedid not understand the explanation of the Greeks, since,according to those authors, St. Paul does not say that hereprehended in truth St. Peter, but in faciem, which meansaccording to appearances, openly and outwardly; and thisis a manner of speech used by St. Paul, as when he saysto the Corinthians, Qua secundam faciem sunt videtts,and again,” Qui in faciem gloriantur et non in corde, andIn all these placesonce again, Homo videt in faciem.Moreover, St. Paulfacies means outward appearance.does not say that it was reprehensible intruth andin effect, but in the opinion of the Gentiles, who werescandalised. And as to what he says that he had perceived,that they did not walk straight according to the evangelicaltruth, he does not say of St. Peter, but of the Jewswho were with him; and thus there is no untruths here,since St. Paul does not say further than what passed,and what he did, and all was by the agreement whichboth had made, and thus did St. Paul declare it.Thisexplanation St. Augustine did not understand, and forthis reason did he think there was some harbouring offalsehood.The second proves that this exposition is very good,Because, if St. Peterand that it must necessarily be so.was well aware, and St. Paul knew that the ancientceremonies were no longer of value after the publicationof the Gospel, and both one and the other perform the selfsame things, when they perceive that it is needful for theadvantage of Jews and Gentiles, who had recently come tothe faith, how then can it be understood that St. Paul reprehended in truth publicly and without admonition St. Peterin so grave a matter, when he himself had done the same?Is it not clear that, with reason, heretics would point him1 2 Cor. x.2 Cor. ii.588THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEout as a daring man, and St. Peter as one who erred in sograve a thing?St. Paul himself says, “I make myself aJew with the Jews, in order to win over the Jews.” HeIncircumcised Timothy so as not to scandalise them.Cenchrea he cuts off his hair.In Jerusalem he purifieshimself, in accordance with the Jewish law, to persuade theJews that he is not unmindful of the ancient ceremonial;and yet is he to reprehend veritably in Peter what he hashimself done so often ?St. Jerome concludes this part bysaying, “It does not appear to me, Augustine, that there ismuch difference between your opinion and mine, because Isay that Peter and Paul, through fear of the faithful, whohad come from the Jews, employed Jewish rites and pretended to observe them; and you affirm that they did sothrough mercifulness, making themselves infirm with theinfirm, with a compassionate spirit, not with the aims ofBe it what it may, either one way or the other,falsehood.either through fear or through compassion, they dissembledwhat they were not.”As to the third point, it appears to our saint that St.Augustine speaks dangerously in saying that the ancientceremonies were to be kept after the publication of theGospel, and that not for that did St. Paul reprehendSt. Peter (these are words of St. Augustine), because, had hewished to do so, he would not have done any unbecoming orfalse thing.St. Augustine added these words, “withoutSt. Jerome says: “I do notbeing necessary to salvation.”understand this; because if they do not bring salvation (salus)or advantage, why should they be keptAnd, if theyare to be kept, without doubt they must bring some profit;moreover, in accordance with what you say, they makethemselves martyrs by observing them, because this cannotbe a matter of indifference, but that their observance isI saynecessarily either good or bad. You say it is good.CONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE589it is bad for the Jews and the Gentiles who already believedin Christ, and thus, if I mistake not, in this part, to avoid adifficulty, you fell into another, and fearing the blasphemyof Porphyrius you dash into the snare of Ebion, judgingthat those who came of the Jews will keep the law; and, asyou see that this is a dangerous thing, you started a glossary,tampering with some words which are not to the purpose,saying, without being necessary to salvation, as the Jewsthought, or under some deceitful dissimulation, the whichHence, Augustine,St. Paul reprehends in St.St. Peter kept the law dissimulating, and this reprehenderof Peter, without dissimulating and in very truth, kept thelaw.Well do you defend St. Paul, saying that he did notdissimulate the error of the Jews, but that in truth he fellinto this error; nor does he wish to imitate St. Peter, whodid dissimulate that in which the Jews erred, and madehimself a Jew in all liberty. New indeed for certain, andnever-before-seen clemency in the apostle, who, desiring tomake Christians of the Jews, of a Christian makes himself a Jew!”Peter.Thus stands the entire sentence of St. Jerome. Assoon as Augustine perceived the goodness and the spirit,so truly catholic, of this holy man, and that he had resentedsomewhat his letters, and was offended at his manner ofspeech, he replied with another full of love and humility,asking a thousand pardons, saying: “That he had wellfelt the force of his arm and the heavy blows of thestaff of the aged Entellus; and he besought him, if hehad offended him (a thing he was far from meaning) withhis letters, like an old ox to set his foot on him as heavilyas he wished, for he was prepared to be stampedon.”And other many saintly endearing expressionsdoes he employ: he appeases him in a hundred ways; hehumbles himself so movingly, endeavouring with profound590THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEhumility (worthy virtue of Augustine!) to make everysatisfaction.”Every time I read this epistle I am moved to tears,Let the readerand love and worship that soul so blessed.peruse it, and with me he will leisurely see the beauty ofit, as with loving expressions he speaks in this strain. “Somany things do I see, and are revealed to me in the lettersthat have been able to reach me written by your hand thatI would wish nothing better in all my desires than to beclose to you; and, forasmuch as I am unable to do so, I amthinking of sending to you some of these my sons for youto teach them, if I should be found worthy of a reply;because without doubt I do not feel myself to possesssuch a wealth of science and knowledge in the sacredScriptures as I perceive and feel there is in you.”Inanother epistle” St. Augustine writes again to him in alengthy manner upon this passage of St. Paul, and defendshis opinion with much skill.In that part where St. Jeromeremarks on the Christians keeping the old law, he furtherdeclares himself, and says he forgot to add a word whichalready he, when writing against Faustus the Manichean,had put, and that was to distinguish the period of time inwhich the Jewish law could be kept by Christians withoutplacing in it confidence of salvation, or giving it any virtuewhatever, and this was in that early time when beganto be divulged and preached the Gospel and law of grace.This distinction of three periods, one before the Gospel, thesecond subsequently, when proclaimed, and the third, whenalready published and established, renders the sentence ofSt. Augustine safe.In the first period the old law was ofprofit, and necessary for salvation, although it was not perIn the second it was neither of necessity nor damaging,fect.Epist. 15, in Operibus D. Aug., t. 11.Epist. 19.CONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE59 Ibecause in it no confidence was placed; solely it was permitted, and without sin some of the things in it werepractised, as in honour of the law recently dead, so as toInbury it with veneration, and thus it was not pernicious.the third period Augustine agrees with Jerome, and says asfollows: “I clearly confess with you that whosoever now,or at any time, both as regards Jews and Gentiles, shallobserve the Mosaic law, will descend condemned to hell,because it is deadly and pernicious; and I even add thatwhoever should keep it, even assumedly, will go to hell.And as you, O Jerome, will not admit that St. Paul now,either assumedly or disguisedly, would keep the law, neitherdo I admit that he would have observed it in truth.And,whereas you admit and concede that in the period near tothe publication of the Gospel, Paul and Peter observed itdissimulatingly,I myself admit that they observed itreligiously and truly, in reverence for its past virtue, andas a holy thing which had been, and did not reject it asa thing of Gentile rites.”This last point of difference between these two brightluminaries appears easy, and consists rather in the namethan in the thing.Their difference is not, as some think,in that St. Augustine sets three epochs and states, andSt. Jerome two, for this is to read without attention; for,in the first instance, St. Jerome reprehends St. Augustinefor not making a difference after the death of Christ andthe coming of the Gospel, and would say that the lawcould be observed; and thus St. Augustine saw thatSt. Jerome was right in pointing out what had been leftunsaid by oversight, and had been said in another part.The difference between the two saints lies in the middlestate between the perfection and full preaching of theGospel and the period previous to the Gospel, whichis the time when the Gospel began to be published, after592THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthe coming of the Holy Ghost, and I say it appearsa question of name.Because, although they may disagreeamong themselves after Christ, it was lawful for some timeto keep the law, with the aim and spirit of observing it,albeit they did not place in it any hope of salvation: andAugustine may say they did, and speak of this middle time,when the Gospel had not been sufficiently promulgated;and St. Jerome may say to the contrary that it was not atthis period lawful to the apostles, nor any one, to observeit in truth.Nevertheless they agree, however, that inthis middle epoch it was lawful to perform something ofthe law, whensoever it might be useful for the faithful.Thisemploying thatword as in our day is done by jurists; and not for thathe thinks that thisis to be called rigorously to observe the law, nor does it seem to him lawful to employthis manner of speech, since they did not do this withSt. Jerome callsdispensation,the object of keeping it, but for the profit of others,pretending to keeppiouscaution, for this is lawful in such like things and in manyothers of the kind found in the sacred Scriptures.it, and dissimulating withTo St. Augustine it appears that it suffices for one tobe said to keep the law, if he does what the law enjoins,be the end what it may, either for advantage or for edification, or for reverence of the law, whence it is seenthat it is little more than a question of name whether itbe called keeping the law or not to do the things ofthe law, dissimulating, or with piety, or some other motive.St. Jerome understood this very well, and he perceivedthe point of discord between himself and Augustine wasHencelittle or nothing, as we have seen from his words.it will be perceived how out of the purpose and far fromthe thought of these two saints were the many questionswhich here some scholastics assume to distinguish betweenCONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE593both saints, since on the principal point the difference isso slight.In my judgment, where these saints are most atvariance is in that St. Jerome will not admit that in St.Peter there was sin, and that, if there was, St. Paul isguilty of the same, and that in neither the one nor theother is there sin, and that there was an agreement between them as regards this reprehension.St. Augustineplainly accuses St. Peter, and says that St. Paul reprehendedSt. Augustine has been followed by nearlyhim truly.all the scholastics, tempering the sentence of the saint,saying that it was a venial sin of St. Peter's.Because,although to constrain or, so to say, to induce towardsJudaism, and not come to the Gospel on a good footing,be a most grave sin in its kind, yet in St. Peter it wasvery slight, because he did not intend this, and he did notdo it knowingly, rather inadvertently, for he did notassume anything but the good of the Jews recently come tothe Gospel, although from this small inadvertence of hisIn my opinion—if this be of any value—followed evil.if the reprehension of St. Paul was done in truth, hiswords would have a deeper meaning than this, because, tosay that they neither entered nor walked in the Gospel doesnot sound inadvertence, nor a thing so venial as it is madeout to be, and therefore St. Augustine, who maintainsthat thedefends hisopinion with all the spirit he can in the last epistle toSt. Jerome, and is very severe against St. Peter, and stillmore so in De Agone Christiano, where he places thisdissimulation and withdrawal among the grave sins of St.Peter, and styles it by the expression depraved and superstitious simulation, and sets it next to the denial, and saysthat he obtained pardon for both the one and the other sin.Epist. 19, D. August. De Agone Christ. c. 30, and in Comment. Epist. ad Galat.reprehension was trulymeant,2 Q594THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthesaintlyto bothHence, I am very dissatisfied with the opinion ofSt. Augustine, because great liberty was thereby takenby the heretics of these times to reckon this among theother fifteen sins which boldly and falsely were laid againstSt. Peter. We might in a contention of such gravitybetween Jerome and Augustine upon the reprehensionby St. Paul of St. Peter divide the victory and assignequal laurelsdisputants, sayingwith Jerome, Chrysostom, Theodore, Eusebius, Origen,Cassian, and others” that St. Peter in no manner sinnedin this part, and with Augustine, Ambrose, and othersthat St. Paul reprehended him without simulation ordissimulation.This appears difficult of agreement, but itis not so if we try to examine the history of the case, andsee how that could truly have occurred; and it appearsthat St. Paul himself opens the door to that consideration.It is evident that this did not occur all at once, nor atone place: the Jews coming from Jerusalem, who hadbecome Christians; the withdrawal of St. Peter from theGentiles; their taking scandal; the reprehension of St.At thePaul—all this had its course, and time passed.commencement, when St. Peter began to withdraw fromthe communion with the Gentiles who from Antioch hadbelieved, one here and there withdrew with him; and atthis the people of Antioch did not take offence, nor couldthey do so, for they knew that St. Peter did not observethe legal things, nor did he comprehend they were ofimportance; thus had he been taught, not only by wordbut in fact, eating and drinking with them what they asGentiles ate before being baptized, without retrenchingTherefore they clearly knew that St. Peter didanything.Magdeburgenses.Chrysost. ad Galat. etlib.collationeAlexand.

AUGUSTINE595not do this excepting as a condescension to ChristianisedJews, and so as not to scandalise them, which is theself-same doctrine taught by St. Paul in the First Epistleto the Corinthians in a very full manner. And if they didnot perceive this it was no fault of St. Peter but theirown that they did not advert to a thing so clear; and withoutdoubt at first this could not have been a grief to them,but, as subsequently this dissimulation of St. Peter's wasimitated by many others and even St. Barnabas, and theywithdrew with him, the people of Antioch felt this verydeeply, seeing themselves forsaken and contemned, and evenheld as unclean by those very Christians from Judaism.For which cause some of them, not wishing to seethemselves cast out of such company, determined to followwhat the Hebrews did, and keep the Jewish rites. WhenSt. Paul saw this, and that what St. Peter had commencedwith prudence and good counsel degenerated, and carriedwith it such disadvantage that the Christian converts fromthe Gentiles were turning to the Jewish law, he judgedright no longer to dissimulate the affair, but reprehendand resist St. Peter before them all (because he was wellaware what his spirit and intention had been), bothbecause the Jews, who had withdrawn with him, ought notto fall into error, thinking that the law was necessary inthe Gospel, and because, should some of the Gentiles haveconceived a false opinion of St. Peter in this affair, theywould put it aside on seeing that St. Peter did notcontradict that which St. Paul did, and from this resistanceshould result, not that St. Peter was reprehended, butboth the one and the other should be cured and the scandalremoved (on the part of St. Peter purely passive), forasmuch as he had done nothing that was unlawful, nor ina bad spirit, rather to the contrary acting with prudence,albeit that without his understanding it the damage had596THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEincreased. And despite that St. Peter had entered intothis justly and saintly, yet owing to the imprudence of thepeople of Antioch, or through many who followed him,the matter had become dangerous, and thus worthy ofSt. Peter being admonished and forewarned, which iswhat St. Paul calls reprehensible, not because he hadsinned, but by reason of the damage which was accruing,and undoubtedly he would sin grievously if, on beingadmonished, he should persevere in it hereafter.Forthen the people of Antioch would at once judge the Gospelweak and of small virtue, since it had need of beingassisted by the Mosaic law. And if St. Peter had perceived this, as appears clearly that St. Augustine admitted,he could not be excused saying it was a venial sin,because it was nothing less than a very grave one, and assuch does St. Paul depict it, a thing which it were morethan temerity to admit in the apostle St. Peter, and a greatfavouring of the heretics.Hence both our saints remainequal in loss and gain, and more than equal in charity.St. Jerome properly says that St. Peter did not sin, andSt. Augustine says well, in that St. Paul reprehended himin the sense we have declared.These holy contentions ended in much charity and ingreat love, both the one and the other remaining wellsatisfied with one another, and that which the Origenistshad aimed to do, which was to set them at variance,ended quite the reverse, because both desired nothingmore ardently than to enjoy each other's society personally.They greatly deplored the absence and the distance,and, in order that this discourse should be concludedpleasantly, let us listen to Augustine speaking to oursaint, where, among other things, he says:—“I beseech you greatly, by the deep love of God bywhich we were redeemed, not to think that the gifts andCONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE597virtues which by divine mercy are in you enclosed, andwhich I spoke of in my epistles, have been mentionedwith false praise and caution, and that, if in any one thingI have sinned against you, I pray you to pardon me.And that which I said of you, alluding to some deedof a poet rather more impertinently than learnedly, I prayyou not to turn it, nor interpret it against you furtherthan it sounds, because I at once added that I did not saywhat I did about receiving the eyes of the heart (becausewith the favour of God you had not lost them), but that,since your eyes were healthful and well opened, youshould be warned, and imitating and solely makingthe recantation and palinode, if we should have writtensomething which needed correction, and not by reasonof the blindness of Estesicorus, which I did not attributeto you, nor did I ever fearHence once more Isimplicity and freedom youbeseech you that with allcorrect me where you may see I need it.Because,although according to the dignity of the titles which arealready received in the Church, the bishopric may behigher than the priesthood, nevertheless Augustine is lessthan Jerome, although from an inferior correction he shouldnot be despised.”"it.Many other things does the great Father proceed withdeepest humility to say.He desires him to communicate with him about his labours, and in respect to hiswritings, which he feels will be of great profit to him.By the hands of Profuturus he sent to St. Jerome some ofhis works for him to peruse and correct, for thus he speaksin another epistle: “This brother takes some works andwritings of ours, and if you deemed them worthy ofperusal I would beg of you to correct them, because I donot understand them otherwise than as they are written.Epist. 19, August.598THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEThe just man will correct me in mercy and reprehend me,but he will not anoint my head with the oil and adulationof the sinner, for he loves better who comes reprehendingI myself can bethan the flatterer with his adulations.but with great difficulty a good judge of my own works,for I would err either from overmuch love or from fear.At times I see my own defects, but I would prefer tohear of them through my superiors, because, when I withgood reason find fault with myself, I easily turn to flattermyself and think I rather sinned through fear than fromIn these epistles passages such asany reason I had.”these occur with great frequency.St. Jerome, on theother hand, never ceases praising Augustine, and writesto him very often, beseeching him to hasten to destroythe heresy of Pelagius.Thus were the contentionsand questions brought to a conclusion and settled, whichoccupied little less than fourteen years, owing to delays inthe receiving of the letters and in the replies coming tohand, due in a great measure to the action of maliciousinen.When these saints understood one another, nothingoccurred to induce them to sever the bonds of love andcharity which united them.Both sought the same end,which was truth, and to please Christ and serve theChurch.Hence, whensoever one of them thought theother was straying from this aim, they did not excuse oneanother, though they loved each other deeply. The exampleSt. Peter and St. Paul lovedin question confirms it.one another greatly, and in perfect charity.St. Barnabasand St. Paul equally so; each of these judged thathis path was the safer, and, as our doctor expresses it,those whom the Gospel had never parted were dividedThey remained (says St. Chrysostom"),by long seas.Lib. 2, in Rufin.Chrysost. in Acta.CONTROVERSY WITH ST. AUGUSTINE599these saints, with their individual natures and conditions,and with these each one in his manner aimed at servingGod. And thus do we see in the prophets: Elias, severe,full of ardent zeal; and Moses, thea spirit of fire,meekest among all who were born, yet both were presentat the Transfiguration of the Lord.Similarly did St.Paul manifest himself in the reprehension of St. Peter,and in not taking with him Mark, severe and zealous;St. Peter, merciful with the Jews who had newly cometo the faith; Barnabas, tender towards Mark, in orderto take him with him; Augustine with Jerome, deemingthat he admits falsehoods in the sacred letters; Jeromewith Augustine, judging that he does wrong in admittingthe old law after the Gospel, and all this occurs within onegreat heart of love, with charity remaining in its ownplace. These contentions of the saints are not commencedfrom human motives; no one thing of earthly mould isassumed, hence they all end in the things of heaven. Fromthis is seen that wonderful effect of love, which resultsfrom these encounters—the soul is more greatly enkindledin divine things when touched with the flint stone and thesteel of contradiction; she is the tinder prepared to receivethe spark, and at once catches fire and raises a flame,then the smoke of prayer and the perfume of charityascends straight on high. On the contrary does it act inthose who take another road, for, as their eyes are bentdown to the earth, on being touched they smoke full ofthe vapour of their contentions as to whether each is ofgreater value than the other, and appears greater; and notonly do the contentions of these not end in any good, butthey proceed from bad to worse.BOOK T H E SIXTHSEVENTH AGE-ADVANCED OLD AGEPROEMIN a book which St. Augustine wrote against two epistlesof the Pelagians, speaking of St. Jerome, he says: “St.Jerome, a man learned in the Latin, Greek, and Hebrewlanguages, passing from the Western Church to the Eastern,dwelt in the Holy Places and laboured in the sacredScriptures until the age of decrepitude.”St. Augustinestyles the age of decrepitude, if we follow him in his workOn the Eighty-three Questions,” that period of life whichextends beyond sixty years; hence, according to this, it isnot saying much to state that he had arrived at this age ofThis is also the opinion of Philo in his Dedecrepitude.AMundi Opificio.This period is so called, either becauseman has not only ceased to grow or to improve bodily, butrather to the contrary he seems to decrease and bendsdown, becomes weaker, and seems naturally to imply thathe is seeking to return to earth, as was said by the wittyPoet : 3Et jam confectus senio, recurvus,Corpore destituor: vitae quoque cedo, valete ;or, because man is so close upon the limits of his life thatfrom day to day he awaits death, faltering at every step heFrom the word in Latin creper, which signifiestakes.1 August., Contra duas epist. Pelag., t. 7.August., lib. 83, t. 4.3 Cocaius.603604THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEdoubtful, and from which is derived the term crepasculo (inSpanish), twilight, is implied the short period of dim lightwhich intervenes between the full light of day and theapproaching night; because so is the life of such as havearrived at this advanced age, which is, like a twilight, neitherproperly alive nor actually dead. The sun divides its pathduring the course of the year into two parts of the zodiac(that imaginary circle in the heavens along which the suntravels, so called by astronomers).The one is alwaysraised to what our sight attains and ends, which is calledhorizon; the other half is below whilst the sun is risingand is above the signs which terminate our horizon, whichare called septentrionales: then it appears that all things live,they are joyful and fresh. When it turns to the other signswhich are hidden in the austral part, all things wither andremain as though bereft of virtue, and are sad.Such isalso the life of man, which, according to the limits God hasset of 120 years, the one half up to sixty appears to possessverdure, and is refreshed with vital heat and moisture.On attaining to the sixtieth year, from henceforth all iswinter and sadness: there is the deficiency of that heatwhich is the sun, and that virtue becomes reconcentratedand returns to the bowels of the earth. That rapture ofProserpine, assumed by the poets, was nothing else but thevirtue of the earth in order to reproduce the plants andcrops, that had become reconcentrated, and gone after thesun to its depths, where it was said Pluto had his seat andkingdom. And these are the lugubrious feasts of Adonis,which our saintly doctor says were celebrated in July;because then the sun, which is Adonis, quitted Venus andwent with Proserpine. The half portion of the earth weinhabit was called Venus, and the other half Proserpine;and whereas one half of the year the sun is there and theremaining half in the other, they assumed these loves ofPROEM605Adonis. And the same philosophy holds good in the lifeof man.With a far more beautiful manner of philosophy did theHoly Ghost tell us the conditions of this half age which isstill wanting (very few men attain to it) by the mouth ofSolomon in Ecclesiastes. “Remember thy Creator in thedays of thy youth,” he says, “before the time of afflictioncomes and the years draw nigh of which thou shalt say, TheyPlease me not.Before the sun and the light, and the moonand the stars be darkened, and the clouds return after therain.”It is a manner of speaking among the Hebrews tosay, before the time of affliction comes: “times or days ofaffliction,” he calls those of this latter age, because thereare no days without complaint, no days of joy, but years oflittle ambition and desire, because the days are lived in aperpetual infirmity. The paroxysms of a lingering deathconsist of the darkening of the sight, neither seeing byday or by night, continual runnings and catarrh, and thento be involved in the cloud of death, and increaseddejection of all the members, after that of the head, andadds: “In that day when the keepers of the house shalltremble, the hands which keep all things shake, and thestrong man shall stagger, the strong limbs, in whose virtuethe whole edifice depends: and the grinders shall be idlein a small number, by the falling of teeth and gums themill is idle, and they that look through the holes shall bedarkened: and they shall shut the doors in the street uponthe teeth, and gums fall out, when the grinders' voice shallbe low, when the stomach no longer digests, and they shallrise up at the voice of the bird [in the case of an aged manall noise awakens him, the birds and the cocks crowingtake away sleep] and all the daughters of music shall growdeaf, for nothing sounds well to him, nor does music any1 Eccles. xii.606THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMElonger please him, nor sound harmonious to his ears: andthey shall fear high things, they look back on their pastlives and behold the sins of their youth, and they know notwhat God will do with them: and they shall be afraid in theway where they shall go to after death and the judgment ofGod, and also will look on their past acts, what steps theytook, as though, had they walked otherwise, it would havebeen better. The almond tree shall flourish, the locustshall be made fat. Man is like to the almond tree, whichgrows grey quickly, and it belongs properly to him, amongall other animals, to grow grey,”—a speedy punishment ofnature, whereby she teaches us the weakness of strength.For this reason Jeremias’ called a watching rod thepunishment which God willed to mete out, and in theoriginal it says rod of the almond tree, because it signifiedthe near and early chastisement. The locust which ismentioned refers to the bending down of the back, owing tothe similitude of some of these insects, which have a sort ofhump. And after the turning grey of the hair follows thestooping of the back, and crookedness, because the backcannot bear the weight of the body. And man journeyson to the end of his age and its duration, and there toawait another longer age over which he has no power tocontrol, but One other more powerful than himself, andmourners shall go round the market-place.All the sensesand all the parts of man with his powers shall fade away,and become saddened, weeping in old age, and to themall no comfort will be available.Before the silver cord bebroken, and the golden fillet shrinks back, and the pitcher becrushed at the fountain, and the wheel be broken upon thecistern. The silver cord, so called here, is that which thephysicians and anatomists style the spinal marrow, fromwhence all movement springs. By the fillet of gold isHierem. i.PROEM607understood the head, and that golden tissue which coversthe scalp. The Hebrew word means head or round vase.The pitcher is the gall, and the fountain the liver. Thegall becomes loaded with the refuse of the liver, which iswrath, and the liver is the fountain of the blood. And bythe wheel is meant the lungs, which are always in perpetualmovement, opening and shutting, and the Hebrew wordmeans heaven or wheel.In cisterns no water wells up,but water is poured into it, and the lungs are above theheart, moving as a wheel, and as though over a cistern, whichdoes not generate the blood it has but receives it fromanother source. And the dust returns into its earth, fromwhence it came, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.The ending of this tragedy is that the earth and dust shallreturn to earth and dust, as had formerly been, and howevermuch man may strive to pander and entertain the flesh,the sentence will be carried out, despite he may rebel, forwhich reason it is said they please me not, as being againsthis desire and appetite.The spirit, which is the otherpart of man, as a thing eternal and without corruption,will return to the fountain whence it came forth, whichWhensoever God isis the Governor of the universe.mentioned in the holy Scriptures under the appellation ofElohim, it signifies the lordship and government of all thatis created, and is always found in the plural number, notonly because He communicates His virtue and power tothe angels for this governance, but to give to understandthe plurality of the Divine Persons, for in these externalworks they have no division, and are in common to allthese; and here also in passing is seen the immortalityof the soul when stating that the spirit returns to itsCreator.It must needs be a thing substantial and subsistent which returns, for accidents in good philosophy donot return, but end with the individual.608THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEThis is the Divine picture of advanced old age.Some wish it to be what Cicero, Marcus Varro, and otherscalled senium, which is not an age of itself, but the latterend of this age, and commonly we call it so, because decrepitude does not apply to a man who is no more thansixty years of age (though the canons and laws of theChurch appear not to counsel things of penance orroughness towards them, considering them privileged), butto such as have passed the age of seventy, or such as throughTo the saints,some infirmity have lost power earlier.although this fits in as regards the body, yet the soultravels by another path, becoming more robust andstronger.The holy doctor shows this in an admirablemanner in the Epistle to Nepotian, and says that all thevigour and stress of penance, and other brave things doneby saints when they are in their manhood, are put downand cast aside in old age: fastings, vigils, hair shirts,sleeping on the floor, and long prayers. One thing aloneremains to them, which is wisdom, the enlightenment of theunderstanding, and great knowledge of divine things: andthis is the Sunamitess by whom in his old age David waswarmed. And this knowledge of divine things does oursaintly old man hold firmly inhis arms, from it hederives heat, and in such sort that we shall yet see him inthis last period of life perform feats of a strong man, anathlete, singing with David: “Lord, Thou has taught mefrom my youth until now, I will sing of Thy marvels, andeven unto old age and white hair do not Thou forsake me.”Let us see him in what he so well understands, full ofdeepest wisdom, yet with his body weary, faded, and undone.DISCOURSE THE FIRSTSt. Jerome writes Commentaries on the Prophets Daniel andIsaiah.He is stricken by a severe Illness.WHEN the saintly doctor had concluded writing hisCommentaries on the minor prophets, his friends and otherswho took pleasure in the study and perusal of grave works,would allow him no rest with their importunate pleadingsthat he should afford them further labours and Commentarieson the sacred books.This was done personally by such aswere close at hand, and by urgent letters and messagesfrom the absent ones. Among others, his best belovedones, Pammachius and Marcella, urged upon him to explainto them Daniel, as appears by the preface to these Commentaries, where he beseeches them to help him by theirprayers, so that by their intercession the Lord might bepleased to reply for His servant against the calumnies ofthe heretics, and more especially those of Porphyrius,who maliciously said that this Book of Daniel had notbeen written by the prophet, but by some other writerof Antioch of thatBoth Eusebius of Caesareaand Apollinaris answered him, manifesting this statementto be false, and likewise is it proved by the holy doctor inthe Commentaries on Daniel, which, despite being brief,nevertheless expressed much in a few words; and, as hesays, he only essayed to touch upon some of the more609time.2 R61oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEdifficult passages. He might justly call them ElucidationsBy these he certifies to usrather than Commentaries.that it was necessary for him to have read many ancienthistorians, Greek, Latin, Gentile, and Christian, since allthese he draws out from the archives of his memory; and thishe has done, compelled to it by the occasion, not willingly,but that it may be seen clearly that what was written by thehistorians of the Gentile people had been long previouslyThese Commentariesseen and declared by the Prophets.greatly pleased St. Augustine, and he makes mention ofthem in the 20th Book of his City of God, where hedeclares them “diligent and of great erudition.”Later on he undertook the Commentaries on Isaiah, alarge work and of great profit, full of the Divine Spirit.These last were due to the continued pleadings and prayersFor so does he express itof the holy virgin Eustochium.in the Preface of the First Book when addressing her. Letus hear him: “When I had barely finished, after a long timeand much labour, the Commentaries on the Twelve Prophetsin twenty books, and also the Commentaries on Daniel,you force me, O Eustochium, virgin of Christ, to pass onto Isaiah; thus what I had promised your saintly motherPaula when she lived you come on me to fulfil to you.This same I remember also to have promised the holyman Pammachius, your brother, and although in love youare both equal to one another, yet you win by your actualTherefore to you and to them I pay what Ipresence.owe, obeying Christ, Who says, Examine the Scriptures, andSeek and you shall find." And a little farther on, whendeclaring the order he proposes to follow in these Commentaries, he says a thing which is well worthy of beingborne in mind by those who treat on the sacred writings:“After the truth of history [St. Jerome calls history whatAugust. De Civitate Dei, lib. 20. c. 23.COMMENTARIES ON DANIEL AND ISAIAH611we call literal sense] we have to view and contemplate allthings in the spirit; and thus have we to investigate Judea,Jerusalem, Babylon, Philistia, Moab, Damascus, Egypt,and all the rest, in order to search in these the perfectmeaning; and in all these things St. Paul (as a prudentarchitect) places the foundation which is no other thanJesus Christ.” A Divine counsel from the head ofJerome, I mean declared by it;for in my opinion thegreat doctor found the foundation in the word of theprophecy of Isaiah, which commences: Visio Isaia filiiAmos, quam vidit supra Judam et Hierusalem.St. Jeromevery well understood that the Hebrew word hkazon doesnot only mean vision, or to see as you will, or with theeyes of the body, but with the sight of the soul mostpenetrating and in high contemplation; from whence thename was taken of the Prophets, who called themselvesIt also means revelation, because Godthose who see.manifested to them, and revealed clearly and distinctly,what things they should have to go through, not only externally and in the course of their history, but in the spiritualstate of the Church, in the secret of the souls of whom isChrist (as our saint says), the foundation and the head.He who with this mind should proceed penetrating andsearching the holy Scriptures, will see many things revealed in the Divine secrets.Butlet no one enter in trustingto his head or genius, but as Jerome entered, after a verypenitential life, always making war on the inferior part, onthis old Adam, by fastings and frequent prayer, and aboveall, with a heart very much detached from wordly interests,from all the pretensions of the vanity of the world; andfurthermore, very humble in seeking masters to set him onthe right road, and not make himself his own teacher: athing greatly abhorred always by St. Jerome.Isaiah i. 1.612THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEIt is a thing worthy of derision and even of tears, towitness the daring with which many of those of our timeswho are deficient of any of these preparations, yet at onceattempt to treat upon the sacred Scriptures, and even, if youplease, to comment upon them, and make books to sell, asthough it were only a thing of commerce.But no more ofthis, since it becomes offensive, and I only beseech them tolearn for their disillusionment, such as attempt this class ofmerchandise, the words of the Prefaces of St. Jerome, as tohow they are to enter upon the study of the holy Scriptures;and they will perceive, if they read attentively, that, as Ihave already often remarked, all his works are offspringsconceived in prayer—not alone his prayer, but also those of asmany as had besought him to engage in these explanations.The saint trusted much to prayer, and to the prayers ofthese his trusted friends, for they were all saintly persons,well knowing that the value is great of the prayer of thejust man.He divided the whole scheme of the Commentaries upon Isaiah into eighteen books. From what hestates in the Proems to these said books will be gatheredAt times he hadthat the work occupied him some years.the thread of his work severed by the ordinary occupationsof the government of his monasteries; the number offoreigners and guests who resorted to him was numerous,and a continual stream, quite sufficient to take up the greaterportion of the day.Moreover, the frequent illnesses whichattacked him were great drawbacks, and during the periodof penning these Commentaries he had two severe attacks,long and dangerous.In the Preface to Book XIII. hegives us to understand that he had been at the point ofdeath, and all his friends feared for him that ere he shouldreach port the little bark would perish in the wreck; and hebeseeches the Most Blessed Virgin to plead with our Lordwith continual prayers to restore him to his former state ofCOMMENTARIES ON DANIEL AND ISAIAH613health, in order he should finish the work he had commenced.In the Preface of Book XIV. he says as follows:—“The Lord, Who looks on the earth and makes ittremble, Who touches the hills and they smoke, Who,speaking in Deuteronomy says, I will kill, and I willgive life; I will wound, and I will heal, also makes myearthly body to tremble and to shudder with frequentsickness, to which it has been said, Thou art dust, andinto dust thou shalt return, and therefore, as though forgetful of my condition and human destiny, He admonishesme oftentimes, that as man and already advanced in age Imay be made cognisant that I am very close upon death,of which is written, Why do you glory, earth and ashes 2Thus He Himself, Who wounded me with so sudden anillness,also healed me with incredible speed, ratherwishing to terrify me than to afflict me, rather to moveHence, knowingme to amendment than to scourge me.Whose is all that I live for, and perchance that the causeof deferring my death is in order that I should bring toa conclusion the work, which I had commenced on theProphets, it is my desire to give up myself altogether tothis occupation, and, as though placed on a high watchtower, to contemplate from thence—not without pain andwailing—the tempests and the wrecks on the sea of thisworld without any present thing giving me any trouble, butsimply looking into the future, esteeming naught the opinionand the gossip of men, but fearing only the judgments ofGod. And you, Eustochium, virgin of Christ, who withyour prayers assisted the sick man, pray now for the healedman for the grace of Christ, in order that with the samespirit as the Prophets spoke future things I may myselfenter into that cloud and abyss, and comprehend the Wordof God, which is not heard with the ears of the flesh, butof the heart, and say with the Prophet: The Lord gives614THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEme a docile tongue, in order that I should know when itis expedient for me to speak,-these being the first words,which head Book XIV. of Isaiah.”In the Preface of Book X., excusing himself for thehaste with which Pammachius urges him to finish Isaiah, inorder to commence Ezechiel, he says he has already arrivedat a great age, and his body is very weak, and unfit forI do notmuch work, fatigued as he is by long illness.know what more a man of iron frame could do than whatour saint does.But to saints all things appear little; andas the desires of the soul in them are so much alive, theyare so exalted, generous, and inclined towards great things,that they cannot suffer with patience the limited powers ofthe body, and are taken out of themselves, urged on bythe spur of the spirit to over-exertion.From all thisproceeds that few are the saints who have enjoyed robusthealth; these are the causes for their usual ill-health andsickness: they wish to run after the Spouse, Who is speeding swiftly before them, if no more than to keep Him inview; they suffer an agony out of all measure, and whenthey can do no more, they wake up the city with the Spouse,and cry, “ADraw me, we will run after Thee.”* And contemplative men lovingly complain to God, such as havepractised some exercises, and have looked attentively intothings divine, because He did not give them other bodies,either more delicate, I mean more pure, more divested ofthe grossness of earth, to be as though aerial or on fire,like some depict the angels to be, in order to rise withgreater lightness to where the desires of the soul impelthem; or, if not so light as that, at least not so fragileand breakable, but as robust as those of other livingthings, who are not overcome by unmeasured labours, orbecome sick, as our bodies do, which by a mere slightCanticles i.COMMENTARIES ON DANIEL AND ISAIAH615draught of air are put out of harmony, and any childishness upsets them. Some reply (who have also wished tophilosophise on this question) that in all the spheres andheavens God has set those who sing His praises, and in allof them there are creatures who have a part in the discourseand arrangement which adorn that choir.In the air thereare His spirits to praise Him; in regions higher still Hehas His own, and each one has his proportion assignedaccording to the place he inhabits, and he is circumscribed(so to say, to use a scholastic term).From this followsif men were formed of bodies more subtile andthat,spiritualised, the theatre of the world would be left withouta proportion of inhabitants, in whose choir would be wantingthe music and choir to echo and resound the Divine praises;where speculation is made contemplating the marvels of God,returning Him thanks, lauding and publishing Him abroad.For this reason it was necessary that their bodies should bemade so, and, although bodies, yet of so high a mould thatit is in truth one of the most noble forms that exist for theDivine praises of all that is below the heavens; and, moreover, so fragile and of short duration, so that they shouldnot linger long in the labours to which they are subject,according to the proportion they bear to the earth, theelement most worked of all. And their Creator determinedfurthermore to draw them out of this poverty and raisethem up to an eternity without limit as a reward for whatin this choir here below they sang in His praise, strivingagainst the weight of the self-same earth, which theypossessed with them. He did not wish the body to be somassive or hard as that of the beasts as that thereby itshould not perform well the offices of the most noble part;and not because they are more fragile than those of thebeasts are they of lesser dignity, but rather as man is ofa more divine nature, so also is he of a more fragile body.616THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEFrom which it springs that man is the best tempered andorganised being of all earthly bodies, since it is evidentthat, where a greater excess of heat exists, less damage isdone by the cold, and all the lesser heats are easily overcome by the greater. And, on the contrary, when the coldis more vehement and the composition does not excel inthis extreme, less is felt of the external changes of heatsor lesser cold, as it easily overcomes and conquers thatwhich is not so intense.Similarly might we philosophise inrespect to other qualities which are not so active, where allthings are more tempered and reduced to a greater equableness, and these have their grades more equalised: anyother which newly comes, counterpoises, conquers, exceeds,and pushes out, joining itself to what it finds here. Andfrom this proceeds the disagreement and the loss of thatharmony and balance in which health consists; and forasmuch as in proportion the body of man is better tempered,so also is it more liable to illness and to fail.From this results that in the finest genius and mostapt for divine things (as ordinarily is that of the saints)we generally find more ill-health, forasmuch as theirtemperament is better balanced, while they themselvesemploy small care in remedying with art what so manycontrary forces are destroying; rather they assist withtheir own careless treatment of themselves in the neglectof their bodies, so that on a hundred sides they areGod arranges andattacked, and thus become infirm.counterpoises to the small powers of the spirit of beaststhe great strength of their bodies, and to the smallcomparative strength of our human bodies the greaterexcellence of the work. The saints neglect or pay noheed to the one, and the machine easily fails.If saintspropose (and foremost among them was Jerome), byfasting continually, by unheard of vigils, by wounding theCOMMENTARIES ON DANIEL AND ISAIAH617body and flinging it on the cold ground during the hoursset apart for rest, by the friction of hair shirts and chainsand a hundred other schemes of this sort, to keep the bodysound and in good health, and have nothing to complainagainst it, they live very much deceived.Oh, happydeceit !Alas, for those who live in a worse mistakebecause,knowing that these are the means to be employed forattaining so lofty an end, and presuming as Christians thatGod must needs give them His glory, they yet pamper andtreat their bodies, not as temples wherein their souls areto sing the Divine praises, but, as St. Bernard says, asthough they were of the School of Epicurus and broughtup with Hippocrates!Consider here a thing very far fromall philosophy, that generally these pampered Christiansattain short life, and all their cares of the body are of smallprofit, full of a hundred ailments with as many differentplasters and remedies, not because they neglected whatappertained to the body, but by reason of their neglect inapproaching to eat the Body of Christ, and thus springs, asSt. Paul says, that there are among us so many infirm,and so many who sleep. On the contrary, the former, whowere so neglectful, or rather careful, to maltreat theirbodies, live, as it is said, long lives, and by their well-nighmiraculous existence teach that length of years depends onanother cause.Let St. Jerome speak, for at the age he had nowattained, for he was very old, as he himself declares to St.Augustine, and confirms it, nearly decrepit, ever watchingand writing, praying, fasting, and working, yet he exceeds inlength of life the great crowd of Sardanapalus, who arereared up under the shadow only of the name of Christians,They deem that theand barely see half their days.Gospel, which they scarcely believe in, was made to618.THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEresuscitate and glorify first the body, and afterwards thesoul; they live under a great-delusion or deceit, and, whatis worse, they will die in it, and will find themselves deadin body and in soul; death will be the first porch leadingto the second death, wherein they will remain for ever.To the opposite side, or to the right, do the saints proceed;they want to resuscitate first their souls, since they hadalready died to their bodies, in order that the body shouldcome to enjoy bliss equally with the soul.Then, indeed,will cease altogether pain and wailing, for they shall haveI havepassed through all this here below never to return.in passing touched on the reason why it occurs to theservants of God to have so many infirmities, and also why,notwithstanding these, they live such long lives, againstnatural reason,—for the good of this Christian Church.An event of great joy, had it but lasted, occurred aboutthis time to St. Jerome, namely the arrival from Romeof the saintly matron Fabiola in the Holy Land and atBethlehem, an event as greatly desired by the saint as itwas unexpected.

On the onehand, the noble matron desired to lead a life of solitude, likeso many brave women of that time, yet on the other shedid not wish to withdraw herself from the holy Cave ofBethlehem, and the Hostel of Mary. At this juncturethere came also the sad news of a great disturbancethroughout the East, thrilling the strongest hearts withfear and sadness.This was that from the extremes of theLake Moeotis, which is now called the Sea of Tanais, or theWhite Sea, and from between the Rivers Tanais and theMassagetae, towns of inhospitable peoples dwelling therein,and from the inaccessible cliffs of Mount Caucasus thereVISIT OF FABIOLA619had sallied forth a great horde of Huns with most lightfooted horse, and were spreading themselves to all parts,causing death, devastation, and torrents of blood to flow,filling every heart with terror and amazement, and castingthe whole world into great confusion. At this time therewere in Palestine and all the region called the Holy LandThese, owing to the present disturbedlegions of Romans.state, had been ordered to Italy, to succour her, and alsoto put down some revolts among the natives.It was acommon report that the ferocious Huns were comingstraight to Jerusalem, impelled by greed of gold, as it wassaid there were quantities in that city. They commencedto strengthen and repair the walls, because, owing to aperiod of peace, they had been somewhat neglected, andforts and bulwarks were erected.In Antioch all thesepreventive measures were followed with greater zest.Tyre was projecting to become (as it had been anciently)an insular state, separated from the land the better todefend itself against the attack of the barbarians.Andeven our beloved Jerome, despite his extreme age, speaksof endeavouring to equip ships and resort to the water'sedge, not so much to place himself in safety as to save theholy virgins from falling into the hands of these barbarians.Among the people there were rife various opinionson this question. As the holy matron Fabiola had notyet unshipped her jewels, and all her goods were stillunpacked, as when she arrived, it occurred to her to freeherself from this stress of circumstances by returning atonce to Rome, since she was not finding here thatquiet and safety which she had come seeking for. Ouraged saint, withall his spiritual sons and daughters,remained in the monastery and cells, because reports hadarrived that the invaders were proceeding to other partswith various designs.62oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMESt. Jerome was very grieved at the return of the holymatron to Rome; he bewails the loss of so good anoccasion of companionship, because she was a woman ofgreat worth, as appears by the funeral oration which heIt appearswrote after her death, addressed to Oceanus.she died but a few days after this journey.Among thesingular things done by this holy woman was a publicpenance she performed in the church of St. John Lateranin Rome, on holy Saturday, in presence of the Pope, all theclergy, and city.Fabiola was among those who on that day made publicpenance during the Divine service.She was vested in acoarse habit, her hair dishevelled and loose, her head andface bent to the ground, and shedding abundant tears.The sin for which she was performing public penancewas this. She had married a vicious, sensual man, whomshe repudiated and left, according as the laws of theEmpire permitted,—this our saint says in her funeral oration;but during the lifetime of this man she wedded another,this being against the laws of the Gospel.This secondhusband died, and God touched the heart of His servant.Fabiola belonged to the principal nobility of the city, ofthe family of Quintus Fabius Maximus, Cunctator, of whomthe poet Ennius spoke that famous sentence referred to byCicero, Unus Homo nobis cunctando restituit rem, and hadassumed the garb of a humble penitent.All the Romans,Christians, and Gentiles were astonished (at the time therewere great numbers of Gentiles in Rome), and those whowitnessed the scene were moved to tears.St. Jerometells us it was a subject of great confusion to the Gentiles.It inspired them to great admiration, and with good reason,because never had their vain gods produced a similar effecton the spirits of their worshippers, as being gods who couldexercise small power on souls. As a sequel to this publicORIGIN OF THE HUNS621penance, she entirely changed her life (for this in truth isthe effect of true penance), and followed this change bydistributing her wealth among the poor, and in foundingOur saint has declared solemnly that shehospitals.attended, cured, and washed all descriptions of peoplewho were lepers and suffering from other loathsomecomplaints, which even persons of pious lives withdrawfrom.This holy matron would seek out in streets andsquares and slums for the sick and the outcast, and in herown arms she would clasp and carry the lepers andcancer patients to the hospitals, where she would tend them,washing and feeding them with her own hands.Manyother things of great virtue and true heroism did sheperform, which St. Jerome proceeds to recount in this letterand funeral oration.Despite all these holy occupations, itis admirable that she never gave up a single point of thestudy of the holy Scriptures, like one who perfectly knewthat this study is the fountain from which all the manyvirtues were to flow, and from whence should be drawnthe water for bedewing and keeping fresh all these flowersof virtue.Oh, what a great confusion is all this to us!For since we do seek lofty aims, enveloped in vaingloryand the desire for public admiration, in order to win goodopinion and praise (let us speak plain), so as to gain money,as with other natural arts and sciences equal fruit is notproduced in us.At this point our doctor touches upon the origin of theHuns according to the opinion of Herodotus.There ismuch to be investigated on this question, both as to thename and classes of Huns, all of which is most obscureand very much involved, and very far from the purpose ofthis work, therefore we shall not discuss this point, butleave it for a better and more appropriate occasion. Oursaint concludes by telling us that after the death of the622THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEsaintly Fabiola there were made in Rome most solemnfuneral rites, such as had never been seen in that city, andwith good reason, for her victories had been greater thanthose of her forefathers, which had merited the acclamationof Maximus, and she triumphed better over the world, theflesh, and the devil than Furius over the Gauls, Papiriusover the Samnites, and Pompey over the men of Pontus.St. Jerome was blessed in this, that all those whofaithfully followed him arrived to great perfection of life,a fact which after the Apostles I do not think had occurredto any other saint.Here also arises the occasion of treating on the publicpenances which were formerly in use in the Church, whatthey were, and what length of time they subsisted, forwhat reason they were put aside, and other things appertaining to an interesting study of ecclesiastical antiquity;but our Lord, if it so pleases Him, will afford us a morelegitimate occasion in which to discuss them.DISCOURSE THE SECONDBy reason of the entry of Alaric into Rome many RomansHe writes theHe alsoholy virginresorted to St. Jerome at Bethlehem.Commentaries on Ezechtel and Jeremias.writes other works.A ustochium.Death of theSt. JEROME was deeply absorbed in the study of thegreater Prophets; he had commented on Daniel; he hadbrought to a glorious conclusion the Commentaries onIsaiah, who are the first and last of the four Prophets.In the hearts of the devoted friends and lovers of thesacred writings their desires were increasing to witness hisexplanation of Ezechiel and Jeremias, the only two of theProphets which he had not as yet commented on. Of allwho more ardently urged him, and to whom we are mostindebted for this work, was the holy virgin Eustochium,and his beloved disciple Eusebius of Cremona.Both these were near the saint, and lost no occasionof importuning him at all times and on all occasionsto undertake the work. He was contemplating beginningEzechiel, as being the more difficult, when the sadnews arrived of the entry of the barbarian Goths intoRome, under the banner of their captains and KingAlaric.Together with this sad disaster came also thenews of the death of his great friend Pammachius, and of623624THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEEach one ofthat of the saintly and beloved Marcella.these events sufficed of itself to place the saint, who waspious and tender in the extreme, in a state of deepdepression.The great doctor for many days remained dazed andstunned, and, as no one can depict his sentiments moregraphically than he who suffered this grief, let us hear hisown words when writing to the holy virgin Eustochium inthe Preface of the First Book of his Commentaries onEzechiel, where he says as follows: “After having concludedthe eighteen books of Commentaries on Isaiah, I wished topass on to the Prophet Ezechiel, a work I had promisedyour saintly mother of happy memory, O virgin of Christ,Eustochium, and thus place, as it is said, the last stone uponthe work of the Prophets, when behold there came to mesuddenly the news of the deaths of Pammachius and Marcella, the siege of Rome, and the sad end of many otherStricken down by sorrow, I rebrothers and sisters.mained stunned; neither by day nor night could I keepmy thoughts away from dwelling on the loss, and in deepconcern as to the safety and liberation of the besieged,and it seemed to me that I was absolutely a fellow-captivein the captivity of the saints.I could not open my mouthor unseal my lips until I received details of these events,yet meanwhile I hovered between despair and hope,and the sorrows and trials of others I bitterly bewailed,as well as the evils that had come upon them, and thusBut now that I know for certain thattormented myself.the bright luminary of the world is extinguished, and, soto say, the head of the Roman Empire cut off, and,speaking in all truth, that the whole world has perishedin our city, I remain dumb.I was humbled, and keptsilence on the losses: my pain was renewed, my heartwas on fire within my breast, and as to my mind myINVASION OF ITALY BY ALARIC625thoughts were increasing the fire.Then did it seemto me to come appropriately the sentence, Music amidtears and mourning is out of season."In order to understand this event, and many otherswhich the saint touches upon, for this purpose I will brieflyexplain the case, following the most approved and bestreceived accounts given by trustworthy authors, moreespecially that of Paul Orosius, a Spaniard, and a writer ofthat very time, and from whom nearly all of those who treatAfter Rhadaon this subject have taken their matter.gasus and Alaric had effected the devastation of Illyriaand Pannonia, as mentioned above, quoting what our holydoctor has declared, they proceeded to journey round Italy.The men composing the two armies were so numerous thatthey exhausted the supplies of the lands along the routethey passed, and could find no food to eat, though thatthey took every eatable thing, because no resistance wasThen the two barbarian captains decided tooffered.divide forces.Rhadagasus took the lead, because thisbarbarian, who was cruel and a pagan, felt a great desireto spill the blood of the Christians.

When the saintly Emperor Theodosius died,he left two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, who were stillHe had assigned to them theirquite young boys.respective tutors.Rufinus was the appointed tutor ofArcadius, to whom fell the Empire of the East, whileHonorius, who came in for the Empire of the West,remained under the tutelage of Stilicho.Both thesewere men of great prudence and governing powers,1 Paul Oros. lib. 7; Blond. lib. 1, dec. 1; Jornandes, Niceph.Oros. lib. 7, c. 37.2 S626THE LIFE OF ST.

He was taken prisoner, his men all putto death or made captive, and in a few days his end came,together with those of his own people.The crowds ofcaptive Goths were so large that they were sold in flocks,like animals, and at a very low price.Alaric now remained alone the scourge of Italy (yet God did notwish her to be visited with so rude a scourging as thatof Rhadagasus); he was a Christian, although I believehe embraced Christianity through the Arians; he was notaltogether bad, nor was he so fierce.He had someencounters with Stilicho, and there were occasions whenPLOT AND COUNTERPLOT627he could have vanquished the Goth completely and destroyed him, so that Italy would have remained safe,but, owing to the design he had formed of making hisson Eucherius Emperor, it did not suit him to bring thewar to a conclusion, because so long as it continued hewas Captain-General, and held the reins in his hands;therefore he put off peace as long as he could, and dissembled the victory against Alaric, and, what was mostabominable, he convoked in secret other barbarians—Vandals, Swedes, and Huns—to come to Italy, and asOrosius very properly says, in order to robe his son inthe purple, he vested the whole world in blood.Alaricwell comprehended the advantage Stilicho had over him,and that he could well effect his ruin; he quite saw throughhis designs, and, in order to free himself of him, he informed the Emperor Honorius of his intentions, pretendingthereby to win his favour and make a friend of him. TheEmperor suspected Stilicho, and began tofear him(seeing that the warnings of Alaric were proving true).So deeply did he suspect him that he essayed to makeuse of Alaric, his very adversary, against his own CaptainGeneral.Such are the chances and inconstancy of humanaffairs: in a moment friends are turned into enemies,because all depends on earthly interests.Some say thatAlaric wished to return to his own land, and that theEmperor secretly desired him not to do so (for he fearedfar more his domestic enemy).Both the one and theother acted in a feigned manner: all things were done bydissimulation, but meanwhile the venom within was doingThe Emperor Arcadius died, and his sonits work.Theodosius succeeded him in the Empire.Honoriuswanted to pass over to Constantinople, in order to secureStilichothe Empire for his nephew, who was still a child.628THE LIFE OF ST.

When he saw that Stilicho was dead,he felt convinced that peace was more certainto beeffected; hence, as Nicephorus says, he again demandeditsilence by Orosius), and,as the reply was not as he desired, he grew wrathful,and determined to proceed to Rome.He carried outhis project: he set siege to the city, and so strictlythat the Romans suffered greatly from want of thenecessaries of life; he placed great numbers of men toSoguard the Tiber and prevent any succour coming in.great was the misery and starvation that a pestilencebroke out among the besieged, and the Romans diedCompelled by so many evils,in countless numbers.they effected the raising of the siege with a large sumHe agreed, because he himof money paid to Alaric.self also desired rest.For this reason, he demandedthat, besides the large sum of money which the Romansis passed over in(thisNEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE629should send, they should despatch ambassadors to Honorius in order to effect peace with him.The embassy, itis believed, was taken by PopeInnocent, who succeeded Anastasius (the Emperor wasat the time in Ravenna, a most strong city, on account ofthe siege); but those who were near Honorius, beingGodagainst Alaric, prevented this good agreement.was making use of them as instruments to punish theungrateful city, which had received so many benefits, fornever had Rome altogether given up and eradicated theidols of the former idolatry, and, what is worse, therehad entered among the faithless Christians other viceslittle worse than idolatry itself; and, as Orosius veryproperly mentions, customs had become so corrupted as inthe times of the pagan Emperors, and along with this andas a consequence all good arts and letters were almostbanished. The holy Pontiffs (according to Nicephorus)obtained that Alaric should approach thedistrict ofRimini, and that the Emperor Honorius should send tohim Jovius, the Captain and Prefect of Italy, in orderto treat as to the agreements. Among other clauses andconditions demanded by Alaric was that Honorius shouldmake him his Captain-General, and that he should be soalso of the Roman and Gothic army, and this be doneauthentically and in writing.Other conditions did hedemand, not very hard ones, and which would all havebeen granted by the Emperor, but not this one, which hejudged was not in any way convenient.Jovius, who inthis part did not manifest much prudence, simply declaredto the barbarian that Honorius did not agree to grantinghim this one, and it is said that he even read to him theorder he carried from the Emperor.At this junctureAlaric altogether broke bounds, and, holding himselfinjured, determined to completely destroy Rome.63oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEHe at once raised the camp and published the resultof the negotiations.Jovius, who saw too late the badresult, and the small skill he had manifested in the affair,wishing now to mend matters (and because it gave occasionto the Emperor to imagine that he was in league with thebarbarian), fell into a greater error, for, in order to purgehimself of this suspicion, he made the army of the Caesarsswear publicly that they would never be at peace withthe Goths, nor with their kings: an oath very indiscreetto make, even if done on a better occasion.All this servedto kindle a greater fire in the hearts of the Goths, and theymarched on their task like desperadoes.Notwithstandingall this, the good sense of Alaric (who although a barbarianwas no enemy to peace) did not allow him to put asideor forget his natural nobility, and on the road he sentambassadors to Honorius desiring, through means ofsome bishops, to come to terms with him.To all thisthe Emperor turned a deaf ear, manifesting himself veryhaughty towards him, and far more towards the city ofRome.Authors never weary of condemning this unconcernof Honorius. Some think that he cared nothing to seeRome destroyed, because he was not on good terms withher.I, for my part, cannot imagine so much evil in aChristian prince, and one endowed with so many virtuesasthose of Honorius; but there are men of suchnatural listlessness, who judge that, as they themselvesare not of a practical disposition, other men will not carrya design to its complete issue.Honorius must have conceived that the anger of Alaric would be a passing one,and that he would come to peace terms with milder conditions; or that, if all things should go wrong, some arrangement would be made with the city by means of a largesum of money, as on the previous occasion. Within the gatesSIEGE OF ROME631of Rome there lived a sister of the Emperor called GallaPlacidia, a lady of great worth, no less in rank than adaughter of Theodosius, who proved herself of muchimportance in the saving of the city, as we shall seefarther on. At length Alaric arrived with his men beforeRome.Those inside the walls attempted to treat on anagreement whereby the wealth of the Romans wouldbe exhausted.Alaric entered her to spite Honorius,who had not wished to make him his Captain-General;and, as lord of the city, he with his own hand nominatedAttalus, who was Prefect for Honorius, Emperor; andthen that Attalus should appoint him Captain-General.This was carried out, and Honorius began to fear AttalusActing under this fear hefar more than he did Alaric.sent a cringing embassy to Attalus, declaring that he wouldtake him as companion in the Empire, and put awayarms, as he had been informed that he was preparing tocome against him—from which is seen the natural apathyof Honorius, who was more addicted to enjoying reposeand peace, despite a shameful one, than to undertake thecares of warfare.But Attalus sent so contemptuous a replyto Honorius that it brings shame to the face to declare it;furthermore, as he was haughty, he quarrelled with Alaricand Athaulphus. It was due to this that Honorius and Alaricbecame reconciled and leagued together against Attalus,who, finding himself forsaken, took the middle path asbeing best in this bad pass which threatened him, to placehimself in the hands of Honorius, whom he knew alreadyas a merciful man. The terms of peace were not agreedupon this time between the Emperor and the Goth, andon Alaric, for the third time, treating upon the subjectwith some warmth, and desirous of establishing peace ona firm basis, it so happened that a captain of the Emperorcalled Saro, who was General and a great enemy of Alaric,632THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEon hearing of it, and in order to hinder these being effectedvery swiftly, selected 300 soldiers of the most valiantin the army, and with some others attacked the camp ofAlaric. They caught the Goths unawares, surprised them,and slew many; whilst others took to flight, fearing thatthe number of the assailants was greater than it reallywas. The wrath of Alaric burst all bounds, and withoutawaiting further developments, putting aside every consideration, he proceeded to miserable Rome and pouredout upon that hapless city the vials of his wrath. Hesurrounded her and took her; some say it was done bythe treachery of those within, as I shall say later on.Yet even here this captain of the Goths did not forgetaltogether his natural clemency or the dictates of religion,albeit badly learned; for, as to the first, he made a prohibition in his camp that none who should take refuge inthe churches and temples, more particularly in those ofSt. Peter and St. Paul, should be ill-treated, or wounded,or taken captive, nor have their property touched whichmight have been collected together, and that these sacredMoreover,dwellings should be held in perpetual security.that they should not kill the Romans, but, after pardoningthem their lives, they should take charge of the landedproperties.There is no author who has recounted in detail, nor,indeed, scarcely said anything in regard to what Romesuffered in this third and last attempt at devastation.Paul Orosius, who was living in those times, could, andknew very well how to do so; but he has buried all insilence.I believe he did this in order not to increase thesorrow of the Christians, and also not to afford an occasionof joy to the Gentiles, so as to pronounce more blasphemiesthan had already been uttered. They jeered at the faithfuland mocked them that, because their gods had left RomeSUFFERINGS OF THE ROMANS633and she had delivered herself to the new faith of JesusChrist, so many evils had come upon her, and she had experienced so great a fall. They were rabid, like dogs, againstthe Christian religion, blasphemed it as well as Christ.This was the argument of the book St. Augustine wrotecalled the City of God—to defend the Church againstthese blasphemies, and to reply for the cause of Christ.Undoubtedly, the hapless Romans suffered great trials andmiseries in these entries and banishments of the barbarians,and in the rigid prolonged sieges much hunger, famine,pestilence, fears,poverty, captivities—athousand varieties of cruelty, which the fierce, offendedGoths vented on them, now that they were victoriousThe greatest indication ofand meeting no resistance.all this that has remained to us are a few brief wordsexiles, deaths,of our glorious doctor, which gave me the occasion forwriting all the above so greatly to the purpose.In the Epistle to the Virgin Principia—which is thefuneral discourse on Marcella—although short, he yet depictsto us the sad course of events and their unhappy results,saying thus: “Sad and fearful accounts have arrived fromthe western parts that Rome has been besieged, and thatat the price of gold the liberty of the Romans has beenpurchased; and after being despoiled, they proceededonce again to torture them, so that after spoliation, lifealso should be forfeited. The voice becomes broken, andsobs deprive me, miserable man, of dictating reasonablythe thread of this discourse: the city which had overcomethe world has been taken, or rather, it should more truthfully be said, it perished by hunger rather than by theknife, and scarcely could a few be found to be taken as miserable captives.Rendered by hunger rabid, the wretchedpeople within the besieged city seek forbidden food, andit has come to this point that they cut off their own634THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEmembers; for the woman does not spare the child at herbreast, and what she gave birth to a short time beforeshe now devours.” These things which our saint bewailshere, demonstrating acute misery, were recounted to himby the miserable fugitives who had come flying from Rometo Bethlehem.They described to him those calamitieswhich have obviously to do with the first siege of Alaric;and subsequently other things of the second; and lastlythe events of the third, when, as an enemy, he tookpossession of the whole. The treachery by which Romewas entered this third time is referred to by BaptistaIgnatius, who says he found it in Procopius, a Greekauthor, and he marvels that it should have escaped thePossibly, he says, the copy from which hetranslator.made the translation was defective.Hence he says thatAlaric had Rome under siege for two years, duringwhich time he was unable to effect an entrance; then heresorted to a subterfuge, and pretended he was going toraise the siege of his own will, for which purpose he senta band of some 3oo young men of the most valiant asThese hadit were a present to the citizens of Rome.received their instructions.They were to serve verydiligently their masters, and with every manifestation ofaffection; and on an appointed day, when the sunwould be at its highest, and the people less suspiciousof treachery, and the Romans napping and resting, theyshould all run together to the door called Asinaria; andattacking the guards unawares, put them to death, andthen open the doors to allow those who would be outsideto enter in.Meanwhile the Goths were delaying their departure,pretending that they awaited something further that wasnecessary to them.

The Goth was astonished tobehold so much wealth, such a collection of exquisitevessels of gold and silver, without comprehending whenceall this could have come and for what purpose.She thensaid to him, “Dost thou behold all this treasure and so manyWell, you must know that these are allprecious vessels?consecrated to the service of the Church of St. Peter.Oros. lib. 7, cap. 4o ; Blond. lib. 1, dec. 1; Kalen.

The houseof this holy virgin was a great distance from the Church ofSt. Peter, so much so that it was necessary to traversenearly the whole city, but along all the distance did they carrythis treasure of great wealth right through the soldiers andbarbarians openly and publicly. Some of the vessels werecarried in their hands, others on their heads, others againclasped in their arms, for by reason of their weight andsize they could not be taken covered or better guarded,yet no one touched them, because this procession of mencarrying these precious things was escorted and guardedby a strong squadron of Goths bearing naked swords. TheRomans who witnessed so strange a spectacle were overcome with joy, and in the midst of their extreme sadnessand calamity joined them in singing hymns and songs ofgladness, Romans and Goths, until they placed the holyvessels in the safe custody of the owners.By thisspectacle the infidels and the pagans who were in the cityremained in great confusion, beholding so strange an effectof Christian faith in the midst of such fury and pillage—a thing altogether miraculous.Here Orosius notices, asbeing a pious man, that this occurrence was as it werea Divine disposition to save in such great straits the638THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEfaithful, while the Gentiles and false Christians were left toperish: because the good and the religious, as soon as theyhad cognisance of this event, came forth from their placesof concealment, moved by faith and devotion, and byaccompanying the sacred chalices and precious vessels weremade free according to the warrants given out by theSupreme Captain, Alaric; while those of small faith andstill more wretched morals remained concealed, where thesword of the enemy found them.And these vessels,Orosius says, were like the sieves and sifters, by whichGod separated the good from the bad.This is in brief taken from Orosius, and he has fullreason for taking note of this and enlarging on it.Because I know not that we, who pride ourselves uponbeing Christians, were we put to the proof, would manifestso much respect for St. Peter and St. Paul, or indeed forIf there be any proof of this, our recent historiesGod.will show it.The Goths continued within the city forthree days: they burnt down some of the buildings—a few,says Orosius, because those who bear in mind the numberburnt down by the Emperor Nero and other similar monsters,who were reared within the Roman walls, simply for theirown pleasure, seven hundred years from its foundation, andthree hundred more or less before this entry in question, willhave reason to see that there is no comparison. And thosewho recall to mind the fire which the French in other timeskindled there, which fire continued to burn and its ashesnever cooled for the best part of a year, will not beastonished at these few sparks; rather he will clearly seethat this event was plainly a Divine chastisement, and tocorrect pride and ambition, the luxury and brutality of thosewho called themselves Christians, yet who were an affrontto that holy name.And what buildings had escapedthe hands of the conquering barbarians within the sameAN EVENTFUL MARRIAGE639year were struck by lightning from heaven, and many seton fire.

Thus does the saint himself tell us in thecourse of his Commentaries upon Ezechtel.I believe thatduring the time when he was writing them, not only hadthese miseries passed over the sad city, but that even thelast entry had taken place and the last destruction had beenwrought there by Athaulphus.I infer this, because the holymatron Marcella died after all these sad events, as the saintAnd, when hehimself writes in her funeral discourse.640THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEcommenced the Commentaries, Marcella was already dead, aswe saw in the Preface of the First Book.Athaulphus waselected Emperor after the death of Alaric, four years afterthe entry into Rome, and according to others in thesame year, and he reigned six years, at least he died in theyear 416 or 417 after our Redeemer, according to Orosius.He himself mentions that being in Bethlehem with ourglorious saint, he told him that he had had with him asoldier of Narbonne, a principal and grave man, who hadtold him that Athaulphus had had a great desire to levelRome altogether to the ground, and build up another city,which in grandeur and majesty should altogether exceed it,and, burying the name of Rome, call it Gotia: and, just asthat one would remain a second Rome in the world, so alsoshould the name of Athaulphus enter in place of that of Caesarand Augustus in the subsequent history of the empire. Thisintention and thought, so rude and barbarian, was removedfrom his mind by the prudence of Galla Placidia, who knewhow to urge such good reasons to dissuade him from hisintention, that she induced him to again lift up the grandeurThis was, as some affirm, after heand dignity of Rome.had once robbed and despoiled her of all that remainedafter the first entries and sackings; and by the persuasion ofTherefore it was afterGalla he did not touch individuals.all these events and terrible occurrences that our doctorwas occupied in writing his Commentaries upon Ezechtel.In the Preface to Book the Third he bewails this fall bysaying: “No one thing is long if it has an end, and thelong past course of events profits but little, had not asufficient provision been made of good works by such aslook into the future, and what is eternal, and under nocircumstances do they withdraw. A true sentence is this: Al/that is born dies; and what is full grown grows old." And1 Blondus says he was of Barcelona.THE “COMMENTARIES UPON EZECHIEL.”641in another place he says: “There is no one thing that ismade by hands or art but which through age crumbles. Whowould have thought that Rome should have had so great afall, which had been built and ennobled with the spoils of thewhole world, and that she herself should be both motherand sepulchre of her citizens, and that all the shores ofAfrica, the East, and Egypt should be peopled with thesubjects and slaves of the city which was the Mistress ofthe World, and that daily in holy Bethlehem there shouldresort as poor mendicants the richest and the noblest ofher citizens—men and women to which we are no longerable to afford the relief desired, yet sympathising withthem, and mingling our tears with theirs? Hence occupiedwith the burthen of so holy a work, since we cannotwitness the numbers who come to us without wailing andweeping, we have put aside the explanation of Ezechiel, andindeed all other studies, exchanging for works the words ofholy writ, and not speaking of holy things, but doing them.But, as you importune us afresh, O holy virgin Eustochium,we recommence to prosecute the work already begun."In this tender way, as we have seen, did our holydoctor feel the fall of Rome, and it was a great hindranceto his labours of commenting thus to have the thread of itinterrupted by the care of so many poor, so many afflicted,seeking for them some solace and comfort, exercising worksof great charity, and perchance, towards some from whomin former times he had received but little enough; for ourLord brings oftentimes such as these into the hands of thevery ones they once formerly persecuted, for the good ofboth parties, so that the ones are exercised, and the othersIt was to do thissee and acknowledge the wrong done.work that the saint laid down his pen.It seemed to himthat the pressing wants of these poor ones were commendedby God to his care at the present time not for future trials.2T642THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEwhich might follow, for He would provide in His time forthe latter.Jerome knew well how to attend to all and togive each his proper meed of time, as the wisdom ofSolomon teaches us in his Wisdom and Ecclesiastes, thepresent was the time for weeping and to show compassion,not for writing or for the enjoyment of calm meditation.In the Preface to Book the Seventh he says as follows:“I confess that very long ago I promised to write theExplanation of Ezechtel, but I have been unable to fulfilthis promise, owing to the duty of attending to those whocome from all parts of the world; because there is no houror moment in which we have not to go forth to receive thecompanies and the squadrons of brothers and sisters; andthe solitude of the monastery is exchanged for a continuous receiving of guests, to such a degree that eitherwe must needs close the doors, or put aside the study ofthe sacred Scriptures: from which we learn how we haveto open them.

JEROMEthem.”'. I hold it as certain that this holy virgin died beforeSt. Jerome commenced the Commentaries on Jeremias,which was the last of the Prophets he commented on; and,if we notice the “Prologues upon Ezechiel” we shall seethat he had promised these to the holy virgin, and, as inthose of Jeremias he makes no mention of her in any ofthe prologues, it is evident that she was dead, and therefore that her death occurred during the period which elapsedbetween the conclusion of the Commentaries on Ezechteland previous to commencing those upon Jeremias—a longlapse of time and silence, owing to his illness and grief atthe death of the saintly woman.This last work he dedicated to his beloved discipleEusebius of Cremona, for no other object remained to himin life but him; and, as he makes no mention of his brotherPaulinian, it makes me think that he also had died.Subsequently he wrote the “Commentaries on the Lamentations of Jeremias” during the last days of his old age, andas the close of his labours.Here he bewails with the holyProphet not indeed the fall of the earthly Jerusalem, northe captivity of Israel and Juda according to the flesh, butthat of souls and the Christian people.In the Preface onthese last Commentaries he again explains the HebrewAlphabet, as we have already said.After this, little can he have written beyond a fewepistles and the funeral discourse on Fabiola and Marcella,and I even think that he wrote this previous to the ComTherefore I will now bring to a conclusion thementary.account of his saintly labours. About this time there aroseagain the reports of the coming of the barbarian Huns intothe Holy Land; the rumour proving a fact, because theytraversed it, and brought companies and squadrons, whichspread devastation and ruin, for in their cruelty they sparedEpist. 179.HUN INVASION OF HOLY LAND645no barbarian act, all being put to death, and burnt whomthey came across; indeed so great was their fury that thesaint very nearly fell a prey into their hands. For thus doesSt. Jerome express it in the Epistle to Marcellinus, wherehe briefly touches upon the fact in these words: “Thisyear there came a sudden inroad of barbarians, and theyscoured with great fury all the limits of Egypt, Palestine,Phoenicia, and Syria, so much so, that like a fearful torrentthey carried all things before them, and it was only by themercy of Christ that we were able to escape their hands;and if, according to the famous orator, laws are silent amidthe clangour of war, how much more so is this the case withthe Studies of the Sacred Writings, a task which demandsthe reading of many books, great silence, and much safetyand repose?” This coming of the barbarians took placeafter the entry of Alaric into Rome, and before the saint concluded the Commentaries on Ezechiel. Many other thingsmust remain untold, as it would be an infinite labour toattempt to write them all.Now there remains still tobe written his glorious departure to a better world, but alldetails respecting his death we shall carefully handle, asthere is not much light thrown upon it by the writers ofthat time.Epist. 82.DISCOURSE THE THIRDThe Passing Away and Death of the glorious Doctor,St. Jerome.It was full time that the great Father and holiest doctorof the Church, Jerome, should end the long day of his holypilgrimage, and finish the course of a life so protractedHis frame, despite the weight of so manyand so divine.years, was not indeed bent, but spent, and no longer ableto contain the soul; worn to a skeleton, thin, wasted, pale—a form of skin and bone—the exterior senses couldscarcely exercise their office, but his interior ones suppliedthe deficiency.The vigour and virility of Jerome hadentirely withdrawn to the heart; there indeed they wereas vivid and whole as in his earlier days, but his physicalstrength no longer corresponded to the desire.It was asingular sight to behold his body, as it were, formed ofknotted roots, held together and supported barely by twoemaciated legs;nevertheless his breast was heavingwith the burning desires and fervent yearnings for undertaking great and lofty things, while his spent powers wereHis soultoo weak to execute the smallest of them.supplied all these defects; and such labours as-beingmore proper to it—he could execute without the body,were his support and his nourishment, and were carriedout all the more perfectly because less hampered by theHis advanced age had removed fromweight of earth.646DEATH OF ST.

He saw himself enjoyingso much good; he saw that the labours done with theassistance of the Divine Grace during the course of hislife were now yielding delicious fruits; and throughhaving placed them in so safe an exchange, were affordinghim high interest.He already comprehended by experience that Psalm which he himself in earlier days hadexpounded, “Unless the Lord build the house, they labourin vain who build it"; that it is impossible to obtain bycraft or force what is only bestowed by grace.All isresolved into falling down and mounting up; to rise early,and to sit up late, eating the bread of sorrow and of648THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMElabour, unless God sends the sweet sleep, that reposewhich He has in reserve for His beloved ones. Thenindeed is the fulness attained.There indeed is abundancefound; then do all riches come together of the inheritance ofthe Lord,—house, children, property, fruits, cattle, and an invincible strength against all the most powerful enemies whocan range themselves to oppose the passage and entrance.And furthermore he was likewise comprehending inthe inner depths of his heart the meaning of the wordsof St. Paul when writing to the Hebrews’ he told themof another seventh day for the people of God; becausehe who enters into the rest of Jesus Christ rests fromhis labours, like God from His works.In this seventhday did Jerome find himself placed; in this respite fromlabour and rest which eye never has seen, nor earheard, nor has it entered the heart of man to conceive,for he must indeed be more than man who could attainto it—no longer the old Adam, nor a form arrayed inapparel and dress, but a being despoiled of all that, a newman vested in Jesus Christ, who has passed through thenarrow door, along the sharp crevice where the ancientserpent despoils itself of its old skin and comes forth withrenewed skin, a child of God, a consort of the DivineNature, a favour never merited.Being inthis most blissful state Jerome, yearningwith his whole strength for these frail bonds to be brokenand the knot cut asunder which bound the body and thesoul together, since no other ties of sin remained, allhaving been consumed by his continual penance, burntup by the fire of charity—there came over his emaciatedlimbs so extraordinary a heat, which seemed to burn to asheshis frame.Sigebert, in his Chronicle, affirms that hewas so consumed by fasts, so weakened by penances, soHebrews iv.DEATH OF ST. JEROME649worn out by instruments of penance, that he was forcedto lie full length on his poor bed, unable to raise himselfup or stir unless by the aid of a rope which had beenConscious thatsuspended from a beam over his bed.this fever would inevitably take him to his desired repose,and that the end of his labours was near, and the Crownof Faith, having been kept and defended, was now closeat hand, a great joy came over our beloved Jerome owingto the great desire of arriving to the desired haven. Hebroke out in loving cries full of devotion and ardentsentiments; at times he would exclaim, “I think I shallsee the riches of the Lord in the land of the living,knowing full well that in the land of those who die theyAt other times he would sing withcannot be seen.”David, “I rejoice at the good news that has come to me;we shall go into the house of the Lord.Blessed arethose who dwell therein, for they will praise Him for allages.”Again, at other times he would cry, speakingwith his sweet Jesus, and say, “My heart is ready, Lord,my heart is ready: I will sing psalms; I will cry, Glorybe to the Lord!”Every moment seemed to him a day,each hour a year; time was slow in passing, and delaywas prolonged.Yearning as he did for the realisation ofhis hopes he would exclaim in loving complaints: “Ah,woe is me! My exile is long; my soul lingers too longin this dwelling.I long to find myself unbound anddelivered from this darksome prison-house, and to fly awayto Jesus Christ.The wounded hart does not desirethe cool waters so greatly as I desire Thee, Lord God,living and strong.”The fever was running its course: his disciple, Eusebiusof Cremona, and his other spiritual sons and daughters fullyrealised that the end was coming.This they perceived notso much on account of the ardour manifested, by Jerome as65oTHE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEin the joy which was reflected in the saint's countenance,like one who already finds himself close to the long-soughtfor haven.Their hearts were struck icy cold, and theycommenced to weep bitterly and to manifest deep signs ofdistress and grief, for it seemed to them almost unbearableto be deprived of so great a father, to be forsaken by sucha captain, and to be left by so learned and dear a master.When they came into his presence they dissembled theirgrief, for they feared to give pain to the great doctor bymanifesting deep feeling.They saw on one hand the goodreason that existed for God to take this saint to his wellwon rewards, to a well-earned rest, and to the award of agreat prize for his well-sustained combats and victories; yet,on the other hand, they felt how great was their loss. TheybesoughtGod in prayer for an unreasonable thing, yet to theiradvantage—that he should be left to them yet a few yearslonger, because though aged and consumed as he was, yetthey loved him, for he was before them a living sermon,and his presence among them truly an open book: thatwhen he should be gone, they would lack all things; theywould become dispersed: that so costly an edifice wouldcome to ruin, and that He should not permit in His mercyso many evils. This was the summary of their prayer; thisthe theme of their petitions.Among the works of St. Jerome' there is found a letterof Eusebius of Cremona, the beloved disciple of St.Jerome, to Damasus, Bishop, and Theodosius, Senator ofRome, in which is narrated in detail the passing away anddeath of our great doctor.It is in my opinion, as well asof many other experts, a letter of no authority for manyreasons. The first reason is, that it is unworthy of so noblean author, for it is written in a poor, low, coarse style,written by a common mind, and full of errors when quoting1 Apud Marian. t. 9; Apud Erasmus. t. 4.DEATH OF ST. JEROME651Scripture and history, aping Eusebius, Cyril, Augustine, andeven Jerome. He feigns to write to Damasus, Bishop ofthe Porto, with whom he pretends the saint is very intimate,If he pretends to becalling him “Lord and Father.”writing, as he evidently does, to St. Damasus, Pope, hecould not betray greater ignorance, for it is a well-knownfact that at the Epoch of St. Jerome's death some fortyyears had elapsed since the death of Pope Damasus, whichoccurred previous to St. Jerome quitting Rome, as can beverified by a hundred other proofs, and, as we have seen,after him was Siricius elected Pope, who governed theChurch for more than fifteen years, after whom cameAthanasius and then Innocent. To Innocent succeededZosimus, and at the time of Jerome's death Boniface I.was in the chair.There does not exist in all the writingsof our holy doctor any mention of any other Damasus,neither letters nor a single word, yet the author assumes agreat familiarity with him: moreover, in all the works ofother writers of the time there are no records left to usof any such Damasus—I do not say Pope, but no Bishopof Porto—nor do we know what port he refers to butthat of his own ignorance, where he resorted to to inditethe said letter.And, furthermore, this feigned Eusebiusdeclares that, when St. Jerome was at the point of death, hebesought him to write to his father, Damasus, Bishop ofPorto, and commend him to his prayer, and beseech him notto allow his works to be corrupted by the heretics, hisenemies, and to guard carefully the Church. Whence itis seen that this good man meant St. Damasus, Pope.Farther on he confirms this, where he calls St. JeromeCounsellor of the said Damasus and his adviser andfamiliar in grave questions, and quotes some well-knownpassages in the letters of Damasus and Jerome.1 Porto, near Rome and Ostia, one of the ancient ports of Rome.652THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEPutting aside all further quotation as being a feignedand false thing, and not in reason to be believed or takenany notice of, yet, nevertheless, I dare to affirm that hehad near him something of Eusebius of Cremona, whichafforded him the occasion of writing this letter, because, ifwe consider the writing and examine some of the statements, there is a great similarity, and reasonably so. Moreover, there are parts which are readable, and are interestingand probable.Among other things he says that thecouch whereon the saint reposed was surrounded by hismonks and his spiritual children, whom he had nurturedwith his doctrine, who were all sorrowing and in tears athis sad state.St. Jerome spoke consoling words to them,grave, holy, affectionate and efficacious, exhorting themto perseverance in virtue, and in the purpose of life theyhad commenced, since they were so sure of the Crown.He set before them the shortness of life, how that neitherlabour nor contentment lasted long, and that even whatdoes seem long has its end: but the reward is endless, themeasure full and running over.He besought themearnestly not to lose heart in the time of persecution, norfaint away in the direst straits and encounters.Herepeated to them the words of the psalm, “Expect theLord, do manfully, comfort and strengthen the heart:wait and endure for the Lord until He comes.”Heraised their fallen spirits to this confidence by words andexamples which, as his last utterances, were inflamed withgreat love, and thus remained more fully impressed on thememory. He bade them not grieve at his absence, thatthey had not come there on his behalf, but at the voice ofDivine trust, which never is absent or dies: for He is thetrue Succour, Father, Helper, and Pastor; and so long asthey possess Him naught is wanting to them.That a manmay disappoint another fellow-man is a small deficiency,.DEATH OF ST. JEROME653for God supplies the want, and even with a most bountifulhand.After the death of Moses, who had brought out ofEgypt the Children of Israel, there succeeded Joshua, wholed them into the promised land. When Elias was ravishedup in the chariot of fire, who was a man of zeal and stern,there remained in his place Eliseus with a doubled spirit:and even should all fail, out of the very stones He knowsLet them on theirhow to draw forth sons of Abraham.part endeavour to preserve union, charity, and peace asthey had done up to then, that it was by these things thatthey should make manifest not indeed that they were hisdisciples, but disciples of Jesus Christ, true imitators of theApostolic School, of which it was said, as the height ofexcellence and perfection, that they had one soul and oneheart in God: a proper mark of the Evangelical law, tois in thiswhich the Mosaic law never reached, and itthat the actual difference exists, that this was the aimwhich God had in view when He came to the world, toestablish this unity among men, thereby making of twopeoples one, and the ox and the ass to worship at thecrib, both to wear the same yoke, reconciled among themselves with the angels and with God.After saying these words, and others of equal and evengreater weight, feeling that his last hour was approaching,he asked that the most Holy Body of Christ should bebrought to him. When the blessed Sacrament was broughtand placed before him he strove to rise up as well as hecould in his great weakness, by the force of his fervour, andattempted to kneel and adore Him, shedding copious tearswhich seemed almost impossible could come forth from soemaciated a frame. He addressed to It loving, tenderwords and such deep soliloquies only comprehended byJerome and his God. He called It his Spouse sweet and654THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEloving, concealed behind that thin veil which was like thetent beneath which the Mystic Union was celebrated in sogrand a Sacrament, and which the vessel of election is inastonishment contemplating what is hidden within—a secretkept from all the angels, the devils, and from men since theforming of the world, yet revealed in the evening of the world,and learned from the Church, and in her made known to allthe highest potentates and princes. The terror of hell, thefall of the Kingdom of Satan, where he lost his right, wherehe found himself cast forth from the world, banished fromhis principality, vanquished by his own wisdom, captive in hisown fetters, an irremediable fall, the great victory of God,key to His monarchy, the royal title of His empire. Attimes, when St. Jerome contemplated the great Love whichhe had before him, his countenance would become lightedup with joy: to be succeeded after a few moments, whenhe considered the great Majesty of God, by a reverentialtremour. Great indeed had been the respect which this saintfelt the whole of his life towards this ineffable mystery,since, as we have seen, he held himself unworthy to exercisethe high office of the priesthood; and in this same fear hadhe indoctrinated his brother Paulinian and as many asresorted to him. Now he holds Him in his hands at thiscrisis of his life, combated by love and fear, not indeedservile, but filial, and by a great reverence, these two strongpassions wrestling within him, each striving to take possessionAt length he parted hisof all that was best of his soul.lips and received that glorious Food, that Bread of eternallife, and then there came over his countenance an admirablelight, full of celestial bliss.Jerome embraced his spiritual sons, and, bestowing uponthem his blessing and peace, he bade them farewell. Fromthis moment he spoke no more, and withdrawing his mindinteriorly like to one who was already in glory, his soul reDEATH OF ST. JEROME655mained absorbed with all its powers to do homage to thegreat Prince, Whom he had received in his house. Heremained in this rapture for a long while without anyoutward movement, and, when the sacramental specieswere being consumed, before the Corporeal Presence ofJesus Christ had disappeared, he made so great and superhuman an effort to join and embrace his Spouse and lastEnd that all action and power were suspended even to thebeating of his heart; his weakness, however, was too greatfor him to be able to withstand the effort he was makingto lift himself up in this rapture and ecstasy, so that the bondsof life were severed and his soul, delivered of its earthly coil,flew like a pure dove to the eternal mansions.At that juncture, or a little before, the cell became filledwith an extraordinary light; and as it were a mist or veilof resplendency suffused the countenance of that gloriousface, dazzling the eyes of those who were around him, somuch so that no human eye beheld when the last breathof life was drawn. Then was heard rising up a murmurof joyous admiration and of weeping from those who werepresent, sprung spontaneously rather from a feeling of consolation at witnessing so saintly a spectacle as that lastscene, while tears and wailing followed in grief and sorrowTestament and inheritance were none.at his departure.Yet in truth it was very great: that holy place acquired forthe possession of his sons, that Crib and that Cave were theNever didinheritance Jerome bequeathed to his monks.earthly prince endowed with the wealth of the world everleave such an estate as an inheritance for his successors.It was there where Jerome had laid out his heritage, andas such it became the Mortuary Chapel for his remains.He had directed that his body be buried in the Cave ofthe Crib, and be laid close to the Manger—a thing noman in the world had merited.656THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEIn this manner did the great Jerome pass from this lifeto the life of heaven: he who was the terror of heretics andof bad Christians, the consoler of the pious and the good,the joy of some and the sorrow of others—some becausethey do not see their own evil, and others because they donot comprehend their own advantage. The saints do not diewhen to our eyes they seem to die: rather to the contrarythey enter into eternal life—a life which has no fear ofdeath; a secure possession, exchanging little for much, forthey enter into the joy of their Lord. They come in tobe lords and princes who up to that moment laboured likegood artisans and faithful servants, putting their talents tointerest. Of the saints holy Scripture oftentimes declaresthat they die full of years in a good old age; wishing tosignify by this that there was in them nothing empty, norin death anything ignominious, nor in their old age anythingthat was frail, but that, when they reached the terminationof their course, all was full and completed. They died in afull integrity, for so does the word full imply, and with theaddition of days this means integrity of light, perfection ofcharity and ardour; and thus does David prophesy when hesings, “Full days shall be found in them,” not because theyare of longer life than evil and perverse men, for these weoften find exceed the good, but because they attain to seethe fulfilment of their desires, the fruit of their works inabundance, their labours converted into glory, and that atlength they attain what they sought after, since indeed forthese things is length of life granted.

Our Jerome nowbeholds all things fulfilled: now does he enjoy all that hissoul so greatly desired, and finds himself in that most happyport, to which he had directed the course of his ship withunfurled sails.After the saintly King David had left disposed anddistributed the wealth for the expenses of the building ofthe Temple, the gold, silver, and the many other metalsnecessary for the erection of the House wherein God wasto dwell, he ordered the music of singers and minstrels forthe Royal Palace of the Majesty Divine, having receivedthe outlines and plans from heaven and delivered them tohis son Solomon, assessing the plans and the outlines;and, after having vanquished his enemies and establisheda great peace among the people of Israel, the holy Scripturessay of him,” that he died at a good old age, full of days, ofriches, and of glory. And similarly may we say the sameof our saint now, that after he had enriched the Church bythe gold and silver of his writings, full of wisdom and eloquence, and discovered the treasures of the holy Scriptures,drawing them forth from the depths of the Hebrew tongueand the Chaldean with his admirable translations: after heafforded us so great a knowledge of recondite mysteries, andhad ordained and set the various offices of the Church, withsketches and plans, which had come down from heaven forthe beautifying of so grand a Temple, arranging the chantsand the harmony of the Divine Worship, setting in orderand good style all that we find in it beautiful and admirable: after he had hurled down so many heretics, the capitalenemies of the Church, and confounded so many Jewishpersecutors of Christ, and left such a wealth for those whoshould take advantage of it, and continue the construction—full of days and of glory, at a good old age, full of riches,I Paralip. xxiii. usq. in finem.2 U658THE LIFE OF ST.

We may well say of him thathe is in the Church what Beseleel was in the atcient tabernacle, of whom Holy Scripture tells us that God called himby his name, which is to say, that he ëhose him from outall the sons of Israel, and his name signifies this, for in ourtongue it sounds Besleel, in the shadow of the strong: inorder that we should understand that He filled him with Hisbreath and gave him science for all that he should have toconstruct.Hence the same text goes on to say that Godfilled him with His spirit, with wisdom, understanding,prudence, skill, and knowledge, in order that, invested withso many gifts, he should be a general master in all that construction, devise and dispose what should be needed in gold,silver, and brass, iron, wood, silk, linen, and wool; in all theseworks he had a hand, for all things he had sufficient wealth;to all did he apportion work, and taught what had to bedone: he was master general of that Fabric of God, theoriginal of which the same God Himself taught to Moseson the Mount, although not given to them at the time,but reserved for these happy times of the Gospel, sincethey were no more than the figure and outline.All thisis a vivid picture of what occurred in the case of Jerome.There is no one thing in this great tabernacle (which wasplanted by the hand of God and not by that of man), as St.Paul says when alluding to this, in which St. Jerome wasnot a Beseleel. God called him by his name; He separatedhim and chose him from a thousand peoples, and, as we saidin the commencement of this work, by his name God signified all this to us that we have seen during the course of hisExod. xxxi. and xxxv.DEATH OF ST. JEROME659life. He filled him with His spirit. He gave him eloquence,skill, gift of tongues, wisdom, and he placed his hand in allthe various work Which were to be done in the House ofGod, whether of gold or silver or any other metal: in allthings he took a hand; in all things was he the master, head,and architect.

Here below we have only assumed to draw a sketchof your noble deeds, for, whereas in this life you never soughtto win the glory of men, the Lord whom you served willlaud you (as He has promised) before His Father. TheRoman Breviary, which the whole Church has with so muchjustice adopted as the legitimate offspring of this gloriousFather, affirms in the lessons which are read on the feast ofthis saintly doctor that he died illustrious in sanctity andin miracles.This confirms what the above quoted letteron his departure and death says: “Therein are relatedmany marvels, and though some of them may appearnot altogether in reason, of others we cannot possibly haveany doubt.” Who can doubt but that our Lord would workmany miracles through the intercession of His great servantJerome? God works these miracles for two ends—in orderto impart authority to doctrine and give it force, and tothe end that the people should respect and reverence theThis did He promise in the last words Heminister.uttered to his apostles, when speaking to them.

A sweetfragrance was diffused around, and during the night a largeDEATH OF ST. JEROME661number of the servants of God, monks, and religious ofvarious nations and countries who had already gathered inBethlehem at the news and report of his illness, watchedand prayed, singing without ceasing what they had learnedfrom him.There resounded throughout the building amurmur of divers choirs, confused and devotional. Somesang in Hebrew, others in Syriac, others again in Arabic,in Latin, and in Greek, as well as in many other strangelanguages: indeed that church was like Mount Sion,where the Holy Ghost distributed the gift of languages,although it were only the dead man who could of himselfhave given the responses in all these tongues. Whenmorning broke, all joined together and celebrated the mostsolemn requiem, and then they took the saintly body andlaid it in the spot which he himself had chosen and givenorders he should be laid, the spot his soul had desiredin life, and in death he did not wish to quit that holy cribwhere he had experienced the delightful joys of contemplation. At the actual moment of placing the body in itsgrave, a person born blind received his sight by merelytouching the body. A youth who was deaf and dumb, onkissing the saint's feet found himself freed from boththese impediments. Out of the bodies of some who werepossessed came forth evil spirits howling, and complaining of the violence that Jerome was exercising in castingthem out; and in truth they had no reason of complaint,since they ought to have borne in mind that they themselveshad laboured hard to drive him out of the desert and outof Rome, and they even strove to turn him out of Bethlehem,although this was not permitted them, and it was now fulltime that he should repay them and be himself the one tocast them out of the dwellings so unjustly possessed. Manyother marvels, and miracles without number, it is said didGod perform through His great servant Jerome in those early662THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEIt has been observed in many cases that the devilsdays.are in great fear of him, and to such an extreme that theydare not enter into dwellings or places where his image orThis fact is so universally admitted thatpicture is kept.few saints have their images or pictures so frequently seenas that of St. Jerome, because it is held as certain that it isone of the most powerful means against the attacks andviolence of the evil spirits, and other equally evilly disposedmen and women whom the devil employs as his ministersto work evil.Furthermore, as he was so celebrated forhis penance, Christians delight to have his image beforethem to spur them on to imitate him and follow his example.It remains now to us, at the end of this history, toascertain, if possible, the date of the death of the saint,and at what age he passed into eternity. Among graveauthors it is the general opinion that his death took placein the year 420 of our Redeemer, when Theodosius II.was Emperor in the East, in the ninth year of his consulship,and the third of that of Constantine, and that he died atIn this they follow St. Prosper,the age of ninety-one.who states this in his Chronicle, and, forasmuch as he is avery grave author, and a contemporary, great credit shouldbe given him; moreover, the renown in which St. Jeromewas held was so great that his death must have made thatyear memorable and noteworthy.This agrees with whatI am about to state here, and with what I have observedWhen PaulinOrosius was with our glorious doctor in Bethlehem, havingbeen sent by St. Augustine to discuss with him the doubtsthat had arisen in respect to the origin of souls, whenRome had been entered not only by Alaric, but even byAdolphus who succeeded him; and after this king had beenin Rome, and from thence had sped through Italy andSt. Augustine and in other authors.DEATH OF ST. JEROME663part of France as far as Narbonne, where he dwelt for sometime; and after the conferences and interviews held bySt. Jerome with Orosius (as we have stated already), it isproved that Adolphus had already met his death at the handsof his soldiers—that, at least, all these events must havehappened about the year 417 of our Redeemer. At thisdate St. Zosimus had been Pope, and I believe Bonifacealso. When St. Augustine sent Orosius he had come toCesarea in Mauritania by mandate of the said Zosimus,where the Council was celebrated which is called the sixthCarthaginian, not because it was celebrated in Carthage,but because Cesarea was under that metropolis and in thatprovince.It had commenced in the time of Innocent,and was against Pelagius, and was continued during thepontificates of Zosimus and Boniface, which by all accountswas about the year 418 or 419, and Boniface died in 423.The words of St. Augustine in the Epistle to Optatusof Milevis (after he states that he was writing from Cesareain Mauritania, where he had come by the orders of PopeZosimus) are as follows: “Whereas a great friend of mine(this is understood of Count Marcellinus) had asked whatwere my sentiments in regard to the question of souls, Ifreely confessed to him my ignorance and the doubts I hadin that respect; he then was minded to write to a verylearned man, who dwelt beyond seas, and he repliedThis he said because he was notreferring him to me.Taking advantageaware that he had already asked me.of this opportunity I wrote to him a by no means smallbook asking and beseeching him to teach me first, andThis bookthen send me out to those I was to teach.which I wrote was not as though I was the teacher, butone who is a learner and wishes to acquire knowledge.When it comes back to hand, you may read it, but notAugust, Epist. 46.664THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEmake public, until it may please God I should receive ananswer, and whatever that doctor may judge right I amquite ready prepared to defend.”Most singular is this trust evinced by St. Augustine forthe opinions of St. Jerome, the authority with which heFarther on he adds: “Untilinvests all the acts of his life.either he replies to me, or I, if it so pleases God, shouldattain to learn more, I will not dare to preach or affirmanything.” And farther on still he again declares that PopeZosimus had already condemned by his letters the heresyZosimus lived but three years,of Pelagius and Celestius.and then succeeded Boniface, from 421 or 422, accordingto some accounts.That Paul Orosius was the messengersent by St. Augustine appears evident from Epistle 45which he wrote to St. Jerome; which epistle, owing toits length, he styles book, where he puts the same wordsAt the bewhich we said he had written to Optatus.ginning of this epistle he says: “Although you are ofgreater age than I am, nevertheless, despite that I am agedmyself, I ask of you counsel, because I consider that no ageis too advanced for learning what I have need of, for thoughto those aged it be more becoming in them to teach thanto learn, yet it is better in the end to learn than to remainignorant as to what has to be taught." Then he goes onto say that when he was conceiving a great desire ofwriting and communicating with him, there came to hima young man, a Spaniard, a religious man of lofty intelligence, ordained priest, who was called Orosius, and that itseemed to him he had been sent by Heaven in order to bedespatched to Bethlehem both to learn from St. Jeromewhat he was in search of, as well as by means of himto visit him and communicate his doubts, and take tohim the epistle we have spoken ofFarther on he refersto the epistle written by Marcellinus to Jerome, and whatDEATH OF ST. JEROME665Here St. Augustine calls himself old,he had replied.because, according to what is gathered from his own wordsin his book De Vita beata, he was born in the year 355,and, according to Posidonius in his life of the saint, helived seventy-six years.And whereas this embassy of Orosius took place afterthe death of Adolphus, and in the time of Zosimus, aboutthe year 417, St. Augustine must then have been seventy-twoyears of age, and our saint some twenty years older, or therePaul Orosius returned with his reply to Africa, asabouts.St. Augustine mentions” in Book II. of his Retractations,and this reply (to say it in passing) was to praise the geniusof St. Augustine and to tell him that owing to the greatoccupations he had (I believe in ministering to the poorRomans, who were resorting to him) he could not reply tohim very extensively.Orosius concluded his Hormestamundi when with St. Augustine, and he reached the timesof the Gothic King Walia, and, according to his account,which is that of the Septuagint, the year of creation 5618,and of our Redeemer 419 or 420, which all fits in very well,although the reckoning is not so exact as might be wished.Possibly our saint may have lived, at most, after all theseevents a few days, and however much we may endeavour toextend the time, it could only be up to the year 421 or 422.Having investigated this, and admitting the good reasonsand conjectures advanced, and the authority of such ancientand grave authors, it becomes very difficult to reconcilewhat St. Prosper himself says, that, when the glorioussaint died, he was ninety-one years of age.This isaffirmed by nearly all who treat of his life, and they evengo beyond that age.Bede, Sigebert, Paul deacon, and theRoman Martyrology declare that he was aged ninety-eight,1 August. De Vita beata; Posid., in fin. Vitae August.August. Retract. 2, cap. 43.666THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEand even ninety-nine.Accordingly, we must perforcesay that he was born in the time of Constantine, as wefound at the beginning of this history was said by theseauthors, some in the year 15, others in that of 20, othersagain in the thirtieth of his empire, but which we provedwere false from the words of the self-same doctor, whosaid that when a boy and learning grammar there cameto Rome news of the death of Julian the Apostate, fromwhich we inferred that he must have been fifteen or sixteenyears of age, and, as all agree that Julian died in 363, St.Jerome was born in the year 346 or 347 at best, and thus asto the year 422 there only intervenes seventy-six years;hence it is manifest that we must needs deduct at leastfourteen years from the age all ascribe to him he hadattained, which is indeed a great difference: and if it be anerror, it is a great error, and does not seem to agree with thestatement St. Augustine makes of the saint's great age, andwith what all imagine him to have reached, and even withwhat the saint himself depicts in many passages of his works.In order to correct the discrepancy of years and settle thedifficulty it appears to me that the solution given by a modernauthor when investigating this question is very trite. Hesays very properly” that when Julian died St. Jerome musthave been twenty and not fifteen years of age, and not a boy,as his words would seem to imply: because the saint in hiswritings at times employs figures and manners of speechwhich are called amplification and attenuation, and of thesehe employs many when he in his old age refers to what hedid in his youth; thus when he said he was a boy andstudied grammar at the time when the news came of thedeath of the Cesar, it was attenuation, calling himself aboy, although he was twenty, which is a usual mannerof old men, and thus means by grammar the humanBaronius, t. 4, annal 6, Damasi, papae.DEATH OF ST. JEROME667sciences, dialectics, rhetoric, the Greek tongue, and otherstudies, which at the time he was pursuing. And so thatit be not thought that he spoke at random, or superficially,he brings forward many passages, where he expresseshimself in similar phrases.Writing to Nepotian hesays thus: “When I was a youth, or rather a boy, andrepressed the impulses of that wanton age by the hard lifeof the desert, I wrote an epistle to your uncle, Heliodorus.”Whence it is seen that he refers to writing an epistle whenin the desert, being then thirty years of age, yet he callsIn the Commentaries on Isaiah, referringhimself a boy.to the great earthquake, which occurred in the times ofValentinian and Valens, about the year 365, he says ofhimself” that he was an infant, and at the very least he wassixteen or seventeen years of age.Oftentimes does St.Jerome call himself infant and boy speaking figuratively, orto signify how little in his estimation he had acquired, orthe imperfections of things learned. Thus also does he callhimself “a boy,” and “small one,” when he wrote the Commentaries on Abdias,” yet he was over thirty then; andsimilarly does he call himself a boy, when he was studyingrhetoric and exercised himself in declamation and otherstudies of dialectics and philosophy; and until the time whenbeing in the desert he commenced his studies of the Hebrewlanguage he speaks of himself as a lad, because all had beengiven up for the study of Cicero, Pliny, Fronto, Aristotle,and Plato, alluding slily to the proverb of the Egyptians,Graeci semper pueri, because they did not rise to theknowledge of things divine, and were for ever studyingthe elements of the world and polished speech, which areall boyish things.Hence it is seen that, although he maystyle himself a boy, and declare he was studying grammarwhen Julian died, it does not thereby prejudice the factEpist. 2.Super., cap. 15 Isaia.Epist. 4 and 12o.668THE LIFE OF ST. JEROMEthat he might be at least twenty or thirty years old.Thisis in truth a very good conjecture and conclusion to cometo, and the best that can be given, because it is so clear,for the reasons already stated, that he did not live beyondthe year 422, we must put his birth at the year 341, andtherefore he died at the age of eighty-one years, which isThis age of eighty-one yearsas far as it can be extended.is the last of the climacterics composed of nine nines, andin this year our glorious Father and great doctor of theChurch passed from the last step or rung of the ladder ofnines to join the nine choirs of angels, where he will forever praise with them the most Blessed Trinity, intoningin heaven that verse which he himself taught us to singGloria Patri et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto.upon earth:Sicut erat in principio et nunc, et semper, et in saculasaculorum.—Amen.THE ENDLA US DEO SEMPERPrinted by R. & R.
