INTRODUCTIONWHEN  in  the  year  1876  I edited,  for the  Royal  Societyof Literature,  the  Chronicle  of Adam  of Usk,  for  the  firsttime,  from  the  unique  text  in  the  Additional  MS.  10,104Thein  the  British  Museum,  I was  at  a  disadvantage.end  of the  MS.  was  missing,  and  the  chronicle  broke  offabruptly  in the  narrative  of events  of the  year  1404.Itwould  then  have  appeared  rash  to  entertain  a  hope  thatThe  MS.the  missing  portion  would  ever  be  recovered.had  already  been  in the  possession  of the British  Museumfor forty years;  and  who  could  say  how  many  more  hadelapsed  before  that  period  since  the  mutilation  of  thevolume?  But  in the  world  of letters,  as  in  other  depart-ments  of  human  affairs,  the  unexpected  happens  with@  surprising  persistency.In  1885,  a  quire  of  vellumleaves,  carelessly  folded  up,  was  found  among  a  numberof  neglected  documents  in a loft  at  Belvoir  Castle,  atthe  time  when  the  Duke  of  Rutland’s  collection  ofpapers  was  being  examined  and  calendared  for  theHistorical  Manuscripts  Commission,  and  this  eventuallyproved  to  be  the  missing  portion  of the  Additional  MS.and  to  contain  the  end  of  Adam  of  Usk’s  chronicle.Its  true  character,  however,  was  not  recognized  untilquite  recently;  and  I  have  to  thank  my  friend,  SirHenry  Maxwell-Lyte,  K.C.B.,  the  Deputy  Keeper  ofPublic  Records,  for  his  kindness  in  communicating  thediscovery  to  me,  and  His  Grace  the  Duke  of  RutlandviINTRODUCTIONfor  permission  to  copy  and  publish  the  text.To  theRoyal  Society  of  Literature,  which  had  generouslyundertaken  the  first  publication  of  the  chronicle  whoseauthorship  I  had  then  identified,  I  naturally  turnedagain  with  the  new  material  in  my  hand.  The  Societyhas  repeated  its  generosity  and  has  undertaken  theissue  of  this  second  and  complete  edition  of  Adam  ofUsk’s  work  with  a  liberality  which  entitles  it  to  thegratitude  of all  students  of  English  history.  My  senseof personal  obligation  to  the  Society  I cannot  adequatelyexpress.The  Additional  MS.  10,104  was  purchased  for  theBritish  Museum  at  the  sale  of  the  library  of  RichardHeber,  in  February,  1836,  being  lot  833  of  the  Manu-There  is no  record  to  show  how  Heber  acquiredscripts.It  is  a  folio  measuring  143  by  93  inchesthe  volume.It  contains  the  Poly-and  consisting  of  177  leaves.chronicon,  or  “  Historia  Policronica,’  of  Ralph  Higden,ending  with  the  close  of  Edward  the  third’s  reign,  andpreceded  by an  index,  a  note  of the five  ages  of the  worldprevious  to  the  birth  of Christ,  and  a  map  of the  world.The  first  page  of each  of the  seven  books  into  which  thework  is  divided  is  decorated  with  an  initial  and  borderThe  handwriting,  which  is  of  thein  gold  and  colours.usual  character  employed  for  works  of  this  nature,  isof  the  end  of the  fourteenth  century.In  the  margins,besides  the  ordinary  key-notes  which  may  be  regardedas  an  integral  part  of the  text,  various  other  notes  havebeen  added  from  time  to  time  by different  hands;  andit  is  not  impossible  that  some  of them  may  have  beenwritten  by Adam  of Usk himself,  who  owned  the chronicleand  who  bequeathed  it, as  we  shall  see,  to  his  kinsmanEdward  ap  Adam.  At  the  foot  of  the  first  page  ofINTRODUCTIONViithe  first  book  of  the  Polychronicon  Adam’s  shield  ofarms:  sable,  a  naked  man  (Adam,  the  father  of mankind)delving,  has  been  drawn  in  a  very  rough  style,  probablynot  by Adam  himself,  but  possibly  by his  legatee.  ThePolychronicon  occupies  154  leaves;  and  on  two  leaveswhich  had  been  left  blank  at  the  end of it, and  on  a  suffi-cient  number  of  supplementary  leaves,  Adam’s  chronicleis written.The  wooden  covers  of  the  original  bindingstill  remain,  but  cased  with  leather  of modern  date.We  now  turn  to  Adam’s  chronicle.This,  as  we  knowfrom  his  own  references,  he  intended  to  serve  as  a  sup-plement  to  Higden’s  work.  But  the  text  is  not  in  hishandwriting;  it  is  written  by  several  scribes,  none  ofthem  good  writers,  and  some  of  them  illiterate.It  isnot  improbable  that  Adam  may  have  left  instructionsto his  legatee,  Edward  ap Adam,  to  have  his  compilationcopied into  the volume,  from a reluctance  (if not  modesty)that  “this  record  of his  foolishness”!  should  appear  inhis  lifetime.As  already  stated,  the  text  in  the  Addi-tional  MS.  breaks  off  in  the  narrative  of the  year  1404,The  quire  which  has  been  recovered  at  Belvoir  Castlecarries  on  the  chronicle  to  the  year  1421;  but  the  latterpart  is very  meagre,  and  is  rather  in  the  nature  of dis-connected  memoranda  of particular  events  than  of  his-torical  narrative.Although  Adam  lived  nine  years  laterthan  the  conclusion  of his  chronicle,  he was  by this  timeThe  newan  old  man  and  he  noted  nothing  further.material  occupies  eleven  of  the  twelve  pages  of  theBelvoir  quire,  and  the  handwriting,  like  that  of  theearlier part of the text,  is by different  scribes,  degeneratingat the  end  into  a  slovenly  scrawl.The  date  of  the  MS.of the  chronicle,  as  a whole,  may  be about  1440-1450.1  See  p.  219.ViliINTRODUCTIONThe  text  throughout  has  key-notes,  corrections,  andsome  additions,  written  in the  margins  in  various  hands.The  latest  in  date  are  some  which  appear  both  in  thevolume  and  in  the  newly-found  quire  in  handwritingof  the  latter  part  of  the  sixteenth  century;  and  theirpresence  in both  portions  of the  text  proves  that  at  leastat the  time  when  they were  written  the  Additional  MS.was  intact.Neither  in the  Heber  sale-catalogue  nor  in  the  official“List  of  Additions  to  the  Manuscripts  in  the  BritishMuseum  in  the  years  1836-1840”  was  the  authorship  ofAdam  of Usk  identified.The  clue  was  first  afforded  bycertain  notes,  or  sentences,  more  or  less  illiterate,  whichare  entered  in  the  MS.  immediately  after  the  Poly-chronicon  and  form  a  kind  of  introduction  to  Adam’schronicle.These  consist  in  the  first  place  of  a  seriesof  references  to  Adam,  the  father  of  mankind,  and  toothers  of  the  same  name,  with  citations  from  the  HolyScriptures,  from  Gratian’s  “  Decretum,”  and  from  theFathers.The  following  examples  are  selected  :—“Adam  de  quo  sancta  refert  Trinitas:  ‘Factus  est  Adamquasi  unus  ex  nobis.’?Gen.  j.”“  Ade  solius  felix  culpa  et  felix  delictum,  secundum  sanctumGregorium.”“Adam  tunica  pellicia  se  vestivit:  de  pe.  di.  j. medicina  ”[Gratian,  Decretum:  de penitentia,  distinctio  j., cap.  1xxx].“Ade  felicibus  translacionis  assencibus  a  Herefordiensi  ad‘Wygorniensem,  et  a Wygorniensi  ad Wyntoniensem,  canit  quidamemulus:‘Trigamus  est  Adam  talem  suspendere  vadam.Thomam  neglexit,  Wolstanum  non  bene  rexit,Cur?Swythinum  maluit.Quia  plus  valuit.’”?1  See  p. 277.?

But  thereare  also,  in  addition  to  some  historical  memoranda,  thefollowing  verses  which  seem  to  be  several  attempts  tocompose  an  epitaph  in  honour  of  our  chronicler—allwritten  in  a  cramped  and  feeble  hand,  and  all  of  themvile  literary  productions.One  would  be  pleased,  froma  feeling  of  sentiment,  to  imagine  that  here  we  mayhave  specimens  of Adam's  own  composition—greater  menthan  he  have  yielded  to  the  temptation  of writing  theirown  epitaphs—but  jealousy  for his  reputation  as  a  scholarshould  forbid  the  idea,  although  the  period  of the  hand-writing  might  fall  within  that  of his  closing  years  :—“O  dolor  immensus;  satis  ars  vel  gloria  sensus;Non  rediment  census,  quin  casus  sit  tibi  pensus.Sortitum  nostri  prothoplausti  nomen,  ab  indeUsk  dictum,  sub  se  continet  iste  lapis.”Justiniane,  tuas  leges  docuit,  vice  fungensDoctoris,  necnon  jus,  Graciane,  tuum.”“Qui  docui  mores  mundi  vitare  favores,)Inter  doctores  sacros  sortitus  honores,Vermibus  hic  ponor,  et  sic  ostendere  conorQuod,  sicut  hic  ponor,  sic  ponitur  omnis  honor.”?  “honores  ”  seems  to have  been  written  at  first,  and  then  clumsilyaltered  into  “  favores.”INTRODUCTIONxi“Legit  hic  Oxonie  doctor  civilia  jura;Hic  jacet  in  requie,  vivat  sine  fine  futura.”?From  the  details  which  our  author  himself incidentallysupplies  of  his  own  career,  and  from  modern  research,and  especially  from  the  patient  investigations  prose-cuted  by Mr.  J.  H.  Wylie  for  his  “  History  of Henry  theFourth,”  the  outline  of Adam  of Usk’s  life  may  be drawnwith  some  accuracy.?But,  first,  it should  be  noted  thatdocumentary  evidence  now  shows  that  his  name  wasnearly  always  written  as  Adam  Usk,  rather  than  Adamde  Usk.As, however,  he  has  become  familiar  to  us  asAdam  of  Usk,  and  for  a  quarter  of  a  century  has  beenreferred  to by that  designation,  let  his  name  so  stand.He  was  a  native  of  Usk  in  Monmouthshire,  but  theexact  date  of  his  birth  can  only be  conjectured.In theejaculatory  preface  to  his  account  of  his  departure  forRome  in  February,  1402,  he  refers  to  himself  as  havingarrived  at  the  period  of  old  age  and  decay  (“senecta  etsenium,”  p.  74).  Such  an  expression  in  modern  dayswould  imply  a  greater  age  than  it  did  in  the  middleages,  when  men  were  wont  to  regard  themselves  as  oldat  a  period  of  life  which  we  consider  comparativelyyoung.  Adam  may,  then,  have  been  about  fifty years  ofage  when  he  left  England,  and  we  may  venture  to  placethe  year  of his  birth  about  1852.  He  owed  his  first  stepin  life  to  his  patron,  Edmund  Mortimer,  third  earl  ofMarch  (a.p.  1860-13881),  who  held  the  lordship  of  Uskin  right  of  his  wife  Philippa  of  Clarence  claimingthrough  her  mother,  Elizabeth  de Burgh,  of the  family  of1  The  presence  of reference  letters  (a and b) in the  margin  seems  toindicate  that  the  fourth  attempt  should  precede  the  second  in order.I take  this  opportunity  of  expressing  my  grateful  thanks  to  myfriend  Mr.  Hubert  Hall  for  his  valuable  assistance  in  searching  therecords  at the  Public  Record  Office.xiiINTRODUCTIONClare,  and  who  presented  him  to  an  exhibition  in  lawsat  Oxford  (p. 22).  Supposing  Adam  to  have  been  thena  lad  of,  say,  sixteen  years,  he  would  have  commencedhis  university  career  about  1368.  He  eventually  tookthe  degree  of  doctor  of  laws,  for  which  he  kept  thethree  years’  course  (pp.  74,  242),  that  is,  after  beingadmitted  bachelor.  He  could  not  have  attained  to  thehigher  degree  in  less  than  twelve  years  from  the  dateof  his  first  entering  the  university;  and  he  probablyresided  somewhat  longer.  The  fact  that  he  was  ap-pointed  a  notary  (pp.  3, 189)  by cardinal  Pileo  di  Pratain  1381  seems  to  suggest  that,  by that  time,  he had  risento  some  position  and  had  taken  the  degree  of doctor.The  details  of  Adam’s  life  in  the  succeeding  yearsare  scanty.In  1387  we  learn  that  he  was  residing  inOxford  (pp. 6, 145)  as  an  “extraordinary”  in  canon  Jaw,presumably  as  lecturer  for  the  “  extraordinary  ”  lectures  ;and  in  1388  and  1389  he was  implicated  as  a  ringleaderin  the  feud  of  the  Welsh  and  southerners  against  thenorthern  scholars.From  these  references  it  may  beinferred  that,  after  taking  his  doctor’s  degree,  he  eitherremained  in,  or  soon  returned  to,  Oxford,  and  residedthere  for  some  years,  being  engaged  in  universityThis  view  is  supported  by  the  remark  thatteaching.he  incidentally  makes,  in  connection  with  Chicheley’sadvancement  to the  see  of Canterbury  (pp.  123, 303),  thatit  was  to  him  that  he  handed  over  his  chair  of  civilUnless  Adam  is  speaking  carelessly,  we  mustlaw.regard  this  civil  chair  as  a  further  advancement  on  theappointment  he  had  held  as  “extraordinarius.”’Now,Chicheley  took  the  degree  of  bachelor  of  laws  early  in1390,  and  he  therefore  could  not  have  held  the  chairbefore  that  time;  and  he  went  out  of residence  in  theINTRODUCTIONxiiimiddle  of  1892.  Adam,  then,  must  have  vacated  hisappointment  in Chicheley’s  favour  between  those  dates.After  this  he  practised  for  seven  years  in  the  court  ofCanterbury,  as  he  informs  us  (pp. 74,  242),  apparentlyfrom  1392  to  1899;  for  in  the  latter  year,  when  he  waspresented  by  archbishop  Arundel  to  the  church  ofKemsing,  he  was  styled  “curiae  nostrae  Cantuariensisadvocatus.”  !Adam  was  present  in the parliament  held  in SeptemberIt  isof  1397;  but  he  does  not  say  in  what  capacity.most  probable,  however,  that  he  was  there  in  someconnection  with  archbishop  Arundel  and  his  brotherRichard,  earl  of Arundel,  both  of whom  then  fell  underthe  king’s  vengeance,  the  former  being  banished  andthe  latter  losing  his  life.  The  regretful  terms  in  whichAdam  refers  to  the  earl’s  death  (pp.  15,  159)  indicateHis  rela-his personal  interest  in  that  unfortunate  man.tions  with  the  Arundels  are  explained  by  the  allianceof their  house  with  the  Mortimers;  Philippa,  daughterof Edmund,  earl  of  March,  Adam’s  patron,  and  herselfhis  patron  also,  having  been  married,  in  1391,  as  hissecond  wife,  to  this  same  earl  of  Arundel.?Indeed,we  may  assume  that  from  the  time  when  the  familiesof  Arundel  and  Mortimer  were  thus  brought  into  such1  Lambeth  Palace  library:  Arundel  register,  i. 263.?  She  had  previously  been  the  wife  of  John  Hastings,  earl  ofPembroke,  who  was  killed  in  a  tournament,  and,  after  Arundel'sexecution,  she  married  as  a  third  husband  Thomas  Poynings,  baronSt.  John.Adam  of  Usk  also  seems  to  have  had  his  enemies  among  themembers  of the Arundel  family.  Forsome  unknown  reason  he dislikedthe  lady  Bergavenny,  who  was  Joan,  wife  of  William  Beauchamp,baron  Bergavenny,  and  daughter,  by  his  first  wife,  of  the  aboveRichard,  earl  of Arundel.He  calls  her  a  second  Jezebel  (pp. 63, 228).Her  curious  will,  which  suggests  a  masterful  character  in  the  lady,is printed  by Dugdale,  Baronage,  i. 240.xivINTRODUCTIONclose  bonds,  Adam,  as  a  clergyman,  would  have  enjoyedthe  protection  of  Arundel,  archbishop  then  of  Yorkand,  in  1396,  of  Canterbury.  That  at  a  later  date  hebenefited  by  the  archbishop’s  patronage  and  was  hisdependent  down  to  the  day of Arundel’s  death  is  suffi-ciently  shown  in  the  course  of this  chronicle.It seems,then,  quite  a  natural  thing  to  find  him,  on  his  nextappearance,  in  company  with  the  archbishop  at  Bristolin the  train  of Henry  Bolingbroke,  whose  march  north-ward  to  Chester  he  followed.  With  a  certain  tone  ofself-importance  Adam  has  described  some  incidentsduring  this  progress  in  which  he  personally  took  part.At  Usk,  his  native  place,  he  secured  the  submission  ofthe  inhabitants  to Henry,  who  had  threatened  to  pillagetheir  country  in  punishment  for  the  resistance  whichthey had  been  prepared  to  offer  at  the  instigation  of thelady  of  the  place,  who  was  Alianore,  the  daughter  ofThomas  Holland,  earl  of  Kent,  king  Richard’s  half-brother,  and  widow  of  Roger  Mortimer,  fourth  earl  ofMarch,This  lady  was  now  married  to  her  secondhusband,  sir  Edward  de Cherleton,  who  appears  at  a  latertime  under  the  title  of the  lord  of Powis,  and  for  whomAdam  claims  to  have  obtained,  on  this  occasion,  thefavour  of Bolingbroke  (pp. 25,  174).  At  Ludlow  he againused  his  influence  with  Henry  and  archbishop  Arundelfor  the  release  of Thomas  Prestbury  from  prison  and  forhis  promotion  as  abbot  of  Shrewsbury.Arrived  atChester,  Adam  seems  to  have  combined  his  duties  asa  priest  in  the  celebration  of  mass  with  the  apparentlynot  uncongenial  occupation  of joining  in  the  search  forand  plunder  of the  hidden  goods  of the  inhabitants.At  this  point  we  should  note  the  benefices  held  byAdam  of  Usk  down  to  this  period,  so  far  as  they  haveINTRODUCTIONXVbeen  ascertained.First,  we  find  that  on  the  11th  Sep-tember,  1383,  he was  presented  to  the  church  of MitchelTroy  in  Monmouthshire,  in  the  diocese  of Llandaff,  thenin  the  king’s  gift  by reason  of  the  wardship  of  Roger,heir  of the  late  Edmund  Mortimer,  third  earl  of March’.This  living  he  exchanged  on  the  21st  September,  1385,for  that  of  Babcary  in  Somersetshire,  in  the  diocese  ofBath  and  Wells*;  but  how  long  he  held  the  latter  doesnot  appear,  and  whether  it  was  this  or  some  otherbenefice  that  he  exchanged,  in  1396,  for  the  rectory  ofCastle  Combe  in  Wiltshire,  in  the  diocese  of  Salisbury,remains  uncertain.At  all events  in that year  he is foundin possession  of the  church  of Castle  Combe,  by exchangewith  the  incumbent  Henry  Pake;  and  he  seems  to  haveheld  it  till  the  year  1408,  when  the  name  of  Ralph  deDerham  appears  as  rector®.It  is  to  be  noted  that  thepatron  of  this  living  was  sir  Stephen  Scrope,  to  whomwe  shall  have  to make  reference  at a  later  stage of Adam’scareer*,  In addition  to the rectory of Castle  Combe,  Adamwas  presented,  under  papal  dispensation,  by  Philippa,daughter  of  Edmund  Mortimer,  earl  of  March,  and  nowlady  St.  John,  who  has  been  mentioned  above,  tothe  living  of West  Hanningfield  in Essex,  in the  dioceseof  London,  probably  early  in  the  year  1899;  not  longbefore  that  lady’s  death,  which  took  place  in  1400,  ashe  himself  tells  us  (pp.  55,  217).He  almost  at  onceexchanged  West  Hanningfield  for  Shire  Newton  inMonmouthshire,  in  the  diocese  of  Llandaff,  on  the  24thOctober,  1399,  the  incumbent  of  the  latter  being  JohnKyrkton®;  and  again,  on  the  24th  November  of  the1  Pat.

Mar.,  1404.bxviiiINTRODUCTIONgiving  a title  to the  Lancastrian  succession  (pp. 30,  182).And  an  interesting  incident  recorded  at  this  time  isAdam’s  visit  to the  Tower  and  admission  to the  presenceof the  imprisoned  king  not  long  before  his  deposition.That  Adam  was  present  at  that  great  historical  event  inparliament  is  most  probable,  although  he  does  not  actu-ally  say  so;  but  he  does  mention  his  attendance  inHenry’s  first  parliament  and  at  his  coronation,  in  con-nection  with  which  ceremony  he  was  retained  by  sirThomas  Dymock  to draw  his  petition  for the  champion-ship  (pp.  85,  188).All  through  these  events  we  maypresume  that  he was  more  or  less  in communication  withthe  archbishop,  on  whose  restoration  to  the  primacy  hehas  some  observations  and  gives  a  graphic  account  of theejectment  from  Lambeth  palace  of  the  armorial  devicesof the  dispossessed  prelate  Roger  Walden  (pp.  38,  192),whose  submission  he  witnessed  and  to  whose  worthycharacter  he bears  testimony.Adam’s  services  as  a  lawyer  were  required  from  timeto time  on  public  business.  On  the  23rd  February,  1400,we  find  him  appointed  one  of  a  commission  to  hear  anappeal  from  a  judgement  of  the  military  court  of  Bor-deaux!;  and  in  September  of  the  same  year  he  wascalled  on  for  an  opinion  on  the  question  of  the  reim-bursement  to  France  of  the  portion  of  the  dower  ofRichard’s  young  widow,  queen  Isabella,  which  was  repay-able  in default  of issue  of the  marriage,  and which  Henrywould  have  been glad to find some  excuse  for withholding(pp. 48,  209).  Nine  months  later  Adam  saw  the  youngprincess  depart  on  her  homeward  journey,  “showing  acountenance  of lowering and  evil aspect to king Henry,andscarce  opening  her lips, as  she went  her way ”  (pp. 63, 229).1  Pat.  Rolls,  1 Hen.

And  again,  in  1401,  heappeared  for lord  Grey  of Ruthin  in  his  long  and  costlysuit  in the  court  of chivalry  to  substantiate  his  claim  tobear  the  arms  of Hastings;  and  also,  in a  similar  armor-ial  action,  for  sir  Walter  Byttervey  against  sir  JohnColvylle  of Dale  (a Shakespearean  character).Adam  was  by no  means  unconscious  of his  own  legalacquirements,  and  certainly  missed  no  occasion  for airinghis  knowledge.The  way  in which  he parades  the  decre-tals  in  convocation  is  amusing  (pp.  44,  204);  and  stillmore  so  is his  attempt  to overwhelm  the  German  envoy,on  the  delicate  question  of the  recent  imperial  election,with  citations  from  the  same  authorities,  when  the  bishopof Hereford  opportunely  came  to  the rescue  of the  embar-rassed  diplomatist  and  bade  the  officious  Adam  hold  hispeace  (pp.  59,  223).But,  granting  that  our  chronicler  was  a  competent  \lawyer, he was  hardly  a wise  man,  and  he was  certainly  ofThe  marvellousa  particularly  credulous  disposition.Prophecies  ofappeals  to  him  in  its  most  simple  forms.Bridlington  and  others  are  solemnly vouched.  Wonderfuleggs,  a  two-headed  calf,  a  one-eyed  boy, the  spontaneousringing  of bells,  a  stream  flowing  blood,  are  all faithfullyrecorded.More  valuable  is  his  story  of king  Richard’sgreyhound  (pp.  41,  196);  and  the.  ominous  incidentswhich  attended  that  monarch’s  coronation  (pp.  42,  200)b2xxINTRODUCTIONas well  as the coronation  of Henry the fourth  (pp. 119, 298)are  at  least  interesting,  even  if they  are  not  authentic.A seer  of visions  and  a  dreamer  of dreams,  Adam  has  onevery  fitting  occasion  a dream  or vision  to recount,  whichat least  does  credit  to  his  imagination.To his native  town  of Usk he was  affectionately attached.He  himself  tells  us  of  his  gift  to  the  church  of  certainservice  books  and  vestments,  the  latter  broidered  (a touchof vanity!)  with  his  armorial  bearings  which  testified  hisdescent  from  his  namesake  Adam,  the  father  of mankind:on  a  field  sable,  a  naked  man  delving  (pp.  56,  219).Again,  when  in  Rome,  he  obtained  an  indulgence  infavour  of the  nunnery  of  Usk  (pp.  93,  268),  which  hadbeen  reduced  to poverty  by the Welsh  wars.  And  in theend he was  buried  in Usk  church.  His  full  account  of thedeath  of John  Usk,  abbot  of Chertsey  (pp. 46, 207),  wouldsuggest  some  relationship:  and  the  selection,  for  specialmention,  of the  name  of  Thomas  Usk  (pp.  6, 146)  wouldmake  us  wish  to  believe  that  our  writer  was  connectedwith  the  author  of the  “Testament  of  Love.”But  themost  that  we  can  assume  is  that  they  were  fellowtownsmen.The  last  public  employment  of Adam  which  has  to benoticed,  before  the  event  which  compelled  his  retirementto  foreign  lands,  was  an  inquiry  into  a  scandal  in  thepriory  of  Nuneaton  (pp.  57, 220) which  he was  called  onby the  archbishop  of Canterbury  to  undertake  in associa-tion  with  an  interesting  personage,  Philip  Repyngdon,the  quondam  follower  of Wycliffe,  abbot  of Leicester  andking  Henry’s  chaplain  and  confessor,  who  afterwardsbecame  bishop of Lincoln.  No  doubt  it was  the connection  |thus  brought  about  between  the  two  men  that  enabledAdam  to give in his  chronicle  the  text  of the  remarkableINTRODUCTIONxxiletter  of remonstrance  which  Repyngdon  addressed  tothe  king  (pp. 65, 281).We  now  arrive  at  the  year  1402,  when  Adam  abruptlyannounces,  without  giving  any  reason,  his  departure,  inFebruary,  for Rome.  It isto  Mr. Wylie’s  minute  investi-gations  that  we  owe  our  knowledge  of the  true  cause  ofthis journey.  Grievous  is  it to have  to relate  that  Adamof Usk, a doctor  of laws of Oxford, a clergyman  of standing,and  one  who  enjoyed  the  protection  of  the  great  andpowerful,  and  who,  we  doubt  not, was  looking  forward  tosubstantial  preferment,  had,  on  the  2nd  November,  1400,taken  to  the  road  in  Westminster  and  stolen  a  horse,colour  black,  saddle  and  bridle,  value  one  hundred  shil-lings,  together  with  the  sum  of fourteen  marks  in  cash,all  the  property  of one  Walter  Jakes;  and  that  Adamand  his  servants,  Edward  Usk  and  Richard  Edoyn,  wereconvicted  as  common  thieves?.1  These  facts  appear  in the pardon  granted,  in 1403, to Edward  Usk.Pat.

Whether  the  culprit  claimedbenefit  of clergy, we  know  not;  probably the  archbishop’sinfluence  served  to protect  him  from  condign  punishment.But  he  had  to  leave  the  country,  an  exile,  to  his  owndishonour  but  to  the  advantage  of  the  narrative  of  hischronicle,  which  from  this  point  contains  an  interestingaccount  of  his  adventures  abroad.It  is  not  improbablethat  Adam  purposely  chose  Rome  as  the  place  of  hisretreat  on  account  of  the  suit  which  was  then  beingprosecuted  against  him  at the  papal  court for the  recoveryof the  rectory  of  Kemsing  and  the  chapel  of  Seal,  andwhich,  as  we  have  seen,  was  soon  afterwards  decided  infavour  of his  opponents.He  took  ship  at  Billingsgate  on  the  19th  February.Two  days  earlier  he  had  found  two  sureties  in £40  eachto  refrain  from  doing  anything  in  the  court  of  Romeprejudicial  to  the  king  or  to  the  laws  and  customs  ofhis  kingdom  of  England  or  to  the  statute  of provisors’.Landing  at  Bergen-op-Zoom,  he  travelled  eastward,through  Diest,  Maastricht,  and  Aachen,  to Cologne, whereno  doubt  he  took  boat  on  the  Rhine,  following  its coursethrough  Bonn,  Coblentz,  Worms,  Speyer,  Strassburg,  andThence,  striking  south,  he  reachedBreisach  to  Basel.Bern,  and  then  journeyed  eastward  to  Lucerne,  where  hewould  have  traversed  the  lake,  and  passed  over  theSt.  Gotthard  “in  an  ox-waggon,  half  dead  with  cold,”Hisdropping  down  on  the  Italian  side  into  Bellinzona.journey  so  far  had  occupied  a  month.  From  Bellinzonahe travelled  southward  through Como, Milan and Piacenza,toBorgo-San-Donnino,  But thence—instead  ofcontinuingto  follow  the  main  road  in  a  south-easterly  direction  to1  Close  Rolls,  3 Hen.

From  the  Calendar  of PapalRegisters!  it  appears  that  these  latter  benefices  wereconferred  on  Adam  by pope  Boniface  on  the  18th August,1404, value altogether  not exceeding  three  hundred  marks;that  he  was  still  rector  of  Castle  Combe,  which  he  hadreceived  licence  to  exchange  at  pleasure;  and  that  hewas  now  holding  that  living,  together  with  a  canonryand  prebend  in  the  diocese  of  St.  Asaph  (which  may  beidentified  with  the  prebend  in  Bangor  MonachorumSt.  Dinoth,  in that  diocese,  if we  are  right  in conjecturingthe  latter  to be the  one  conferred  upon  him  by the  princeof Wales), and certain  others  in Abergwili  (e.g. the canonryand  prebend  of  Llandogo),  value  not  exceeding  eightymarks,  which  last  he  was  to  surrender  on  obtainingpossession  of the  canonry  and  prebend  of  Llanbister.In  the  same  year  1404  the  see  of Hereford  fell  vacantby the  death of  John  Trevenant  on  the  6th  April, and  wasintended  by the  pope  for  Adam  (if we  are  to  believe  hisown  story),  who  attributes  the  failure  of  the  proposal  tothe  envy  and  slander  of his enemies  (pp. 85, 256).  Again,later  in the  same  year,  a  scheme  was  set  on  foot  to  securefor  him,  by papal  provision,  the  bishopric  of  St.  David’s(pp. 92,265);  but again  his  enemies  prevailed,  and nothingcame  of  it.  An  attempt  made  at  this  time  by Adam  togain  Henry’s  favour  by a  submissive  letter  had  no  effect.Meanwhile  pope  Boniface  died  and  was  succeeded  by1  Cal.  Pap.  Reg.,  Pap.

Twemlow,  theeditor  of the  calendar,  for  references  to  material  not  yet  publishedwhich  he has kindly  supplied.INTRODUCTIONXXVAdam’s  friend,  cardinal  dei  Migliorati,  as  Innocent  theseventh,These  events  give  occasion  to  our  chroniclerto  describe,  with  some  curious  details,  the  new  pontiff’selection  and  coronation  and  the  ceremonies  and  publicgames  connected  therewith.Moreover,  the  occasion  wastoo  important  to  be passed  by without  appropriate  dreamson  Adam’s  part,  regarding  both  the  dead  and  the  livingpope,  uncomplimentary  to  the  former  but  favourable  tothe  latter.But  evil  days  were  coming  on  Innocent,  and  Adam  ofUsk  shared  his  misfortunes.In August,  1405,  took  placethe  revolt  of the  Romans  against  the  pope  and  the  flightof the  latter  to  Viterbo.  Poor  Adam  was  left  behind  and,stripped  even  to  his  shoe-latchets,  he  had  to  remain  inhiding  for  some  days,  disguised  as  a  Dominican,  until  hecould  escape  down  the  river,  dressed  as  a  sailor,  and  thusmake  his way to  rejoin  the  pope.  Innocent  seems  to haveappreciated  the  humourous  incongruity  of a  middle-ageddoctor  of laws  masquerading  as  a  common  mariner,  andhad  his  gibes  for  the  unfortunate  fugitive.  Reduced  tosore  straits  by the  flight  from  Rome  of the  merchant  whoacted  as  his  banker  and  deserted  by his  friends,  Adam,while  at Viterbo,  had  a severe  illness, from  which  he onlyrecovered  through  the  humanity of the  pope, who sent  hisown  physician—a  Jew,  it  is  to  be  noted—to  tend  him.He  returned  to Rome  with  the papal court  in March,  1406;but  he  had  had  enough  of unpleasant  experiences  in thatcity, and  on  the  18th  June  following  he  turned  his  facenorthward  again and  set out on  the road  towards  England.As  it seems,  he  had  received  no  assurance  that  Henrywas  prepared  to  pardon  him;  but  it  is probable  that  hisjourney  to  Bruges,  whither  he  now  directed  his  course,was  specially  undertaken  with  this  object  in view,  and  inXxviINTRODUCTIONany  case  he must  have  felt  that,  if he were  nearer  to  hisown  country,  he would  be  in a better  position  and  wouldhave  better  opportunities  to  sue  for  grace.  He  travelledby way of Siena  and Genoa, and thence through  Piedmont,crossing  the  Mont  Cenis  on  the  29th  June,  and  takingthe  route  through  Savoy,  Burgundy,  and  Champagne,  byway  of  Dijon  and  Troyes,  to  Paris;  thence  throughClermont  to  Amiens,  and  from  thence  through  Arras  toBruges.In  that  city  he  met,  it  may  be  assumed  byappointment,  Richard  del  Brugg,  Lancaster  king  of arms,a  favourite  of  king  Henry  and  in  his  confidence,  who,however,  warned  the  traveller  of  the  king’s  continuedanimosity  and counselled  him  not to venture  into  EnglandThis  he undertook  to  suewithout  a  pardon  first  assured.for,  and  for  it  Adam  waited  expectant  for  two  years,occupying  the  time,  to  some  advantage,  in  legal practicein  Flanders  and  the  north  of  France,  but  not  escapingthe  misfortune  of  being  robbed  by  certain  of  his  owncountrymen.While  at  Bruges,  Adam  came  in  contact  with  thefugitive  earl  of  Northumberland  and  with  Thomas,  lordBardolf,  who  endeavoured  to  persuade  him  to  join  theirfortunes  (pp. 105, 284).  But  he was  cautious  and  refused;he  wisely  “turned  his  cloak’’  and  determined  to  abidethe  king’s  favour.The  defeat  and  death  of  the  earljustified  Adam’s  worldly  wisdom,  and  he  piously  “gavethanks  unto  Him  who  foreseeth  what  is to  come,  for  thatNotwithstanding,  the  report  ofI had  stayed  behind.”his  intercourse  with  the  rebels  came  to  Henry’s  ears  anddrew  down  on  the  unfortunate  exile  a  greater  measure  ofthe  king’s  wrath,  whose  indignation  waxed  stronger  dayby day.  When  therefore  Adam  again  met  the  king  ofarms,  at  Paris,  he  learned  that  his  case  was  apparentlyINTRODUCTIONxxviihopeless.  Thereupon  he  came  to  a  bold  decision,  whichraises  in  the  mind  a  strong  suspicion  that  he  was  notaltogether  innocent  of  some  previous  intriguing  withGlendower.In  his  own  words,  “I,  Adam,  the  writer  ofthis  history,  made  a  declaration  before  the  same  king ofarms  that  I would  feign  myself  Owen’s  man,  and  withmy following  would  cross  over  into Wales  unto  him;  andthence,  taking  my  chance,  I would  steal  away  from  himto  my  lord  of  Powis,  to  await  under  his  care  the  king’sfavour.  And  so  it  came  to  pass.  And  this  declara-tion  saved  me  my  life”  (pp.  117,  295).  Taking  ship  (hedoes  not  say  at what  port),  he was  at  first  unsuccessful  ineluding  the  English  cruisers,  eight  ships of Devon  giving_  chase,  like  hounds  after  a  hare,  and  driving  the  fugitiveto  seek  shelter  in St.  Pol  de  Léon  in Brittany.  A secondattempt  was  successful,  and  Adam  at  length  landed  atBarmouth  in  Merionethshire  (probably  towards  the  endof  the  year  1408)  and  took  to  the  hills  among  Owen’sfollowers,  “sorely  tormented  with  many  and  great  perilsof  death  and  capture  and  false  brethren,  and  of hungerand  thirst,  and  passing  many  nights  without  sleep  forNor  was  it quite  easy  to  slipfear  of the  attacks  of foes.’away  to  his  protector,  lord  Powis.Glendower  wassuspicious  and  bound  him  “under  the  close  restraint  ofpledges,”  which,  however,  Adam  appears  to  have  had  nohesitation  in disregarding.Escaping  by night,  he foundsafety  in  Pontypool,  and  there  he  seems  to  have  passedmore  than  two  years,  “like  a  poor  chaplain  only gettingvictuals  for  saying  mass,  shunned  by thankless  kin  andthose  who  were  once  my  friends,  a  life  sorry  enough—and  how  sorry  God  in His  heart  doth  know.”But,  at last,  Adam’s  troubles  were  over.  By the  inter-cession  of  David  Holbache  (known  to  us  chiefly  as  theXXViliINTRODUCTIONfounder  of Oswestry  Grammar  School),  a  pardon  in  hisfavour  was  issued  on  the 20th March,  1411,  which  confirmshis  own  story  of  his  having  joined  Glendower  as  atemporary  expedient  :—“  Rex  omnibus  ballivis  et fidelibus  suis,  ad  quos,  etc.,  salutem.Sciatis  quod,  cum  Adam  Uske,  clericus,  contra  voluntatem  suamin comitiva  Owini  de  Glyndorduy  et Wallensium  rebellium  exti-terit,  et  ab  eis  tam  cicius  quam  potuit  recesserit,  et  ad  graciamnostram  expectandam  venerit,  Nos, de  gracia  nostra  speciali,  et adsupplicacionem  dilecti  nobis  David  Holbache,  armigeri,  perdo-navimus  eidem  Ade  sectam  pacis  nostre,  que  ad  nos  versus  ipsumpertinet,  pro  omnimodis  prodicionibus  et  adhesionibus  inimiciset  rebellibus  nostris  et  corone  nostre,  ac  pro  omnimodis  feloniiset  transgressionibus  per  ipsum  Adam  ante  hec  tempora  factissive perpetratis,  unde  indictatus,  rettatus,  vel  appellatus  existit,ac  eciam  utlagarias  si  que  in  ipsum  hiis  occasionibus  fuerintpromulgate,  et  firmam  pacem  nostram  ei  inde  concedimus;  Itatamen  quod  stet  recto  in  curia  nostra,  si qui versus  eum  loquiIn  cujus,  etc.voluerint  de  premissis  seu  aliquo  premissorum.PerTeste  rege  apud  Westmonasterium,  xx.  die  Marcii  [1411].ipsum  regem.”  ?In the joy of freedom,  Adam  now  got  him  to  his  owncountry  among  old  friends  and  kinsmen;  but  he  did  notfind  himself  in  all  cases  very  welcome,  especially  withthose,  as  he says,  who  were  his  debtors.  He  had  alreadylearned,  while  he was  abroad,  that  he  had  been  deprivedHis  principal  living,  that  of Castleof all  his  benefices.Combe,  had  been  bestowed,  in 1408, on  Ralph  de Derham,sir  Stephen  Scrope  being  the  patron;  and  it is  probablyto this  deprivation  that  the words  refer, which  are  quotedabove  (p. ix)  from  the  preliminary  notes  accompanyingAdam’s  chronicle:  “Et  quamvis  per  invidiam  cujusdammilitis  fuit  privatus  beneficio.’The  conclusion  of thesentence,  “ecce  quam  solempnis  fuit  ejus  restitucio,”would  then  refer  to  his  restoration  to  his  practice  in  the1  Pat.

He  was  indeed  hoping  for  promo-tion  to  greater  fortune  when  Arundel  suddenly  died,early in 1414,  and Adam’s  expectations  were  disappointed.His  eulogy on  his patron  is accompanied  by the inevitablevision  of the  prelate’s  death,  a well-conceived  fiction  andconstructed  with  some  literary  skill.After  this  there  islittle  to tell  of his  career.On  the  2nd  November,  1414,he  exchanged  with  Roger  Capteyn  the  rectory  of  Mers-tham  for that  of Hopesay  in Shropshire,  in the  diocese  ofHereford?,In  1415  he  was  present  in convocation  andexerted  his  influence  to  relieve  from  taxation  the  bene-fices  of  Wales,  as  being  impoverished  by  war.  Fromthence  we  have  no  further  record  of  him  until  the  year1423,  when  he exchanged  with  David  ap Jevan  ap  Mere-dith  Goch,  on  the  12th  July,  the  living  of  Hopesay  forthat  of  Tregruk  or  Tregreg,  now  Llangibby,  in  Mon-mouthshire,  about  two  miles  south  of Usk,  in  the  dioceseFive  years  later,  on  the  12th  July,  1428,of  Liandaff*.his  estate  in this  benefice  was  ratified  *.But  he was  yet to live  a  little  longer.Adam  must  by this  time  have  been  well  stricken  inyears,  if we  are  right  in our  conjecture  that  he was  bornHisabout  1352.will,  which  has  fortunately  been  preserved‘,  was  datedon  the  20th  January,  1429-30;  and  it  was  proved  onthe  26th  March,  1430.

The  only other  book  namedin  the  will  is  a  copy  of  the  “  Rationale  divinorum  offi-ciorum”  of  Durandus,  bishop  of  Mende,  which  is  leftto  the  church  of  Usk,  the  vicar  also  receiving  a  legacyof 3s.  4d.  To  each  nun  of Usk  priory,  the  establishmentin  whose  interest  we  have  seen  Adam  exerting  himselfat the  papal  court,  and  among  whose  inmates  were  someof  his  kinswomen,  he  leaves  a  remembrance  of  1s.  8d.The  three  confraternities  of  the  friars  minors  and  thefriars  preachers  of Cardiff  and  the  Austin  friars  of New-port  receive  each  a  “trentale,’  or  money  sufficient  toprovide  for  thirty  masses  for  the  good  of  the  soul  ofthe  deceased;  and  to  the  cathedral  church  of  Llandaffthere  is a  legacy  of 3s.4d.  Among  the  individuals  whobenefit  under  the  will,  it  is  interesting  to  find  a  brotherof Adam  (whose name  has been  omitted)  and a sister  Joan.Judging  by the  bequests  of  the  will,  it  seems  that  thetestator  was  not  ill-provided  with  this  world’s  goods.The  total  amount  of  the  money  legacies,  exclusive  ofthat  left  to  the  nuns  of Usk  which  we  have  no  meansof  computing,  is  £28  6s.  8d.In  accordance  with  the  wish  expressed  in  his  will,Adam  was  buried  in Usk  church,  where  there  still  existsa brass,  consisting  of a  long strip  of metal  engraved  withan  inscription  in  two  lines,  which  is  undoubtedly  a  por-tion  of his  epitaph,  in the  Welsh  tongue.This  brass  has  been  for  generations  a  puzzle  to  anti-quaries  and  philologists.In  1773,  a  notice  of  it,  ac-companied  by  a  very  imperfect  facsimile,  appeared  inArchaeologia,  vol.  ij,  in  a  paper  on  the  Julia  Stratacommunicated  to  the  Society  of  Antiquaries  by  theReverend  William  Harris,  who  quotes  an  interpretationby  Dr.  Wotton  which  discovers  in  the  inscription  thexxxiiINTRODUCTIONepitaph  of a  certain  Solomon  the  Astrologer  connectedwith  a  school  of philosophers  well  skilled  in  astronomyand  all  other  sciences  and  established  at  Caerleon  arWysk  before  the  coming  of  the  Saxons.  Knowing  ourAdam  as  well  as  we  do,  this  solution  of  the  riddle  isirresistibly  ludicrous.Gough,  in his  edition  of Camden’sBritannia  (1789),  vol.  ij.  p.  487,  repeats  Archaeologia.In  1801  Coxe,  in  his  Historical  Tour  in  Monmouthshire,p. 418,  gave  a better  facsimile  and  quoted  previous  inter-Next,  the  Cambrianpretations,  also  adding  others.Archaeological  Association  turned  its  attention  to  thebrass  and  printed  further  observations  in  the  Archaeo-logia  Cambriensis,  vol.  ij. (1847)  p.  34;  and  finally,  in1885,  it was  again  before  the  Association  (Arch.  Cambr.,5th  series,  vol.  ij. p. 844), when  Canon  (now Archdeacon)Thomas  claimed  it as  the  epitaph  of our  chronicler.I am  indebted  for my first  knowledge  of this  importantrecord  of Adam  of Usk  to  my  friend,  the  Reverend  OC. H.Middleton-Wake,  who,  when  visiting  Usk  church  notlong after  the  first  publication  of the  chronicle,  observedin the  brass  the  name  of “ Adam  Yske,”  and  rightly  con-jectured  that  it  concerned  our  Adam.Recently  theVenerable  David  Richard  Thomas,  archdeacon  of Mont-gomery,  has  had  the  kindness  to  communicate  with  meon  its  identification.From  what  has  been  stated,  it  is  obvious  that  thereading  and  interpretation  of the  inscription  leave  ampleroom  for  conjecture;  and  the  task  presents  difficultieseven  to  so  learned  and  experienced  a  scholar  as  ProfessorRhfs,  of Oxford,  who  has  kindly  favoured  me  with  thefollowing  observations  and  rendering :—“The  rubbing  from  Adam  of  Usk’s  epitaph  seems  toread  as  follows:INTRODUCTIONXXXill(1)  ’Nole  clode  yrethrode  yar  lleyn  |(2)  aduocade  Nawnhade  llundeyn  |(3)  A barnour  bede  breynt  apilet  |(4)  ynev  a  ro  ty hanabe.(5)  Seliff  sunnoeir  suniase  |(6)  adam  yske  ev  al kuske  |(7)  Deke  kummode  doctor  kymmen  |(8)  len  aloei  lawn  oleue.“T  have  divided  the  two  long  lines  of  the  brass  intofour  short  ones  each,  and  have  numbered  them  accord-The  orthography  isingly  for  the  sake  of  convenience.Franco-English,  more  or  less  consistently,  but  there  arecertain  errors  in  the  spelling  which  must  probably  beascribed  to  the  man  who  engraved  the  epitaph.Hewould  seem  to  have  had  it  written  out  for  him  in  thesort  of handwriting  with  which  one  is  familiar  in  theRed  Book  of  Hergest.  The  first  slip  occurs  in  the  firstline:  the  first  r  should  be  v.  Then  I come  to  line  8,where  I  cannot  help  thinking  apilet  should  be  apeleit.I  must  confess,  however,  that  even  then  the  line  doesnot  seem  at  all  satisfactory.In  line  4 the  last  word  waspossibly  written  haneve  and  intended  to  rhyme  witholeue  at the  end  of  line  8.  But  the  engraver  apparentlymisread  the  v  into  b, which  was  a  very  natural  error  tomake  in  that  hand,  while  his  substitution  of a  for  e wasdue  to carelessness.In  line  6 for  /k read  w:  a  glance  atthe  w’s  in  any  English  or  Welsh  MS.  of  the  period  willexplain  at  once  how  easy  it was  to  commit  this  mistake.In  line  8 the  metre  requires  loei  to  be a  dissyllable;  andI think  the  spelling  should  have  been  lowe  or  loie,  for  Iam  inclined  to  regard  it  as  lowe,  to  be  equated  with  thebook  Welsh  form  oleuei,  ‘would  light’  or  ‘was  wont  tolight’;  but  it  is not  to be concealed  that  there  are  otherpossibilities.“  After  these  remarks  by way  of preface,  I would,  withthe  utmost  diffidence,  transcribe  the  epitaph  into  modernWelsh  and translate  it into  English  as  follows  :—CcXXXIVINTRODUCTION‘Nol  clod  i feddrod  i ar  MainFrom  fame  to  a  grave  above,the  strip  (comes)Adfocad  llawnhad  Llundain.An  advocate,  the  fullness  ofA  barnwr  byd  braint  apél  itThe  world’s  Judge,  by right  ofY nef  a  ro,  ty anau  (?)Grant  heaven,  the  house  ofappeal,  to theeLondon.songs  (?)Selyf synnwyr  syniasaiThe  wisdom  by  Solomon  cogi-tated—Adam  Ysk  ef a  wiscaiWith  it Adam  of  Usk  was  in-vested ;Dug  gymod,  doctor  cymenWith  him  he  brought  concord,Llen  a  ’leuai  llawn  olau.’A torch  full  bright  he  lit  inthe  world  of letters.’discreet  doctor,“TI  do  not  know  what  to make  of  lleyn,  except  to  treatit as  llain,  ‘a strip,’  say  here  of coloured  tiles  in the  floor,and  if so  it  would  seem  that  the  author  of  the  epitaphwished  to specify  where  Adam’s  grave  was  situated.“Why the  epigrapher  wrote  his  Welsh  in a non-Welshorthography  is  not  very  evident;  probably  he  was  notfamiliar  with  Welsh  spelling.But  neither  was  he  quiteconsistent  with  himself:  witness,  for  instance,  the  asson-ance  disguised  by  using  y  and  uw  in  Yske  and  wuske.Speaking  more  generally,  he had  not  mastered  the literarylanguage,  and  he  certainly  did  not  understand  the  cyng-Nevertheless,  hehanedd  or  consonance  of a Welsh  englyn.has  left  us  the  oldest  epitaph  I have  heard  of, as  writtenin Welsh;  and,  so  far  as  it goes,  nothing  could  surpass  itin  interest  as  a  specimen  of  the  pronunciation  of  theGwentian  dialect  of the  language  in the  Middle  Ages.” }1  Professor  Rhfs adds  the  following  note:  “Since  the  above  was  setup  in type  I have  had  an  opportunity  of  submitting  it  to  a  friend,who  has  improved  on  it  at  more  points  than  one.In  later  spellinghis  version  would  read  as  follows  :—’Nol  clod  ddu  ethrod  ddarlleinAdvocad  Jlawnhad  LlundeinA barnwr  byd breint  a  pilerY ner  a  vo  yth arwein.INTRODUCTIONXXXVHere,  then, we  bid  farewell  to our  garrulous  old  friend,whose  complacent  vanity,  we  feel  certain,  would  havebeen  mightily  soothed  and  flattered,  could  he  but  haveforeseen  that  his  epitaph  (particularly  if,  as  is  not  un-likely,  he composed  it himself)  would  in  after  ages  havebeen  the  subject  of so  much  learned  discussion.As  a  contribution  to history,  Adam  of Usk’s  chronicleis too  brief and  too  disconnected  to take  a  very  importantposition.  Its  chief value  consists  in its  personal  interest ;and  it  has  an  advantage  over  the  ordinary  mediaevalchronicle  in being the work  of an  independent  individual,and  not  that of  a  monastic  compiler  who  had  to  adoptand  reflect  the  politics  of his  house.  Adam  of Usk  movedin  the  world;  he  was  a  priest  and  a  lawyer,  he  pleadedin the  courts,  he spoke  in  convocation,  and  he  came  intopersonal  contact  with  some  of  the  most  important  menof his  day;  and  happily  he  had  vanity  enough  to  thinkhis  personal  experiences  not  unworthy  of taking  a  placeamong  the  general  events  of his  time.The  chronicle  commences  with  a  series  of  imperfectnotes  of some  of the  principal  events  of  Richard’s  reignprevious  to  1394—jottings  from  memory,  which  Adamhimself  warns  us  are  not  to  be  regarded  as  continuoushistorical  narrative.  His  apology  for  the  scanty  characterof his  early  pages  might  also  be  applied  to  other  partsof his  work,  which  is in fact  a  roughly-cast  compilation,Deg kymmod  doctor  kymmenLlen  a  léei  llawn  oleuei.Selyf synnwyr  syniaseiAdam  Ysk  ef ae  dyscei‘Thus  it will  be  seen  he  regards  the  errors  in the  epitaph  as  morenumerous  than  I had  assumed.He  also  mends  the  metre,  and  byreading  two  of  the  y’s as  th  (=Welsh  dd) he  gets  rid  of the  awkwardyar  lleyn  which  becomes  ddarlleyn,  ‘reading.’But  even  then  weare  left  with  difficulties  of  which  neither  of  us  has  been  able  todispose.”XXXVIINTRODUCTIONbut  not  composed  all  at  once,  some  of the  events  havingbeen  recorded  at  the  time  of  their  occurrence,  while  thedescriptions  of  others  have  evidently  been  written  atlater  times  when  the  recollection  of them  was  no  longerfresh  in  the  writer’s  mind.Hence  the  chronologicalsequence  is  in  places  at  fault;  and  at  the  end  of  theHad  Adamchronicle  there  are  careless  repetitions.revised  his  work,  these  imperfections  would  no  doubthave  disappeared;  but  he  left  others  to  publish  “thisrecord  of  his  foolishness,’  and  his  literary  executorappears  to  have  thought  it  enough  to  transcribe  thematerial  as  it stood..There  are  three  several  subjects  of  interest  which,before  all  others,  form  the  most  prominent  features  inAdam’s  work:  the  fall  and  deposition  of  Richard;  theoccurrences  at  Rome  during  the  period  of  the  writer’sresidence  there;  and  the  rebellion  of  Owen  Glendowerand  contemporary  affairs  in Wales.The  detailed  account  of  Richard’s  last  parliament  in1397,  with  which  the  continuous  historical  narrativepractically  leads  off,  is  borrowed  from  the  chronicle  ofthe  Monk  of  Evesham;  but  this  appropriation,  it  is fairto  suggest,  need  not  be  regarded  so  much  as  a  theft  asa  testimony  to  the  accuracy  of that  history, Adam  himselfhaving  been  present  during  the  proceedings.It  is  alsoAdam’s  personal  share  in  the  subsequent  events  whichculminated  in  Richard’s  deposition  that  renders  hisaccount  of  things  at  this  time  so  valuable  as  well  asinteresting.|His  compulsory  sojourn  at  Rome  happened  at  animportant  period  of  papal  history—the  period  of  thedeath  of  Boniface  the  ninth,  and  of  the  succession  ofInnocent  the  seventh  and  his  quarrel  with  the  RomansINTRODUCTIONXXXViiand  his flight from  the  city and  subsequent  return.  Theseevents  afford  our  chronicler  an  opportunity  for describingvarious  public  ceremonies,  which  naturally  had  an  attrac-tion  for  him  as  a  stranger,  and  of which  he  gives  somecurious  details.But,  as  a  Welshman,  Adam  takes  special  notice  ofevents  in  his  native  country,  and  his  account  of  theprogress  of Glendower’s  rebellion  contains  many  detailsof value.  Although  he  speaks  of the  national  hero  andhis  following  with  some  contempt,  at  the  same  time  heevinces  a  natural  sympathy  with  the  sufferings  of  hiscountrymen  at  the  hands  of the  invading  English;  and,as  already  observed,  the  fact  of his  taking  refuge  withGlendower,  while  in  disgrace  with  Henry,  after  hisreturn  from  Rome,  suggests  an  earlier  understandingbetween  them.Perhaps  it  was  to  some  connection  ofthis  nature  that  Adam  owed  his  knowledge  of  Owen’sletters  of  appeal  to  the  king  of  Scotland  and  the  Irishchieftains,  which  he  incorporates  in his  chronicle.Other  documents  of interest  of which  Adam  gives  thetext  are:  sir  Thomas  Dymock’s  petition  for  the  cham-pionship  at the  coronation  of Henry the  fourth ; the  casesubmitted  for Adam  of Usk’s  opinion  on  the  question  ofthe  restoration  of queen  Isabella’s  dower;  and  the  letterof  remonstrance  addressed  to  Henry  the  fourth  by  hisconfessor  Philip  Repyngdon,  the  abbot  of Leicester.Lastly,  a  passing  reference  may  be  made  to  thechronicle  of  the  defeat  of  the  French  by  the  Flemingsat  the  battle  of  Courtrai,  drawn  up  in  the  form  ofa  parody  of  the  Gospel  narrative  of  the  Passion  of  ourLord,  and  transcribed  from  a  MS.  at  Bruges.  That  Adamshould  have  incorporated  it  in  his  chronicle  withoutcomment  and  apparently  with  indifference  to  its  offensiveXXXVili INTRODUCTIONcharacter  is an  instance  of the  seeming  lack  of  reverence,according  to  modern  ideas,  for  things  sacred  which  issometimes  observable  in  the  middle  ages,  when  theemployment  of  Bible  history  as  the  vehicle  for  themiracle-play  and  the  passion-play  naturally  exposed  itto the  danger  of vulgarly  familiar  treatment.E.

Andthis  he  commanded  and  made  to  be  openly  proclaimedthroughout  the  counties  of  the  kingdom.  And  then  whata  throe  of  grief  passed  through  the  desolated  land!

And  the  followers  of this  master  John,like  Mahomet,  by preaching  things  pleasing  to the  powerfuland  the  rich,  namely,  that  the  withholding  of  tithes  andeven  of  offerings  and  the  reaving  of  temporal  goods  fromthe  clergy  were  praiseworthy,  and,  to  the  young,  thatself-indulgence  was  a  virtue,  most  wickedly  did  sow  theseed  of murder,  snares,  strife,  variance,  and  discords,  whichlast  unto  this  day,  and  which,  I fear,  will  last  even  to  theundoing  of  the  kingdom.  Whence,  in  many  parts  of  theland,  and  above  all  in  London  and  in  Bristol,  they,  likethe  Jews  at  Mount  Horeb  on  account  of  the  molten  calf(Exodus  xxxij.),  turning  against  each  other,  righteouslyhad to grieve  for three-and-twenty  thousand  of their  fellowswho  suffered  a  miserable  fate’.The  people  of  England,wrangling  about  the  old  faith  and  the  new,  are  every  day,as  it were,  on  the  very  point  of  bringing  down  upon  theirown  heads  rebellion  and  ruin.

ThomasArundel,  bishop  of  Ely,  had  replaced  Michael  de  la  Pole,  earl  ofSuffolk,  as chancellor;  John  Gilbert,  bishop of Hereford,  was  treasurer  ;and  John  de Waltham,  keeper  of the  privy  seal.It  will  be  remem-bered  that  John  of  Gaunt  was  at  this  time  in  Spain,  as  a  reason  forhis  name  not  appearing  on  the  commission.A.D,  1387,ADAM  OF  USK143The  king,  bearing  it ill that  by this  appointment  the  duefreedom  of his  majesty  should  be bridled  by his  own  lieges,and  urged  by his  servants  who  were  angered  that  their  evilgains  were  thereby  prevented,  ceased  not  to  thwart  thosewho  were  thus  set  in  authority,  till  the  end  came  in  thedestruction  of  the  king  himself,  his  abettors,  and  many  ofthese  same  rulers,  And  from  thence  alas!  what  griefsand  weary  deeds  followed,  and  specially  concerning  thedeath  of  those  nobles,  the  duke  of  Gloucester  and  the  earlof Arundel,  it will  appear  more  fully hereafter.  To proceed  :those  who  thus  urged  on  the  king,  in order  to the  suddensuppression  of  the  twelve  rulers,  planned  that  a  generalcouncil  should  be holden  in the  Tower  of London,  whereinthey thought  suddenly  and  at  one  blow,  by  means  of  anambush  of  armed  men,  to  destroy  the  twelve  whensummoned  to, the  council.But  the  Almighty  disposedthe  twelve,  being  forewarned  of  that  wicked  design,  tocome  in  such  strength  that  the  king  and  his  abettors,disordered  by  their  warlike  preparation,  feared  that  thekingdom  would  rise  in  their  favour.Wherefore  a  peacewas  made,  though  a  hollow  one.Hearing  this,  our  ladythe  princess,  the  mother  of  the  king,  with  heavy  grief  inher  heart,  and  not sparing  to toil  on  even  by night, hastenedfrom  Wallingford  to  London,  to  allay  the  discord.  Andon  her  knees  she  prayed  the  king,  her  son,  as  he  looked  forher  blessing,  in no  wise  to  bend  to the  wishes  of flatterers,and  specially  of those  who  were  now  urging  him  on;  other-wise  he  would  bring  down  her  curse  upon  him.  But  theking  with  reverence  raised  her  up  and  promised  that  hewould  willingly  be  guided  by the  counsel  of  the  twelve.To  whom  his  mother  replied:  “  At  thy coronation,  my  son,I rejoiced  that  it  had  fallen  to  my  lot  to  be the  mother  ofan  anointed  king;  but  now I grieve,  for  I foresee  the  fallwhich  threatens  thee,  the  work  of  accursed  flatterers.”Then  the  king passed with  his mother  to  Westminster  Hall,and  there,  seated  on  his  throne  of  state,  by her  mediation,144,THE  CHRONICLE  OFA.D.  1387,made  his  peace  with  the  twelve  guardians;  yet  did  he  itfalsely  and  with  deceit  1.|Soon  afterwards,  the  earl  of  Oxford?  went  with  royalletters  into  the  county  of  Chester,  and  led  back  with  hima  great  armed  power  of  the  men  of  those  parts,  for  theBut  the  duke  of Gloucester  anddestruction  of the  twelve.1  Adam  has  here  mixed  up  several  events  in  confusion.  He  tells  usfurther  on  that  we  must  not  read  this  earlier  part  of his  chronicle  asconsecutive  history;  and  the  hint  is  wanted  nowhere  more  than  inthis  his  account  of  Richard’s  attempt  to  cast  off  the  thraldom  inwhich  the  Wonderful  Parliament  had  placed  him.  The  stories  ofplots laid  by Richard  for  the  destruction  of  his  enemies  are  so  many,and  told  in so  many  different  ways  in  the  chronieles,  that  some  con-fusion  in the  mind  of the  writer  may be pardoned.  Knighton  (ij. 216)first  reports  the  rumour  that  the  king,  who  had  retired  to Eltham  onthe  meeting  of  the  parliament,  in  1386,  designed  to  assassinatea  deputation  of  forty  of the  members  whom  he  had  summoned  toappear  before  him.  Walsingham  (ij. 150)  records  a  plot to invite  theduke  of Gloucester  and  the  parliamentary  opponents  of  the  earl  ofSuffolk  to  a  banquet  in  the  city,  and  there  slay them.  The  Monkof  Evesham  (75)  repeats  this  story,  adding,  ‘Michael  statuit  (nedicam,  hoc  esse  regis  commentum).”  The  commons  themselves,  intheir  petition  against  the  duke  of Ireland’s  party,  refer  to  some  suchdesign,  saying  that  the  traitors  “‘firent  que  nostre  seigneur  le  Roicommanda  a  Meire  de Loundre  de  faire  sudeinement  lever  un  grauntpoare  de  gentz  de  Loundre,  d’occire  et  mettre  au  mort  touz  les  ditzseigneurs  et  communs  horpris  ceux  qui  furrunt  de  lour  coveine”(Rot.  Parl.  iij.  231,  art.  15).  Again,  in  1387,  after  the  council  ofNottingham,  when  the  revolted  lords  were  invited  by  Richard  toa  conference  at Westminster,  they  advanced  with  extreme  cautionon  the  report  of  an  ambush  in  the  Mews  (Wals.  ij.  165;  Mon.Evesh.  91;  Knighton,  ij. 248).  Unfortunately  for  the  story  of  theintervention  of  the  princess  of Wales,  that  lady had  already  died  in1385.  However,  the  fact  remains  that,  not  long before  her  death,  shedid  undertake  a  fatiguing  journey  to reconcile  Richard  with  his  uncle,the  duke  of  Lancaster;  though  the  words  which  are  placed  in  hermouth  by our  chronicler  are  not  recorded  elsewhere  (Wals.  ij. 126;Mon.

On  the  morrow  of  the  Purification  of  Our1  Alexander  Nevill,  archbishop  of York,  on  his  attainder,  was  trans-lated  by pope  Urban  to  the  see  of  St.  Andrew’s.This  dignity  was,however,  worth  no  more  than  a bishopric  in  partibus,  as  Scotlandfollowed  Clement  VII.  The  archbishop  showed  his wisdom  by retiringto  a  small  cure  at Louvain,  where  he died  in  1392.Suffolk  went  first  to  Holland,  but  was  afterwards  invited  to  Paris,where  he  died  in  13889.

Never  hadI thought  concerning  our  lord  the  king,  save  what  was  tohis  welfare  and  honour.”Then  said  the  king  to  him:“  Didst  thou  not  say  to  me,  at  the  time  of thy parliament,in the  bath  behind  the  White  Hall,  that  sir  Simon  Burley,  |my  knight,  was,  for  many  reasons,  worthy  of death?  AndI answered  thee  that  I knew  no  cause  of  death  in  him.And  then  thou  and  thy fellows  did  traitorously  slay him.”And  then  the  duke  of  Lancaster  passed  sentence  of  deathupon  him  in  these  words:  “Richard,  I,  seneschal  ofEngland,  do  adjudge  thee  traitor,  and  I  do  by sentenceand judgement  condemn  thee to be drawn, hanged, beheaded,and  quartered,  and  thy lands,  entailed  and  unentailed,  tobe forfeit.”Then  the  king,  having  regard  for  his  noble  birth,  com-manded  him  to  be  beheaded  only.  And  there  led  himA.D.  1397,p.  15.ADAM  OF  USK159away  his foes, the earl  of Kent, his  own  nephew,  and  otherswho  coveted  his  lands,—and  who  were  afterwards  cut  off,as  will  appear,  by an  evil  death,—to  the  Tower  Hill;  andthere  did  they behead  him?.  And  with  his  soul  may  I befound  worthy  to  rest  in  bliss!,  for,  assuredly,  I doubt  notthat  he  is gathered  to  the  company  of  the  saints.  As  tohis  body,  though  it was  then  without  honour  laid  in  thechurch  of the  Austin  friars  of London,  yet  now  is it mostgloriously  worshipped  with  deep  reverence  and  withabounding  offerings  of the people.On  the  Saturday  (22nd  September),  sir Thomas  Mortimerwas  vouched,  under  pain  of  banishment  as  a  traitor,  toappear  within  six  months,  to  stand  his  trial,  And  theking  said;  “Perchance  the  earl  of  March  will  not  be ableto  take  him;  I will  therefore  wait  until  his  capture  becertified.’The  which  sir  Thomas,  thus  banished,  stayedthe  time  of his  banishment  in Scotland *.It was  also declared  that  all benefices  granted  and  trans-ferred  by such  persons  as  had been, or  should  be, condemnedin  this  parliament,  and  all  other  grants  whatsoever  madeby them  since  the  tenth  year  of the  king,  be recalled.1  Richard  Fitzalan,  earl  of Arundel,  was  uncle  to the  young  earl  ofKent,  his  sister  Alice  having  married  Thomas  Holland,  second  earlof  Kent,  lately  deceased.The  earl  of  Huntingdon  is  also  saidto  have  been  present  at  the  execution,  and  with  him  the  earl  ofNottingham,  earl-marshal,  the  son-in-law  of Arundel,  though  it seemsthat  at this  time  he was  at Calais  (see  Walsingham,  ij. 225;  Wallon,Richard  IE.  ij. 456).  However,  the  common  belief  that  Nottinghamwas  there  appears  in  some  lines  of Richard  the  Redeles  (pass.  III.  105,106),  a  poem  written  by William  Langland  in  the  year  1399  (ed.W.  W.  Skeat,  Early  Engl.  Text  Soc.,  1873),  wherein  the  story  told  byFroissart  (IV.  c.  92),  that  the  earl-marshal  actually  bandaged  hisfather-in-law's  eyes,  seems  to  be  alluded  to.  Arundel  was  deservedlya  favourite  with  the  people.  He  was  one  of  the  best  sea-captains  ofthe  day,  as  he proved  by his  victories  in 1387  and  1388.2  It will  be  seen,  on  p. 165,  that  sir Thomas  Mortimer  is called  theuncle  of the  earl  of  March,If he was  so,  it  must  have  been  by anillegitimate  connection,  as  he  is  not  recognized  in the  genealogy  ofthe  family.;A.D.  1397.p.  16.160THE  CHRONICLE  OFOn  the  Monday  next  following  (24th  September),  wasread  the  declaration  of the earl  of Nottingham,  then  captainof Calais, in whose  keeping  had  been  the duke of Gloucester,that  the  same  duke  could  not  appear  on  his  trial,  for  thathe  had  died  in  his  keeping;  and  at  the  prayer  of  the  saidappellants  the  same  judgement  was  issued  against  him,  asagainst  the  earl  of Arundel.Thomas,  archbishop  of  Canterbury,  also,  after  that  histemporalities  had  been  seized,  was  banished  the  kingdom.On  the  Tuesday  following  (25th  September),  Rickhill  ',one  of  the judges  of  our  lord  the  king,  a  native  of  Ireland,read  divers  confessions  drawn  up  in writings  touching  thesaid  treasons,  declaring  them  to  be  the  confessions  of  thesaid  duke  of Gloucester,  put forth  by him  and  written  withhis  own  hand.Also,  the  county  of  Chester  was  raised  to  the  honour  ofa duchy,  and  was  augmented  by the addition  of the  forfeitedlands  of  the  earl  of  Arundel.  And  the  earl  of  Salisburyprayed  for  a  writ  of  scire  facias  to  be  granted  to  himagainst  the  earl  of March  touching  the  lordship  of Denbighin  Wales;  and  the  king  answered  thereon  that  he wouldconsider  it *.Also, on  the Wednesday  next  following  (26th  September),it was  decreed  that  the  lands  of  the  said  earl  of  Arundel,which  were  added  to  the  said  duchy  of  Chester,  shouldenjoy  its  liberties  in  all  things,  saving  that  the  Welshinhabitants  of  those  lands  should  still  hold  their  ancientrights  and  customs.It was  likewise  ordained  that  all who  gave  counsel,  help,or  favour  to  the  children  of those  who  had  been,  or  shouldbe, condemned  in this  parliament,  should  be punished  with?

And  the  parliament  was  adjournedto  the  next  Friday.A.D,  1897.On  that  day  (28th  September),  the  king  declared  whatissue  of  the  condemned  should  be  debarred  from  theirestates,  and  from  the  councils  and  parliaments  of the  king:to  wit,  heirs  male,  and  all  deseending  from  them  in  themale  line  for  ever.Also,  the  king  appointed  to  the  said  archbishop  ofCanterbury  a  term  of  six  weeks  to  withdraw  from  thekingdom.Also,  it  was  ordained  that  all  the  lords,  spiritual  andtemporal,  should  swear  to observe  unswervingly  whatsoeverhad  been  or  should  be done,  decreed,  or  despatched  in thisparliament;  the  prelates  also  hurling  their  censures  fromthis  time  forth  upon  such  as  should  make  opposition.Also,  the  earl  of  Warwick  was  brought  to trial;  and  hishood  was  taken  from  him,  and  the  appeal  was  read.  Andlike  a  wretched  old  woman  he  made  confession  of  allcontained  therein,  wailing  and  weeping  and  whining  that hehad  done  all, traitor  that  he  was  ; submitting  himself  in allthings  to the  king’s  grace,  and  bewailing  that  he  had  everbeen  ally  of  the  appellees.  And  the  king  asked  him  bywhom  he  had  been  lured  to  them;  and  he  answered,  bythe  duke  of Gloucester  and  by the  then  abbot  of St. Albansand  by  a  monk  recluse  of  Westminster;  and  he  keptbegging  the  king’s  grace.  And  then,  all  as  it were  lament-ing  and  seeking  the  royal  favour  for  him,  the  king  gavehim  his  life  to  pine away  in  perpetual  prison  without  thekingdom,  his  goods,  moveable  and  immoveable—as  in  thecase  of  the  earl  of Arundel—being  first  seized.  And  thenthe  king  sent  him  to  the  Tower  of  London,  and  at  lengthordered  him  to  be  taken  to  the  castle  of the  Isle  of Man,to  be  held  in  the  keeping  of William  Scrope,  lord  of thatisland,  a  prisoner  for  life.Also,  on  the  Saturday  (29th  September),  the  king allowedto  the  earl  of Warwick  one  month  to  betake  himself  to  theMp.  17.A.D.  1897,162THE  CHRONICLE  OFsaid  castle  of Man.

Duringits  session,  the  duke  of  Norfolk,  who  afterwards  died  inexile  at  Venice,  laid  snares  of  death  against  the  duke  ofLancaster  as  he  came  thither;  which  thing  raised  heavystorms  of  trouble.But  the  duke,  forewarned  by others,escaped  the  snare’.The  king  meanwhile,  ever  hastening  to  his  fall,  amongother  burdens  that  he  heaped  upon  his  kingdom,  kept  inhis  following  four  hundred  unruly  men  of  the  county  ofChester,  very  evil;  and  in  all  places  they  oppressed  hisThesesubjects  unpunished,  and  beat  and  robbed  them.men,  whithersoever  the  king went,  night  and  day, as  if atwar,  kept  watch  in  arms  around  him;  everywhere  com-mitting  adulteries,  murders,  and  other  evils  without  end.1  “For  you,  my  noble  lord  of  Lancaster,The  honourable  father  to  my  foe,Once  did  I lay  an  ambush  for  your  life,A  trespass  that  doth  vex  my  grieved  soul;But,  ere  I last  received  the  Sacrament,I did  confess  it,  and  exactly  begg’dYour  grace’s  pardon,  and  I hope  I had  it.”Rich.  IT., act  I. sc.  i.Such  are  the  words  which  Shakespeare  puts  into  Mowbray’s  mouth,closely  following  the  account  given  by Holinshed.  From what  sourcethe  latter  took  the  story  of the  ambush  does  not  appear.That  sucha  plot  against  the  life  of  Lancaster  had  a  real  existence  is  notunlikely,  considering  the  jealousy  with  which  he  had  been  regardedin his  days  of power;  but  that  Norfolk  had  designs  upon  him  so  lateas  the  parliament  of Shrewsbury  can  hardly  be  true.  He  is  said  tohave  refused  to  attend  the  parliament  in  1384,  fearing  a  plot  againsthim  (Mon.  Evesh.  57).A.D,  1898.170THE  CHRONICLE  OFAnd  to  such  a  pass  did  the  king  cherish  them  that  hewould  not  deign  to  listen  to  any  one  who  had  complaintagainst  them;  nay,  rather  he  would  disdain  him  as  anenemy.  And  this  was  a  chief  cause  of his  ruin?.In the  same  parliament,  the  duke  of Hereford,  son  of  thesaid  duke  of  Lancaster,  appealed  the  duke  of  Norfolk  oftreason.  Wherefore  the  king appointed  to them  the morrowof the Exaltation  of the Holy Cross?  next  following  to fightThe  duke  of  Hereford  meanwhile,  findingin that  quarrel.But  the  duke  of Norfolkpledges,  went  whither  he would.2  The  excesses  of  Richard’s  Cheshire  guards  are  a  common  topicwith  the  chroniclers.The  archers  who  surrounded  the  parliament-house  in  1897,  as  above  noticed,  were  men  of Chester,  who  had  beenspecially  summoned  by Richard  to  form  his body-guard  (Walsingham,ij. 224).  In the  Annales  Ricardi  IT., they  appear  as  “natura  bestiales,qui parati  erant  ad  omnem  nequitiam  perpetrandam;  ita  ut  exposttanta  surrexit  eis  insolentia,  ut regem  reputabant  in socium,  et  alios,quanquam  valentes  et dominos,  haberent  in  despectum.Et  hii  nonerant  de  generosis  patriew,  sed  tracti  vel  de  rure,  vel  sutoria  velalia  quavis  arte;  ut  qui  domi  vix  digni  reputati  fuerant  detraherecalceos  magistrorum,  hic  se  reputabant  pares  et  socios  dominorum.”Interference  of these  favoured  subjects  of  Richard  in  other  mattersbesides  soldiering  is  noticed  in  Richard  the  Redeles,  iij. 317,  whereinthe  remarks  in  the  text  above  on  the  king’s  protection  of them  arerepeated  in very  similar  words  :—“For  chyders  of  Chester  were  chose  many  daiesTo  ben  of  conceill  ffor  causis  pat  in  pe  court  hangid,And  pledid  pipoudris  alle  manere  pleyntis.They  constrewed  quarellis  to  quenche  pe peple,And  pletid  with  pollaxis  and  poyntis  of  swerdis,And  at  the  dome-jevynge  drowe  out  pe bladis,And  lente  men  levere  of  her  longe  battis.They  lacked  alle  vertues  pat  a  juge  shulde  have ;For,  er  a  tale  were  ytolde,  pey wolde  trie  pe harmes,Without  ony  answere  but  ho  his  lyf hatid.And  ho  so  pleyned  to  pe prince,  pat  pees  shulde  kepe,Of  these  mystirmen,  medlers  of wrongis,He  was  lyghtliche  ylau3te  and  yluggyd  of  many,And  ymummyd  on  pe mouthe  and  manaced  to  pe deth.”2  This  day  would  fall  on  the  15th  September;  the  16th  was  theactual  day  appointed.ADAM  OF  USK171being  delivered  into  custody  at  Windsor,  his  offices  weregiven  over  to  his  other  co-appellors,  that  is, the  office  ofmarshal  of  England  to  the  duke  of  Surrey,  and  that  ofcaptain  of  Calais  to  the  duke  of  Exeter;  on  accountof which  grants,  by His  righteous  judgement,  God  did  sendbetween  him  and  them  great  confusion  of  strife,  accordingto  what  the  prophecy  says  in the  verse  :—A.D.  1398.p.  24.“By  the  Judge  of  Heaven’s  decreeThe  wicked  throng  shall  bursten  be.”!And  on  the  day of  battle  they  both  came  in  great  stateto the  appointed  place,  which  was  fenced  with  a  wet  ditch.But  the  duke  of  Hereford  appeared  far  more  gloriouslydistinguished  with  diverse  equipments  of  seven  horses”.And,  because  the  king  had  it  by divination  that  the  dukeof  Norfolk  should  then  prevail,  he  rejoiced  much,  eagerlystriving  after  the  destruction  of the  duke  of Hereford.  Butwhen  they joined  battle,  it  seemed  to  him  that  the  dukeof  Hereford  would  prevail.  And  so  the  king  ordered  thecombat  to  be stayed,  laying  perpetual  exile  on  the  duke  ofNorfolk,  yet  being  minded,  when  he  should  find  occasion,to  restore  him.But  the  duke  of  Hereford  he banished  theThe  one  died  at  Venice  in exile;  therealm  for  ten  years,other  within  a  year  came  back  in  triumph  to the  kingdom,and,  deposing  him  who  had  banished  him,  reigned  thereinwith  might.In  this  year,  the  morrow  of  Saint  Blaise  (4th  February),died  the  duke  of Lancaster,  and  in the  church  of Saint  Paulin London,  nigh  to  the  high  altar,  was  with  great  honoursburied.A.D.  1399,In the  parliament  of Shrewsbury,  the  king got the  wholepower  of  the  government  to  be  given  over  to  him  and  toA.D.  1398.1  Bridlington,  dist.  ij. cap.  vj.The  combatants  made  a  great  display  of  arms  and  trappings.Henry  was  assisted  by armourers  sent by the duke  of Milan ; Mowbrayreceived  his  arms  from  Germany.—Froissart,  iv.  63;  <Archwologia,xx.  102.A.D.  1898.A.D.  1399.172THE  CHRONICLE  OFsix  others  to  be  named  by  him  for  the  term  of  his  life,where  and  when  he  should  please!.

And  at length,  in an  evil  hour, he set  out  for  Ireland(29th  May)  to subdue  it, for, as  will  hereinafter  be seen,  hisreturn  to  his  own  land  was  to his  injury.The  coming  out  of  exile  of the  said  duke  of  Hereford,now  by his  father’s  death  become  duke  of Laneaster,  and  sotwice  a  duke,  was  according  to  the  word  of the  prophecy  ofBridlington  where  are  the  verses  :—“  With  scarce  three  hundred  men  the  duke  shall  comeagain ;p.  25.And  Philip,  false,  shall  flee,  all  reckless  of  the  slain.”  2This  duke  Henry,  according  to  the  prophecy  of  Merlin,But,  followingwas  the  eaglet,  as  being  the  son  of  John*,?

The  “pullusaquilz”  is  however  not  to  be  found  in  the  prophecy  of  Merlin,  asgiven  in  Geoffrey  of  Monmouth,  but  in  the  “  Prophetia  Aquile,”which  often  accompanies  it in  the  MSS.  The  following  is  found  inMS.  Reg.  15  C.  xvj.  f. 184:—“  Post  hee  dicetur  per  Britanniam  rexest  rex  non  est.  Post  hec  eriget  caput  suum  et regem  se  esse  signifi-cabit  multis  fracturis  sed  nulla  reparacione.Post  hee  erit  tempusmilvorum  et quod  quisque  rapuerit  pro  suo  habebit,  et hoc  septennisvigebit.

IV.).1  Adam  no  doubt  refers  to the line in Bridlington  (dist. ij. cap.  vij.)—“Cum  canis  intrabit,  leo  cum  tauro  volitabit,”which  is thus  commented  upon:  “  Cum  canis  intrabit,  id est,  cum  illastella  nociva  in  ccelo,  que  canis  primus  dicitur,  oriatur  cum  sole,quod  est  quando  sol  est  in fine  cancri  in mense  Julii  in diebus  canicu-laribus,”  ete.  The  adaptation  of  prophecy  could  scarcely  be  carriedfurther  than  to  dub  a man  “  dog”  because  he works  out  his  mission  inthe  dog-days.2  The  greyhound  has  not  been  commonly  recognized  as  amongHenry’s  badges.  The  better  known  ones  were  the  antelope,  the whiteswan,  and  the  fox’s brush.Here,  however,  is the  badge  of  the  grey-hound,  so  specifically  named  that  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  Henrymade  use  of it.  Richard’s  cognizance  of the  white  hart  may  perhapshave  suggested  his  rival’s  use  of the  greyhound  at this  time,  with  thesignificance  pointed  to in the  text.  In the  Harleian  MS.  1989, f.381,containing  a  chronicle  (unfortunately  very  corrupt)  compiled  atChester,  is also  to be found a reference  to this badge :—‘‘ Unde  crediturquod  armigeri  ducis  Lancastrie  deferentes  collistrigia  quasi  leporariiad destruendum  insolenciam  misse  bestie,”  etc.  (Traison  et  Mort  deRichart  IT., 283.)The  identification  of the greyhound  as  a badge of Henry Bolingbrokemay  explain  a  passage  in  Richard  the  Redeles  (ij.  113),  which  hascaused  some  trouble  to editors  :—“But  had  pe good  greehonde  be  not  agreved,But  cherischid  as  a  cheffeteyne  and  cheff  of 3oure  lese,3e hadde  had  hertis  ynowe  at  3oure  wille  to  go  and  to  ride.”Mr.  Wright  supposes  John  Beaufort,  earl  of Dorset,  to  be here  meant,the  greyhound  being  the  cognizance  of his  family  (Political  Poems,Professor  Skeat  proposes  Ralph  Nevill,  earl  ofRolls  series,  i. 386).Westmoreland.There  can,  however,  be  no  question  that  Henry  ismore  likely  to be pointed  to  as  “chief  of your  leash,”  than  the  othertwo  comparatively  unimportant  nobles.With  reference  to these  types  and badges,  it is a curious  coincidencethat  in the  will  of Edmund  Mortimer,  third  earl  of March,  quoted  byDugdale  (Baronage,  i.  149),  a  saltcellar  in  the  form  of  a  dog  isbequeathed  to  his  daughter;  and  to  Henry,  lord  Percy,  a  little  cup,made  like  the  body  of a hart,  with  the  head  of an  eagle,A.D,  1899,174THE  CHRONICLE  OFThis  duke  Henry  returned  from  exile  in  company  withThomas,  archbishop  of  Canterbury,  and  Thomas,  earl  ofArundel,  the  son,  who  for  fear  of his  life  had  fled  to  himin  France  from  the  keeping  of  the  duke  of  Exeter,  kingRichard’s  brother;  and  he  landed  on  the  twenty-eighthday of June!  with  scarce  three  hundred  followers,  as  abovesaid,  at  a  deserted  spot  in  the  northern  parts  of the  land.And  there  first  came  to  his  help  the  chief  forester  of hisforest  of  Knaresborough,  Robert  Waterton’,  with  twohundred  foresters;  and  afterwards  the  earls  of Westmore-land  and  Northumberland,  and  the  lords  Willoughby  andGreystock ; and,  in  short,  within  a  few  days  he  stood  intriumph,  with  one  hundred  thousand  fighting  men  at  hisback.  And  two  days  before  the  end  of July  he  arrived  atBristol,  and  there  he  struck  off  the  heads  of  sir  WilliamScrope  °, the  king’s  treasurer,  and  sir  John  Bushy  andsir  Henry  Grene,  knights,  the  king’s  most  evil  councillorsand  the  chief  fosterers  of  his  malice.

He  succeeded  hisADAM  OF  USK175husband  of that  lady,  to  be  taken  into  the  duke’s  follow-ing ; and  I caused  all  the  people  of Usk,  who  for  the  saidresistance  had  gathered  at Monstarri!,  to their  great joy toreturn  to  their  own  homes.A.D.  1899.p.  26.At  length  the  duke  came  to  Hereford  with  his  host,  onthe  second  day  of  August,  and  lodged  in  the  bishop'spalace;  and  on  the  morrow  he  moved  towards  Chester,and  passed  the  night  in  the  priory  of  Leominster.Thenext  night  he  spent  at  Ludlow,  in  the  king’s  castle,  notsparing  the  wine  which  was  therein  stored.At  this  place,I, who  am  now  writing,  obtained  from  the  duke  and  frommy  lord  of  Canterbury  the  release  of  brother  ThomasPrestbury,  master  in theology,  a  man  of my  day at  Oxfordand  a  monk  of  Shrewsbury,  who  was  kept  in  prison  byking Richard,  for that  he  had  righteously  preached  certainthings  against  his  follies;  and  I also  got him  promotion  tothe  abbacy  of his  house*.Then,  passing  through  Shrews-bury, the  duke  tarried  there  two  days;  where  he made  pro-clamation  that  the host  should  march  on  Chester,  but  shouldspare  the  people  and  the  country,  because  by  mediationthey had  submitted  themselves  to  him.Wherefore  manywho  coveted  that  land  for  plunder  departed  to  their  homes.But  little  good  did  the  proclamation  do  for  the  country,  aswill  be seen.The  reasons  why the  duke  decided  to  invadethat  country  were:  because,  abetting  the  king,  as  has  beensaid,  it ceased  not  to  molest  the  realm  for  the  space  of twowhole  years  with  murders,  adulteries,  thefts,  pillage,  andother  unbearable  wrongs;  and  because  it  had  risen  upbrother  as  baron  Cherleton  and  feudal  lord  of  Powis,  in  1401.

And  I, the  writer  of  thischronicle,  spent  a  not  uncheerful  night  in  the  tent  of thelord  of Powis.Many  in  neighbouring  places,  drinking  ofthe  poisoned  cups  given  to  them  by the  people  of Chester,There  also,  from  divers  water-cisterns,  whichperished.the  men  probed  with  spears,  and  from  other  hiding-places,vessels  and  much  other  goods  were  drawn  forth  and  takenfor  plunder,  I being  present  with  the  finders.—On  the  morrow,  which  was  the  eve  of  Saint  Lawrence(9th  August),  I  went  in  the  morning  to  the  church  ofCoddington,  to  celebrate  mass;  but  I found  nothing,  foreverything  was  carried  off  and  doors  and  chests  brokenopen.On  the  same  day  the  duke  of  Lancaster  with  his  hostreached  Chester.  But  first  he mustered  his troops  in a largeand  fair  field,  wherein  was  a  crop  of  standing  corn,  somethree  miles  from  the  city,  on  its  eastern  side,  marshallingtheir  ranks  to the  number  of one  hundred  thousand  fightingmen.  And  it may  be truly  said  that  the  hills  shone  againwith  their  shields.

And  I saw  many  of the  chief  mencome  in  to  the  duke  thus  stripped;  and  many  of  them,whom  he trusted  not,  he  delivered  into  divers  keepings.On  the  eve  of  the  Assumption  of  the  Blessed  Virgin(14th  August)*,  my  lord  of  Canterbury  and  the  earl  ofNorthumberland  went  away  to  the  king  at  the  castle  ofConway,  to treat  with  him  on  the  duke’s  behalf;  and  theking,  on  condition  of  saving  his  dignity,  promised  to  sur-render  to the duke  at the  castle  of Flint.  And so, deliveringup  to them  his two  crowns,  valued  at one  hundred  thousandmarks,  with  other  countless  treasure*,  he  straightway  setforth  to  Flint.  There  the  duke  coming  to him with  twentythousand  chosen  men—the  rest of his  host  being  left  behindto  guard  his  quarters  and  the  country  and  castle  and  cityof  Chester  '—sought  the  king  within  the  castle  (for  he1  Zech,  xiij. 7.2  See  Archeeologia,  xx.  104,  328,  where  Creton  tells  us  how  theEnglish  soldiers  were  pillaged  by the  Welsh  as  they  made  their  waythrough  the  country.8  In the  Traison  et Mort,  195,  the  earl  of  Northumberland  receivesAs, however,  he  was  at  Conway  -his  instructions  on  the  17th  August.on  the  18th  of  the  month,  and  had  to  make  his  arrangements  andpost his  troops,  the  date  in our  chronicle  is probably  the more  correctBoth  Creton  (Arch.  xx.) and  the  author  of  the  Traison  et  Mortone.state  that  Northumberland  alone  was  present  at  Conway,  and  thatthe  archbishop  met  the  king  at  Flint.Consequently,  the  truth  ofRichard’s  promise  to abdicate,  which,  according  to  the  Rolls  of Par-liament  (iij. 416),  was  made  at Conway  to  the  archbishop  and  earl,  isSee  TZratson  et  Mort,  202;  Lingard,  Hist.

And  he led  him  awayprisoner  to  Chester  castle,  where  he  delivered  him  into  safekeeping.Thus,  too,  he  placed  in  custody  certain  lords,taken  along  with  the  king,  to  be  kept  till  the  parliamentwhich  was  to  begin  on  the  morrow  of Michaelmas-day.While  the  duke  was  then  at  Chester,  three  of the  twenty-four  aldermen  of the  city of  London,  on  behalf  of the  samecity,  together  with  other  fifty citizens,  came  to  the  duke,and  recommended  their  city to  him,  under  their  commonseal,  renouncing  their  fealty  to  king  Richard?.They  told,too,  how  the  citizens  had  gathered  in arms  to  Westminsterabbey  to search  for  the  king, hearing  that  he had  in  secretfled  thither;  and  that,  not  finding  him  there,  they  hadordered  to  be  kept  in  custody,  till  parliament,  RogerWalden,  Nicholas  Slake,  and  Ralph  Selby,  the  king’sspecial  councillors,  whom  they  did  find*,  And  so  theduke,  having  gloriously,  within  fifty  days,  conquered  bothking  and  kingdom,  marched  to  London;  and  there  heplaced  the  captive  king in the  Tower,  under  fitting  guard.  .marching  to  Flint.Dr.  Lingard  has  made  some  allowance,  andreduced  the  number  to  80,000.  Twenty  thousand  men  would,  how-ever,  be quite  enough  for  Henry’s  purpose;  and  I have  no  doubt  thatAdam’s  account  of the  disposition  of the  troops  is right.This  comes  from  the  “ Prophetia  Aquile ”  :—“  Exercitus  ejus  admodum  clipei  formabuntur.”—MS.

The  deputation  from  London  is also  said  to  have  met  Henry  atLichfield  (Arch.  xx.  176),  or  at Coventry  (Tratson  et Mort,  212).®  Holinshed  (ed.  1807,  ij. 859)  tells  a  somewhat  similar  story:  thatsome  of the  Londoners  designed  to slay Richard  on  his  arrival  in  thecity,  but,  being  prevented,  “They,  comminge  to Westminster,  tookemaister  John  Sclake,  deane  of  the  king’s  chappell,  and  from  thencebrought  him  to  Newgate,  and  there  laid  him  fast  in  irons.”  RogerWalden  was  shortly  afterwards  deposed  from  the  archbishopric  ofCanterbury.

And  so  Thomas  and  Roger,if I may  say  so,  were  two  archbishops  in  one  church,  liketo  two  heads  on  one  body;  that  is  to  say,  Roger,  then  inpossession  by right,  by the  pope’s  authority,  and  my  lordThomas,  because  he  was  not  yet  restored  by the  pope,  inpossession  in  fact,  by  means  of  the  secular  arm,  whichwas  all-powerful,  because  before  him  alone  was  borneeverywhere  the  cross  of Canterbury,  which  had  been  givenup  to  him  by the  said  Roger.This  Roger  was  a  modestman,  pious  and  courteous,  in  speech  of profitable  and  well-chosen  words,  better  versed  in  things  of  the  camp  and  theworld  than  of the  church  or  the  study.First,  he was  kingRichard’s  French  treasurer  (at Calais),  then  his  secretary,and  at  length  treasurer  of  England  and  the  king’s  chiefHim  the  town  of  Walden  in  Essex  sawcouncillor’.exalted  from  a  butcher’s  son  to the  said  honours,  althoughby  a  too  hasty  leap.  Whence  is  fulfilled  the  proverb:‘  Quick  gains  are  soon  lost”;  and,  again:  “  No  man  wasever  great  all at once.”  And  hence  the  verses:—“  When  the  grave  shall  be uncovered,  bishop  Thomas  shallbe gone,And  upon  the  earth,  uprooted,  falls  the  once  exaltedstone.”“  When  the  grave  shall  be  uncovered”:  that  is, becauseking  Richard  had  it without  ceasing  in  his  sleep  that  thehead  of  the  earl  of  Arundel  was  restored  to  his  body;1  Walden  was  afterwards  restored  to  favour,  and  became  bishop  ofLondon  in 1404.  He  died  in  1406.O194THE  CHRONICLE  OFA.D.  1899,wherefore  he  caused  the  tomb  to  be  opened'.  “BishopThomas  shall  be  gone”:  that  is,  the  banishment  of  thethat  is,same  Thomas.Walden;  which  signifies  the  setting  up  of  stones.Andthis  is  an  ancient  prophecy.“And  upon  the  earth,’  etc.:The  commons  prayed  of  the  king,  in  full  parliament,that  he  would  make  grants  undeservedly  to  no  man,  andspecially  of  such  things  as  belonged  to  the  crown.Andthereupon  the  bishop  of  St.  Asaph?  burst  out  in  thesewords:  “This  petition  is  unmannerly  and  unjust,  in  thatit  argueth  for  niggardliness  in  the  king,  a  thing  which  iscontrary  to  all  royalty,  whereunto  the  bounty  of  an  openhand  is the rather  thought  to be seemly.

And  when  the  duke  had  heard  of  itsqualities,  believing  that  thereby  his  good  fortune  wasforetold,  he  weleomed  the  hound  right  willingly  and  withjoy, and  he  let  it sleep  upon  his  bed.  And  after  the  settingaside  of  king  Richard,  when  it  was  brought  to  him,  itcared  not  to regard  him  at  all  other  than  as  a  private  manwhom  it knew  not  ; which  the  deposed  king  took  sorely  toheart’.1  By a remarkable  coincidence  Froissart  tells  the  story  of the  grey-hound,  though  in  a  different  form.  He  lays  the  scene  at  Flint,  atthe  moment  when  Henry and  Richard  are  preparing  to leave:  “  Entre-tenant  que  on  selloit  et  appareilloit  les  chevaux,  le  roi  Richard  etle comte  (Henri  de  Lancastre)  devisoient  l’un  & l’autre  de  paroles,  etétoient  moult  fort  regardés  d’aucuns  Londriens  qui  la  étoient;  etavint  une  chose  dont  je fus  informé  que  je vous  dirai.Le  roi Richardavoit  un  lévrier,  lequel  on  nommoit  Math,  trés-beau  lévrier  outremesure;  et ne  vouloit  ce  chien  connoitre  nul  homme  fors  le  roi;  etquand  le  roi  devoit  chevaucher,  cil  qui  l’avoit  en  garde  le  laissoitaller,  et ce  lévrier  venoit  tantét  devers  le  roi  festoyer  et  lui  mettoitses  deux  pieds  sur  les  épaules.

Where-fore  the  earls  of  Kent  and  Salisbury,  on  their  way  to  thecounty  of Chester,  to  get the  favour  and  help  of those  whorose  in their  cause,  passed  through  Cirencester;  and  there,on  the  morrow  of  the  Epiphany,  they:  were  beheaded  indeux  pieds  sur  le  col,  et  le  commenca  grandement  &  conjouir.Leduc  de  Lancastre,  qui  point  ne  connoissoit  le  lévrier,  demanda  auroi:  ‘Et  que  veut  ce  lévrier  faire?’—‘  Cousin,’  ce  dit  le  roi,  ‘ce  vousest  grand’  signifiance  et & moi  petite.’-—‘  Comment,’  dit  le duc,  ‘]’en-tendez-vous  ?’—‘ Je  Ventends,’  dit  le  roi,  ‘le  lévrier  vous  festoie  etrecueille  aujourd’hui  comme  roi  d’Angleterre  que  vous  serez,  et  j’enserai  déposé;  et  le  lévrier  en  a  connoissance  naturelle;  si  le  tenezde-lez  vous,  car  il vous  suivra  et il m’éloignera.’  Le  duc  de Lancastreentendit  bien  celle  parole  et conjouit  le lévrier,  lequel  oncques  depuisne  voulut  suivre  Richard  de  Bordeaux,  mais  le  duc  de  Lancastre;et ce  virent  et  scurent  plus  de  trente  mille.”—Froissart,  iv.  75.

The MS.  reads  “  N. Swinford,”  Adam  not  knowing  Swinford’sChristian  name,  and  therefore  writing  “N.”  according  to  commonpractice.  Sir Thomas  Swinford,  afterwards  captain  of Calais,  is meant,for  he is known  to have  had  the  custody  of Richard  (Traison  et Mort,lviij.;  Wyntown,  ed.  Laing,  ix.  20,  ll.  2001-10).Of  the  differenttheories  of Richard’s  death,  that,  which  is supported  by our  chronicle,of gradual  starvation  by his  keepers  seems  to  be  the  most  probable.The  question  has  been  so  fully  discussed  elsewhere,  that  it would  besuperfluous  in this  place  to  repeat  what  has  been  so  often  told  before.As,  however,  Adam  of  Usk  is  a  fresh  authority,  and  an  importantauthority  as  being  a  contemporary,  for  the  theory  of  enforced  starva-tion,  it  may  be  well  to  see  what  the  other  early  chronicles  say  onthis  point.  Walsingham  tells  us  that  on  hearing  of the  death  of hisfriends  Richard  voluntarily  abstained  from  food.  The  continuatorof the  Croyland  chronicle  has the  same  story,  which  is  also  found  in.various  MSS.,  such  as  Cotton  MSS.  Nero  A. vj. and  Galba  E. vij.  TheAnnales  Ricardi  IT.  (Rolls  series)  and  Otterbourne  follow  this  account,but  add  that  after  abstaining  some  time  Richard  was  prevailed  onto try to take  food,  but  that  it was  too  late  as  he  could  not  swallow.The  Monk  of  Evesham  gives  the  account  of  voluntary  abstention,but  adds  an  important  passage:  ‘‘Aliter  tamen  dicitur  et  verius,quod  ibidem  fame  miserabiliter  interiit.”Similarly,  the  Sloane  MS.1776  has  an  alternative:  “Rex  Ricardus  primo  de  Turre  ad  Leedesinfra  Canciam,  sub  custodia  Johannis  Pelham  ibidem;  deinde  adcastrum  de  Pomfrete,  ubi  Robertus  Watyrton  fuerat  custos,  occultedeductus  est,  ubi  non  habuit  spem  alicujus  relevaminis.Et  eciam,pre  nimia  amicorum  suorum  interempcione,  dolore,  tristicia  areptus,non  valuit  consolari;  nec  consolatorem  habens,  diem  clausit  extre-mum,  videlicet  in festo  sancti  Valentini.

Quidam  tamen  opinantur  quod  fame  miserabiliter  ibideminteriit;  hoc  est,  quod  privabatur  penitus  ab  omni  sustentacionenaturali,  usque  ad  diem  sue  resolucionis.”The  Kirkstall  chronicle,Cotton  MS.

The  chronicle  of  Peter  de  Ickham,  in  Harl.MS.  4323,  states  that,  on  his  removal  to  Pontefract,  “per  tempuscertum  custodiebatur,”  and  then,  “tandem a cibo  et potu  per  quatuoraut  quinque  dies  restrictus,  famis  inedia,  cum  xxij.  annis  regnasset,expiravit.”  The  same  version  appears  in  the  chronicles  in  CottonMS.  Domitian  iv., and  Harl.  MS.  3906,  and  again  in  many  copies  ofthe  English  chronicle  of the  Brut.All  these  authorities  are  of value,for,  although  it cannot  be  said  that  they  are  all  contemporary,  theyare  at  least  early  and  sufficiently  near  the  time  to  show  that,  fromthe  first,  rumours  of Richard's  starvation  were  very  generally  believed.Of  a  later  period  is  the  chronicle  in  Cotton  MS.  Titus  D.  x.,  of  theearly  sixteenth  century,  which  has  a  more  embellished  account:  thatRichard,  ‘ductus  de loco  in locum,  tandem,  ut  opinio  est  vulgi,  apudPontifractum  cibi  inedia  interiit.  Nam  dicitur  cibaria  in  singulosdies,  more  regio,  sibi  apposita  fuisse,  sed  esurienti  non  licuisse  degu-stare.”This  appears  in  an  English  dress  in  Harl.  MS.  53, a  versionof the  Brut  chronicle:  ‘In  the  first  yere  of the  regne  of kyng  Henrythe  iiijte,  kyng  Richard,  which  that  was  put  doune  of  his  rialte,  wasin the  castell  of  Pountfret  under  the  ward  of sir Robert  of Watirton,knyght,  and  there  he was  ich  day servet  as  a  kynge  aught  to  be  thathe  myght  se  it, but  he  myght  come  to  non  therof.

Richard  was  apparently  supposed  in  France  to  havebeen  dead  as  early  as  the  end  of January,  a  deed  of Charles  VI.,  datedon  the  29th  of that  month,  referring  to  him  as  “feu  nostre  tres  chierThat  such  rumours  wereet tres  amé  fils  Richard”  (Rymer,  Federa).current  in England  is  proved  by the  well-known  minute  of the  PrivyCouncil  to which  attention  was  first  drawn  by sir  Harris  Nicolas.  Thedate  of  the  council  at which  this  minute  was  passed  has  been  fixedbetween  the  2nd  and  the  8th  February,  and  the  wording  of  theoriginal  memorandum  to  which  the  minute  serves  as  an  answerimplies,  although  it  does  not  express,  an  uncertainty  as  to  whetherRichard  was  actually  then  living.

When  examin-ing  the  original  rough  minutes  of  the  council  preserved  in  theCottonian  library  (Cleopatra  F. iij. f.9),  I was  struck  with  the  carewith  which  an  alteration  in  this  particular  minute  had  been  made,and  then  discovered  that  the  minute  as  we  now  have  it  is  not  theone  which  was  first  written.This  has  been  destroyed.  The  first  leafof the  proceedings  of this  session  of the  council  contains  on  its  facenine  memoranda  or  heads  of business  to  be  discussed,  with  this  title:“Fait  a  remembrer  de  certains  matires  necessairs  a  monsterer  augrant  conseil  du  Roy.”  The  first  memorandum  is:  “  En  primes  si R.nadgairs  Roy soit  uncore  vivant  a  ce  que  len  suppose  quil est,  ordenezsoit  quil  soit  bien  et  seurement  gardez  pur  sauvacion  de  lestat  duRoi  et  de  son  Roiaume.”  On  the  back  of  the  leaf  are  written  fourrough  minutes  in  answer  to  the  first  four  memoranda.  The  minute(the  one  with  which  we  are  concerned)  which  answers  to  the  firstmemorandum  runs  thus:  “A  le  primer  article  soit  parle  au  Roi  qencas  ge  R.  soit  vivant,  quil  soit  mys  en  seuretee  g.  [aggreable  a]  lesseignurs  et ge  sil soit  mort  qadonges  il  soit  monstrez  overtement  aupoeple  quils  en  puissent  avoir  conissance.”  Now  the  leaf is composedof three  pieces  of vellum  which  are  connected  together  so  as  to  formone  sheet.The  first  piece  of vellum,  which  is a  very  narrow  strip,contains  the  first  memorandum  only;  the  second  piece,  the  second,third,  and  fourth  memoranda;  and  the  third  piece,  the  rest.  Theminutes  in  answer  to  the  second,  third,  and  fourth  memoranda  arewritten  immediately  at  their  back;  but  the  first  minute,  instead  ofbeing  written  directly  behind  its  memorandum,  and  on  the  first  pieceof vellum,  as  one  would  expect,  is  entered  below  the  fourth  minuteThe  reason  of  this  is  apparentand  on  the  third  piece  of  vellum.after  examining  the  different  pieces  of vellum,  for  it  is  clear  thatthe  second  piece  has  been  cut  away  at  the  top,  part  of  the  wordsof  the  second  minute  having  been  docked  in  the  process,  and  thatthe  first  narrow  piece  is  an  addition  to  take  the  place  of what  hasThere  can  be  no  doubt  that  what  took  place  wasbeen  cut  away.as  follows  :—The  first  four  memoranda  were  all  written  on  one  piece(now represented,  in a  curtailed  form,  by the  second  piece)  of vellum,and  the  four  minutes  were  written  on  the  back  in proper  order.

The  clerk  there-fore  cut  it away,  and  neeessarily,  along with  it, the  first  memorandumon  the  other  side.  He  then  re-wrote  the  latter  on  the  narrow  stripwhich  he fastened  to  the  head  of  the  sheet,  as  we  now  have  it.  Onthe  back  of  this  narrow  strip  is  the  heading:  “L'informacion  decertains  matires  a  monstrer  a  grant  conseil  nostre  seignur  le Roy,”which,  however,  has  no  connection  with  the  minutes,  but  whichhappened  to  be  on  the  sheet  which  the  clerk  used  for  the  freshtranscript.  Asa  further  proof  how  anxiously  must  have  been  con-sidered  the  form  in  which  the  minute  was  to  appear,  the  words:“seuretee  g.  les  seignurs,”  which  are  an  alteration,  are  written  overan  erasure  very  carefully  made;  whereas,  in  the  second  minute,which  contains  no  state  secret,  but  which  has  been  much  altered,Sirmost  of  the  corrected  words  are  only  crossed  out  with  the  pen.Harris  Nicolas  has  made  use  of  the  contemporary  fair  copy  of theminutes  in the  text  of his  work  (Proceedings  of the  Privy  Council,  1884,i. 111),  and  has  inserted  the  rough  minutes  in  a  foot-note;  but,  bya  strange  oversight,  not  noticing  that  the  first  rough  minute  waswritten  below  the  others,  he has  omitted  it altogether.1  A parallel  is to be found  in  a  chronicle  which  exists  in  two  MSS.in the  British  Museum  :  Cotton,  Titus  D. xv.,  and  Royal  13  A. xix,  :—“Hoc  eciam  anno  Ricardus  rex  in  castello  de  Pounfreit  existens,postquam  audivit  certum  nuncium  de morte  comitum  Huntyngdonie,Sarum,  et  Kancie,  et  maxime  comitis  Huntyngdonie,  fratris  sui,scilicet  Johannis  Holland,  juravit  se  cibum  nunquam  pre  dolorecommesturum ; et  sic  per  quinque  dies  totidemque  noctes  a  cibariiscustoditus  circa  festum  Purificacionis  Beate  Marie  obiit,  ut  adim-pleretur  prophecia  cujusdam  militis  Francie  ad  ejus  coronacionemexistentis,  ubi  vidit  regis  sotularem  ad  terram  cadentem  et  regemad  prandium  cibum  suum  evomentem.

But  afterwards  the  king frankly  restored  him  to  hischurch  and  dignity °.1  Thomas  Despencer,  baron  Despencer,  was  created  earl  of Glouces-ter  in  1397,  but was  degraded  from  that dignity by parliament  in 1399.His  ancestor,  Hugh  Despencer,  the  younger,  became  possessed  ofnearly  the  whole  of  the  county  of  Glamorgan  by his  marriage  withEleanor  de  Clare,  the  niece  of  Edward  II.  He  took  part  in  theconspiracy,  but  escaped  from  Cirencester  when  Kent  and  Salisburywere  killed.  He  was,  however,  immediately  captured  and  carried  toBristol,  and  was  there  beheaded  by the  mob,  on  the  15th  January.2  Henry,  bishop  of Norwich,  was  a younger  brother  of Edward,  baronDespencer,  the  father  of Thomas,  baron  Despencer,  who  was  killed  atBristol.His  arrest  for  complicity  in the  plot  does  not  appear  to  benoticed  elsewhere.A.D.  1400.p.  44.204.THE  CHRONICLE  OFThe  bishop  of Carlisle,  late  a monk  of Westminster,  beingaccused  of  the  said  treason  before  the  king’s  justices,  wasconvicted  and  condemned  by  a  jury  of  laymen,  and  afterlanguishing  for a  season  in chains  in prison  in the  Tower  ofLondon,  his  bishopric  being  given  to  another,  he was  sentback  to  his  old  monastery  to  lead  a  monk’s  life,  thoughnamed  to  the  see  of  Miletus  (?)}.“True!  |In this  year  my  lord  of Canterbury,  calling  together  hisclergy,  mournfully  laid  before  them  how  temporal  powersfear  not  to violate  the  liberties  of  the  church  of  England,and  specially in seizing, imprisoning,  and in judging  bishops,without  distinction,  just  as  they  would  laymen.my  lord,”  I said,  “in  turning  over  the  corpus  of  the  lawand  the  chronicles  more  cruelty  is  found  to  have  beeninflicted  on  prelates  in England  than  in  all  Christendom.”And  I  quoted  the  chapter:  “Sicut  dignum,”?  touchinghomicide,  and  many  others,  and  in  short,  as  to  the  presentcase  of  imprisoning  bishops,  the  Clementine  chapter:  “Siquis  suadente,”  *  touching  penalties,  which  was  decreed  onaccount  of the  imprisonment  of  the  bishop  of Lichfield  ¢, inthe  time  of Edward  the  second,  king  of  England.

Yetfrom  such  gatherings  could  they  not  be  restrained,  untilthe  king  wrote  to their  parents  and  masters  with  grievousthreats  to prevent  them.On  the  third  day  of  the  month  of  May,  the  prince  be-stowed  upon me  a  prebend  in  the  church  of Bangor.Also,  on  the  fourth  day  of  the  same  month  of  May,  ourlord  the  king  being  seated  in judgement  in his  hall  withinthe  Tower  of  London  in  right  royal  state,  my  lord  Morley,who  had  lately  appealed  the  earl  of Salisbury  of treason  ’,for  that  the  said  earl,  on  the  day appointed  for  the  combat,answered  not  to  the  third  summons,  prayed  that  he  beadjudged  traitor  according  to  the  form  of  the  appeal,  andthat  his  pledges  be  condemned  in  costs.

And a certainbrother,  William  Burton,  roused  him,  saying:  “Be  of goodcheer,  for  you  shall  fare well!”  The  abbot  replied:  “  BlessedThebe  God!

And  theWelsh  being  subdued  and  driven  away,  their  prince  withseven  others  lay  hid  for  a  year  among  rocks  and  caves.With  others  who  yielded  peacefully  the  king  dealt  gently,slaying  but  very  few  of  them,  yet  carrying  away  theirchieftains  captive  to  Shrewsbury.But  afterwards  he  setthem  free,  on  condition  of  pursuing  and  taking  those  whostill  held  out  in rebellion  in  Snowdon  and  elsewhere.About  the  feast  of  Saint  Faith  (6th October)  ?, the  earl1  Henry  crossed  the  border  on  the  14th  August.2  The  only  important  success  of  the  English  after  Henry’s  retire-ment  was  that  won,  on  the  29th  September,  by sir Richard  Umfraville,at  Redeswere,  over  a  large  Scottish  force  (Wylie,  Henry  the  Fourth,ADAM  OF  USK209of Northumberland  and  his  son,  the  lord  Henry  Percy,  hada  great  battle  with  the  Scots  who  were  invading  Englandafter  the  king’s  withdrawal;  wherein  they  took  one  hun-dred  knights  and  squires  of the  Scots  and  put  the  rest  toflight.

He  recalled  his  three  nephews,  Matteo,Galeazzo,  and  Bernabo,  from  exile,  and  on  his  death  left  them  todivide  his  possessions.

Concerning  this  matter,  on  the  same  night,  I had  twodreams.The  first  was,  that  I beheld  Saint  Peter,  robed  inhis  bishop’s  vestments,  sitting  without  his  gate,  and  he  castforth  to  earth  another  who  appeared  as  a  pope,  of  sadcountenance  and  foul, and  who  was  sitting  on  his  left  hand.In  the  second,  there  appeared  unto  me  a  fox  chased  bydogs,  which,  taking  the  water,  seized  in his  mouth,  to  keephimself  afloat,  a  branch  of  willow  which  grew  above,  andlay covered  to the  nostrils  ; and, when  he was  again  huntedout  by the  dogs,  in  terror  he  left  the  water,  and,  as  a  lastrefuge,  ran  into  a  hole,  where  forthwith  he  disappeared.Whence  I understood  that  the  fox, though  ever  greedy,  yetever  remaineth  thin ; and  so  Boniface,  though  gorged  wih |simony,  yet to his  dying  day was  never  filled.Whereupon  Boniface,  p. 88.A  certain  German  also  showed  me  a letter  sent  fromother  parts  by the  hands  of a holy man,  wherein  he  declared1  Benedict  XIII.?

Burchard  (47)  says  that  in  his  time  the  ceremony  tookplace  at  the  Monte  Giordano,  but  formerly  near  the  castle  of Sant’Angelo,  from  whence,  however,  the  Jews  were  driven  by the  insultsof the  people.In later  times  (Cérémonies,  etc.,  I. pt. ij.59)  the  scenewas  removed  to the  Coliseum.ADAM  OF  USK265from  his  great-grandson';  whence  we  stand  on  commonground  in  affliction.And  truly  it  was  first  her  empirewhich  devoured  the  world  with  the  sword,  and  next  herpriesthood  with  mummery.Whence  the  lines  :—“The  Roman  bites  at  all;  and  those  he  cannot  bite  heA.D.  1104.p.  92.hates.Of  rich  he  hears  the  call;  but  ’gainst  the  poor  he  shutshis  gates.”And  it  was  thus  that  a  certain  German  spake  who  waspleading  before  me  for  a  benefice,  but  whose  cause  was  soldby forestalling  the  date  in the  papal  camera  :—“Weep,  pitiful  Rome,  for  thy  fame  past  recall ;‘No  man  shall  sell!,  but  Rome  chaffers  for  all.Thus  shalt  thou  pass  away,  thus  shalt  thou  fall.”The  church  of London  being  vacant,  the  college  of audi-tors  with  one  accord  went  up  and  besought  the  pope  totranslate  thither  the  lord  Guy  de  Mona,  bishop  of  St.David's,  and  to make  provision  of the  church  of St. David’sto  me,  the  writer  of  this  history *.

And  in  Marino  Sanudo  it  is  stated  that  “some  of  theJacobites  and  Syrians  who  had  crosses  branded  on  them  said  thiswas  done  for  the  destruction  of  the  pagans,  and  out  of  reverenceto the  Holy  Rood.”A.D,  1404.p.  94.ADAM  OF  USK269unto  the  men  of  that  country  bear  great  reverence,  andwhich  they ofttimes,  and  specially  at  the  feasts  of Easterand  Whitsuntide,  are  wont  to  visit  ; now  therefore,  prayethyour  holiness  your  faithful  chaplain  and  auditor  of  causesof the  sacred  palace  apostolic,  who  first  drew  breath  in thesame  town  or  borough,  and  of whose  blood  are  some  of thesame  sisterhood,  that, having  pity with  fatherly  compassionon  that  monastery  and  prioress  and  nuns,  you  will  deigngraciously  to grant  to  all  Christian  people  who,  so  often  as,on  the  second  days  of  the  said  festivals,  for  all  time  tocome,  they  shall  visit  the  same  chapel,  shall  stretch  forththe  hand  of help  thereto,  some  indulgence,  as  your  holinessshall  think  fit,  with  necessary  and  proper  clauses,  as  inform.”  And  the  pope  signed  it  thus:  “So  be  it, as  it  isasked,”  for  five  years  and  as  many  periods  of  forty  days,as  appeareth  in  the  same  chapel.Being  lodged  near  the  palace  of  St.  Peter,  I watchedthe  habits  of  the  wolves  and  dogs,  often  rising  at  night  tothis  end.For,  while  the  watch-dogs  barked  in  the  gate-ways  of  their  masters’  houses,  the  wolves  carried  off  thesmaller  dogs from  the  midst  of the larger ones,  and although,when  thus  seized,  the  dogs,  hoping  to  be  defended  by theirlarger  companions,  howled  the  more,  yet  the  latter  neverstirred  from  their  posts,  though  their  barking waxed  louder.And  so  I pondered  on  the  same  sort  of  league  which  weknow  doth  exist  in  our  parts  between  the  great  men  of thecountry  and  the  exiles  of the  woods.The  viper  race  of  Lombardy,  split  up  into  Guelphs  and |Ghibellines,  with  plundering  and  fire  and  slaughter,  andeven  eating  the  flesh  of the  dead  and  dashing  against  rockstheir  own  offspring if they took  the  opposite  side, destroyedeach  other  and  certain  of their  cities  at this  time.The Romans, about  Quinquagesima  Sunday, meet  togetherfor  public  games,  with  the  captains  of  their  differentquarters,  in a  large  well-equipped  body;  and,  according  tothe  words  of  Saint  Paul:  “They  which  run  in  a  race  runA.D,  1404.270THE  CHRONICLE  OFall,” 1  they  strive  manfully  for  the  prize.

Andthen  every  man  pell-mell  rushes  at  the  beasts  with  hisweapon ; and,  if it so  happen  that  any  one  brings  not  hometo  his  wife  some  part  of  the  spoil,  he  is  accounted  a  poorspirit  and  a  craven  who  shall  not  have  her  company  till  thefeast  of  Saint  Pancras.  And  often  in  the  scuffle  they  cutdown  or  wound  in particular  the  courtiers  whom  they  hatefor  wrongs  done  to wives  and  daughters.After  this, they set up on  the points  of spears  three  cloths,one  of gold for  the  best horses,  and  another  of silver  for the1  1 Cor.  ix,  24.2  The  Monte  Testaccio,  an  artificial  mound  of some  size,  measuringin  circumference  at  the  base  about  half  a  mile,  situated  near  theTiber,  to  the  south  of the  Aventine.It was  the  rubbish-heap  of theRomans,  which  began  to accumulate,  it  is thought,  about  the  begin-ning  of the  empire.

And  there  Richard  Lancaster,  king  of  arms?!,  coun-selled  me,  for  that  the  king  threatened  me  with  death,  thatI should  in  no  wise  enter  into  England,  without  his  royalgrace  first  assured;  which  indeed  he  promised  to  obtainfor  me,  and  on  account  of  which  I waited  for  him  inthose  parts  for  the  space  of  two  years,  although  to  nopurpose.I had  it also  that  all  my  benefices  had  been  granted  toothers,  [whereby  my  substance]  was  forspent  to  the  sum  ofhundreds  of  marks.To  be  brief,  I pondered  many  things.But  with  Job  I cried:  “  Shall  we  receive  good  at  the  handof God,  and  shall  we  not  receive  evil?”  ?A.D.  1406.A.D.  14061408.In  the  said  space  of  two  years  I travelled  through  thelands  of Flanders  and  France  and  Normandy  and  Brittany,serving as  counsel  to  many  bishops  and  abbots  and  princes  ;and  I got me  some  gain thereby.  And  twice  in that  season,while  I was  sleeping,  I was  clean  stripped,  at least  on  thesecond  time,  even  to my  breeches,  by certain  Welshmen  inwhom  I had  placed  my  trust.

John  Trevaur,  or  Trevor,  created  bishop  of  St.  Asaph  in  1395.After  serving  the  crown  staunchly  for  many  years,  he  went  over  toOwen  in  1404,  and  was  immediately  deprived.  He  was  concerned  inNorthumberland’s  rebellion,  and  fled  with  him  into  Scotland  in  1405;and  he remained  true  to  Owen’s  cause  for  the  rest  of his  life  (Wylie,Henry  the  Fourth,  ij.10).

Adam  was  no  doubt  personally  acquaintedwith  Trevaur,  and  he is curiously  precise  in his  statement  of the  placeand  date  of his  death.But,  whatever  the  rest  of  the  statement  maybe worth,  the  fact  that  the  see  was  filled  in  1411  and  not  till  thenseems  to  substantiate  the  date  of 1410  as  the  year  of Trevaur’s  death  ;and  1412  in the  text  may  be  only a clerical  error.8  The  monastery  of St.  Bartholomew  of Eeckhout,  an  early founda-tion,  which  was  demolished  in  1798.A.D.  1406,288THE  CHRONICLE  OFstraight  against  the  belfry of Saint  Mary, and, being  severedin  twain  by the  blow,  it  drove  apart  its  two  portions  tofall  over  against  the  doors  of  the  said  earl  and  lord:  amighty  token,  as  did  afterwards  appear,  of their  ruin.In  the  chronicles  of  the  same  monastery,  I found  thiswhich  here  follows,  written  in  mockery  of  the  French,for  that  in  former  days  they  were  routed  by the  men  ofFlanders  :—The  Passion  of the  French,  according  to  the  Flemings}.p.  110.p.  111.Likewise  I found  it recorded  in the  chronicle  of Martinus,in  the  history  of Constantine  the  second,  that  in  a  veryancient  tomb  at  Constantinople  there  was  found  a  plate  ofgold  with  this  writing  thereon:  “Jesus  Christ  shall  beborn  of  the  Virgin  Mary;  and  I  believe  in Him.”Also,that  in  Spain  a  certain  Jew,  while  he  was  breaking  upsome  stony  ground  wherein  to  plant  vines,  found  inthe  middle  of  a  rock  which  he  clove  asunder  a  book  ofleaves  of  stone  containing  the  same  words,  and  further-more  setting  forth  the  division  of  the  course  of  theworld  into  three  parts,  from  Adam  even  unto  Antichrist,and  of  each  part  its  conditions.And  of  Christ  it  thusbegan:  “Jesus  Christ,  the  Son  of  God,  shall  be  born  ofthe  Virgin  Mary,  and  He  shall  suffer  for  the  people;  andI  believe  in Him.
