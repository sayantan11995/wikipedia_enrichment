CHAPTER XXXITHE GRAMMAR OF SCIENCE (1903)OF all the travels made by man since the voyages of Dante,this new exploration along the shores of Multiplicity andComplexity promised to be the longest, though as yet ithad barely touched two familiar regions — race and sex. Evenwithin these narrow seas the navigator lost his bearings and fol-lowed the winds as they blew. By chance it happened thatRaphael Pumpelly helped the winds; for, being in Washington onhis way to Central Asia he fell to talking with Adams about thesematters, and said that Willard Gibbs thought he got most helpfrom a book called the "Grammar of Science," by Karl Pearson.To Adams's vision, Willard Gibbs stood on the same plane withthe three or four greatest minds of his century, and the idea that aman so incomparably superior should find help anywhere filledhim with wonder. He sent for the volume and read it. From thetime he sailed for Europe and reached his den on the Avenue duBois until he took his return steamer at Cherbourg on December 26,he did little but try to find out what Karl Pearson could havetaught Willard Gibbs.Here came in, more than ever, the fatal handicap of ignorancein mathematics. Not so much the actual tool was needed, as theright to judge the product of the tool. Ignorant as one was of thefiner values of French or German, and often deceived by the intri-cacies of thought hidden in the muddiness of the medium, one couldsometimes catch a tendency to intelligible meaning even in Kantor Hegel; but one had not the right to a suspicion of error wherethe tool of thought was algebra. Adams could see in such parts ofthe "Grammar" as he could understand, little more than anenlargement of Stallo's book already twenty years old. He neverfound out what it could have taught a master like Willard Gibbs.45°The Education of Henry AdamsYet the book had a historical value out of all proportion to itsscience. No such stride had any Englishman before taken in thelines of English thought. The progress of science was measuredby the success of the "Grammar," when, for twenty years past,Stallo had been deliberately ignored under the usual conspiracy ofsilence inevitable to all thought which demands new thought-machinery. Science needs time to reconstruct its instruments, tofollow a revolution in space; a certain lag is inevitable; the mostactive mind cannot instantly swerve from its path; but such revo-lutions are portentous, and the fall or rise of half-a-dozen empiresinterested a student of history less than the rise of the "Grammarof Science," the more pressingly because, under the silent influenceof Langley, he was prepared to expect it.For a number of years Langley had published in his SmithsonianReports the revolutionary papers that foretold the overthrow ofnineteenth-century dogma, and among the first was the famousaddress of Sir William Crookes on psychical research, followed bya series of papers on Roentgen and Curie, which had steadilydriven the scientific lawgivers of Unity into the open; but KarlPearson was the first to pen them up for slaughter in the schools.The phrase is not stronger than that with which the "Grammar ofScience" challenged the fight: "Anything more hopelessly illogicalthan the statements with regard to Force and Matter current inelementary textbooks of science, it is difficult to imagine," openedMr. Pearson, and the responsible author of the "elementary text-book," as he went on to explain, was Lord Kelvin himself. Pearsonshut out of science everything which the nineteenth century hadbrought into it. He told his scholars that they must put up with afraction of the universe, and a very small fraction at that — thecircle reached by the senses, where sequence could be taken forgranted — much as the deep-sea fish takes for granted the circleof light which he generates. "Order and reason, beauty andbenevolence, are characteristics and conceptions which we findsolely associated with the mind of man." The assertion, as a broadThe Grammar of Science451truth, left one's mind in some doubt of its bearing, for order andbeauty seemed to be associated also in the mind of a crystal, ifone's senses were to be admitted as judge; but the historian had nointerest in the universal truth of Pearson's or Kelvin's or Newton'slaws; he sought only their relative drift or direction, and Pearsonwent on to say that these conceptions must stop : " Into the chaosbeyond sense-impressions we cannot scientifically project them."We cannot even infer them: "In the chaos behind sensations, inthe 'beyond' of sense-impressions, we cannot infer necessity, orderor routine, for these are concepts formed by the mind of man onthis side of sense-impressions"; but we must infer chaos: "Brieflychaos is all that science can logically assert of the supersensuous."The kinetic theory of gas is an assertion of ultimate chaos. Inplain words, Chaos was the law of nature; Order was the dreamof man.No one means all he says, and yet very few say all they mean,for words are slippery and thought is viscous; but since Baconand Newton, English thought had gone on impatiently protest-ing that no one must try to know the unknowable at the same timethat every one went on thinking about it. The result was aschaotic as kinetic gas; but with the thought a historian had nothingto do. He sought only its direction. For himself he knew, that, inspite of all the Englishmen that ever lived, he would be forced toenter supersensual chaos if he meant to find out what became ofBritish science — or indeed of any other science. From Pythag-oras to Herbert Spencer, every one had done it, although com-monly science had explored an ocean which it preferred to regard asUnity or a Universe, and called Order. Even Hegel, who taughtthat every notion included its own negation, used the negationonly to reach a " larger synthesis," till he reached the universalwhich thinks itself, contradiction and all. The Church alone hadconstantly protested that anarchy was not order, that Satan wasnot God, that pantheism was worse than atheism, and that Unitycould not be proved as a contradiction. Karl Pearson seemed to45 2The Education of Henry Adamsagree with the Church, but every one else, including Newton,Darwin and Clerk Maxwell, had sailed gaily into the supersensual,calling it : —"One God, one Law, one Element,And one far-off, divine event,To which the whole creation moves."Suddenly, in 1900, science raised its head and denied.Yet, perhaps, after all, the change had not been so sudden as itseemed. Real and actual, it certainly was, and every newspaperbetrayed it, but sequence could scarcely be denied by one who hadwatched its steady approach, thinking the change far more inter-esting to history than the thought. When he reflected about it,he recalled that the flow of tide had shown itself at least twentyyears before; that it had become marked as early as 1893 ; and thatthe man of science must have been sleepy indeed who did not jumpfrom his chair like a scared dog when, in 1898, Mme. Curie threwon his desk the metaphysical bomb she called radium. There re-mained no hole to hide in. Even metaphysics swept back overscience with the green water of the deep-sea ocean and no one couldlonger hope to bar out the unknowable, for the unknowable wasknown.The fact was admitted that the uniformitarians of one's youthhad wound about their universe a tangle of contradictions meantonly for temporary support to be merged in "larger synthesis,"and had waited for the larger synthesis in silence and in vain. Theyhad refused to hear Stallo. They had betrayed little interest inCrookes. At last their universe had been wrecked by rays, andKarl Pearson undertook to cut the wreck loose with an axe, leav-ing science adrift on a sensual raft in the midst of a supersensualchaos. The confusion seemed, to a mere passenger, worse thanthat of 1600 when the astronomers upset the world; it resembledrather the convulsion of 310 when the Civitas Dei cut itself loosefrom the Civitas Romae, and the Cross took the place of the legions;but the historian accepted it all alike; he knew that his opinionThe Grammar of Science453was worthless; only, in this case, he found himself on the raft,personally and economically concerned in its drift.English thought had always been chaos and multiplicity itself,in which the new step of Karl Pearson marked only a consistentprogress; but German thought had affected system, unity, andabstract truth, to a point that fretted the most patient foreigner,and to Germany the voyager in strange seas of thought alone mightresort with confident hope of renewing his youth. Turning hisback on Karl Pearson and England, he plunged into Germany,and had scarcely crossed the Rhine when he fell into librariesof new works bearing the names of Ostwald, Ernst Mach, ErnstHaeckel, and others less familiar, among whom Haeckel waseasiest to approach, not only because of being the oldest andclearest and steadiest spokesman of nineteenth-century mechani-cal convictions, but also because in 1902 he had published a vehe-ment renewal of his faith. The volume contained only one para-graph that concerned a historian; it was that in which Haeckelsank his voice almost to a religious whisper in avowing withevident effort, that the "proper essence of substance appeared tohim more and more marvellous and enigmatic as he penetratedfurther into the knowledge of its attributes — matter and energy— and as he learned to know their innumerable phenomena andtheir evolution. " Since Haeckel seemed to have begun the voyageinto multiplicity that Pearson had forbidden to Englishmen, heshould have been a safe pilot to the point, at least, of a " properessence of substance" in its attributes of matter and energy; butErnst Mach seemed to go yet one step further, for he rejectedmatter altogether, and admitted but two processes in nature —— Motion was Matter — the thing moved.change of place and interconversion of forms. Matter was MotionA student of history had no need to understand these scientificideas of very great men; he sought only the relation with the ideasof their grandfathers, and their common direction towards theideas of their grandsons. He had long ago reached, with Hegel,454The Education of Henry Adamsthe limits of contradiction; and Ernst Mach scarcely added ashade of variety to the identity of opposites; but both of themseemed to be in agreement with Karl Pearson on the facts of thesupersensual universe which could be known only as unknowable.With a deep sigh of relief, the traveller turned back to France.There he felt safe. No Frenchman except Rabelais and Mon-taigne had ever taught anarchy other than as path to order. Chaoswould be unity in Paris even if child of the guillotine. To make thisassurance mathematically sure, the highest scientific authorityin France was a great mathematician, M. Poincare of the In-stitut, who published in 1902 a small volume called *La Scienceet lliypothese," which purported to be relatively readable.Trusting to its external appearance, the traveller timidly boughtit, and greedily devoured it, without understanding a singleconsecutive page, but catching here and there a period thatstartled him to the depths of his ignorance, for they seemed to showthat M. Poincare was troubled by the same historical landmarkswhich guided or deluded Adams himself: "[In science] we are led,"said M. Poincare, "to act as though a simple law, when other thingswere equal, must be more probable than a complicated law. Halfa century ago one frankly confessed it, and proclaimed that natureloves simplicity. She has since given us too often the lie. To-daythis tendency is no longer avowed, and only as much of it is pre-served as is indispensable so that science shall not become impos-sible."Here at last was a fixed point beyond the chance of confusionwith self-suggestion. History and mathematics agreed. Had M.Poincare shown anarchistic tastes, his evidence would have weighedless heavily; but he seemed to be the only authority in sciencewho felt what a historian felt so strongly — the need of unity in auniverse. " Considering everything we have made some approachtowards unity. We have not gone as fast as we hoped fifty yearsago; we have not always taken the intended road; but definitelywe have gained much ground." This was the most clear and con-The Grammar of Science:455vincing evidence of progress yet offered to the navigator of igno-rance; but suddenly he fell on another view which seemed to himquite irreconcilable with the first: "Doubtless if our means of in-vestigation should become more and more penetrating, we shoulddiscover the simple under the complex; then the complex underthe simple; then anew the simple under the complex; and so onwithout ever being able to foresee the last term. ,,A mathematical paradise of endless displacement promised eter-nal bliss to the mathematician, but turned the historian greenwith horror. Made miserable by the thought that he knew nomathematics, he burned to ask whether M. Poincare knew anyhistory, since he began by begging the historical question alto-gether, and assuming that the past showed alternating phases ofsimple and complex — the precise point that Adams, after fiftyyears of effort, found himself forced to surrender; and then goingon to assume alternating phases for the future which, for the wearyTitan of Unity, differed in nothing essential from the kinetictheory of a perfect gas.Since monkeys first began to chatter in trees, neither man norbeast had ever denied or doubted Multiplicity, Diversity, Complex-ity, Anarchy, Chaos. Always and everywhere the Complex hadbeen true and the Contradiction had been certain. Thought startedby it. Mathematics itself began by counting one — two — three;then imagining their continuity, which M. Poincare was still ex-hausting his wits to explain or defend ; and this was his explanation"In short, the mind has the faculty of creating symbols, and it isthus that it has constructed mathematical continuity which isonly a particular system of symbols/' With the same light touch,more destructive in its artistic measure than the heaviest-handedbrutality of Englishmen or Germans, he went on to upset relativetruth itself: "How should I answer the question whether EuclidianGeometry is true? It has no sense! .. Euclidian Geometry is, andwill remain, the most convenient.Chaos was a primary fact even in Paris — especially in Paris —,,.456The Education of Henry Adamsas it was in the Book of Genesis ; but every thinking being in Parisor out of it had exhausted thought in the effort to prove Unity,Continuity, Purpose, Order, Law, Truth, the Universe, God,after having begun by taking it for granted, and discovering, totheir profound dismay, that some minds denied it. The directionof mind, as a single force of nature, had been constant since historybegan. Its own unity had created a universe the essence of whichwas abstract Truth; the Absolute; God! To Thomas Aquinas,the universe was still a person; to Spinoza, a substance; to Kant,Truth was the essence of the "I"; an innate conviction; a cate-gorical imperative; to Poincare, it was a convenience; and to KarlPearson, a medium of exchange.The historian never stopped repeating to himself that he knewnothing about it; that he was a mere instrument of measure, abarometer, pedometer, radiometer; and that his whole share in thematter was restricted to the measurement of thought-motion asmarked by the accepted thinkers. He took their facts for granted.He knew no more than a firefly about rays — or about race — orsex — or ennui — or a bar of music — or a pang of love — ora grain of musk— or of phosphorus— or conscience— or duty— or the force of Euclidian geometry — or non-Euclidian — orheat — or light — or osmosis — or electrolysis — or the magnet—• or ether — or vis inertiae — or gravitation — or cohesion— orelasticity — or surface tension — or capillary attraction — or'Brownian motion — or of some scores, or thousands, or millionsof chemical attractions, repulsions or indifferences which were busywithin and without him; or, in brief, of Force itself, which, hewas credibly informed, bore some dozen definitions in the text-books, mostly contradictory, and all, as he was assured, beyondhis intelligence; but summed up in the dictum of the last and high-est science, that Motion seems to be Matter and Matter seems tobe Motion, yet "we are probably incapable of discovering" whateither is. History had no need to ask what either might be; allit needed to know was the admission of ignorance; the mere fact ofThe Grammar of Science457multiplicity baffling science. Even as to the fact, science disputed,but radium happened to radiate something that seemed to explodethe scientific magazine, bringing thought, for the time, to a stand-still; though, in the line of thought-movement in history, radiumwas merely the next position, familiar and inexplicable since Zenoand his arrow: continuous from the beginning of time, and dis-continuous at each successive point. History set it down on therecord — pricked its position on the chart — and waited to beled, or misled, once more.The historian must not try to know what is truth, if he valueshis honesty; for, if he cares for his truths, he is certain to falsifyhis facts. The laws of history only repeat the lines of force orthought. Yet though his will be iron, he cannot help now andthen resuming his humanity or simianity in face of a fear. Themotion of thought had the same value as the motion of a cannon-ball seen approaching the observer on a direct line through theair. One could watch its curve for five thousand years.violent acceleration in historical times had ended in the catastropheof 310. The next swerve of direction occurred towards 1500.Galileo and Bacon gave a still newer curve to it, which altered itsvalues; but all these changes had never altered the continuity.Only in 1900, the continuity snapped.Its firstVaguely conscious of the cataclysm, the world sometimes datedit from 1893, by the Roentgen rays, or from 1898, by the Curie'sradium; but in 1904, Arthur Balfour announced on the part ofBritish science that the human race without exception had livedand died in a world of illusion until the last year of the century.The date was convenient, and convenience was truth.The child born in 1900 would, then, be born into a new worldwhich would not be a unity but a multiple. Adams tried to imag-ine it, and an education that would fit it. He found himself in aland where no one had ever penetrated before; where order wasan accidental relation obnoxious to nature; artificial compulsionimposed on motion; against which every free energy of the uni-458The Education of Henry Adamsverse revolted; and which, being merely occasional, resolved itselfback into anarchy at last. He could not deny that the law ofthe new multiverse explained much that had been most obscure,especially the persistently fiendish treatment of man by man;the perpetual effort of society to establish law, and the perpetualrevolt of society against the law it had established; the perpetualbuilding up of authority by force, and the perpetual appeal toforce to overthrow it; the perpetual symbolism of a higher law,and the perpetual relapse to a lower one; the perpetual victory ofthe principles of freedom, and their perpetual conversion into prin-ciples of power; but the staggering problem was the outlook aheadinto the despotism of artificial order which nature abhorred. Thephysicists had a phrase for it, unintelligible to the vulgar: "All thatwe win is a battle — lost in advance — with the irreversible phe-nomena in the background of nature/'All that a historian won was a vehement wish to escape. Hesaw his education complete, and was sorry he ever began it. Asa matter of taste, he greatly preferred his eighteenth-centuryeducation when God was a father and nature a mother, and allwas for the best in a scientific universe. He repudiated all sharein the world as it was to be, and yet he could not detect the pointwhere his responsibility began or ended.As history unveiled itself in the new order, man's mind hadbehaved like a young pearl oyster, secreting its universe to suitits conditions until it had built up a shell of nacre that embodiedall its notions of the perfect. Man knew it was true because hemade it, and he loved it for the same reason. He sacrificed millionsof lives to acquire his unity, but he achieved it, and justly thoughtit a work of art. The woman especially did great things, creatingher deities on a higher level than the male, and, in the end, com-pelling the man to accept the Virgin as guardian of the man's God.The man's part in his Universe was secondary, but the womanwas at home there, and sacrificed herself without limit to makeit habitable, when man permitted it, as sometimes happened forThe Grammar of Science459brief intervals of war and famine; but she could not provideShe did not think of herprotection against forces of nature.universe as a raft to which the limpets stuck for life in the surgeof a supersensual chaos; she conceived herself and her family asthe centre and flower of an ordered universe which she knew tobe unity because she had made it after the image of her ownfecundity; and this creation of hers was surrounded by beautiesand perfections which she knew to be real because she herself hadimagined them.Even the masculine philosopher admired and loved and cele-brated her triumph, and the greatest of them sang it in the noblestof his verses : —"Alma Venus, coeli subter labentia signaQuae mare navigerum, quae terras frugiferenteisConcelebrasQuae quoniam rerum naturam sola gubernas,Nee sine te quidquam dias in luminis orasExoritur, neque fit laetum neque amabile quidquam;Te sociam studeo!"Neither man nor woman ever wanted to quit this Eden of theirown invention, and could no more have done it of their ownaccord than the pearl oyster could quit its shell; but although theoyster might perhaps assimilate or embalm a grain of sand forcedinto its aperture, it could only perish in face of the cyclonic hurri-cane or the volcanic upheaval of its bed. Her supersensual chaoskilled her.Such seemed the theory of history to be imposed by science onthe generation born after 1900. For this theory, Adams felt him-self in no way responsible. Even as historian he had made it hisduty always to speak with respect of everything that had everbeen thought respectable — except an occasional statesman; buthe had submitted to force all his life, and he meant to accept itfor the future as for the past. All his efforts had been turned onlyto the search for its channel. He never invented his facts; they460The Education of Henry Adamswere furnished him by the only authorities he could find. As forhimself, according to Helmholz, Ernst Mach, and Arthur Bal-four, he was henceforth to be a conscious ball of vibrating mo-tions, traversed in every direction by infinite lines of rotation orvibration, rolling at the feet of the Virgin at Chartres or of M.Poincare in an attic at Paris, a centre of supersensual chaos.The discovery did not distress him. A solitary man of sixty-fiveyears or more, alone in a Gothic cathedral or a Paris apartment,need fret himself little about a few illusions more or less. He shouldhave learned his lesson fifty years earlier; the times had long passedwhen a student could stop before chaos or order; he had no choicebut to march with his world.Nevertheless, he could not pretend that his mind felt flatteredby this scientific outlook. Every fabulist has told how the humanmind has always struggled like a frightened bird to escape thechaos which caged it; how — appearing suddenly and inexplicablyout of some unknown and unimaginable void ; passing half its knownlife in the mental chaos of sleep; victim even when awake, to itsown ill-adjustment, to disease, to age, to external suggestion, tonature's compulsion; doubting its sensations, and, in the last re-sort, trusting only to instruments and averages — after sixtyor seventy years of growing astonishment, the mind wakes to finditself looking blankly into the void of death. That it should pro-fess itself pleased by this performance was all that the highestrules of good breeding could ask; but that it should actually besatisfied would prove that it existed only as idiocy.Satisfied, the future generation could scarcely think itself, foreven when the mind existed in a universe of its own creation, ithad never been quite at ease. As far as one ventured to interpretactual science, the mind had thus far adjusted itself by an infiniteseries of infinitely delicate adjustments forced on it by the infi-nite motion of an infinite chaos of motion; dragged at one momentinto the unknowable and unthinkable, then trying to scrambleback within its senses and to bar the chaos out, but always as-The Grammar of Science461similating bits of it, until at last, in 1900, a new avalanche ofunknown forces had fallen on it, which required new mental powersto control. If this view was correct, the mind could gain nothingby flight or by fight; it must merge in its supersensual multiverse,or succumb to it.
