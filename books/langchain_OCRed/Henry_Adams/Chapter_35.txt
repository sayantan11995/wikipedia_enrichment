CHAPTER XXXVNUNC AGE (1905)NEARLY forty years had passed since the ex-privatesecretary landed at New York with the ex-MinistersAdams and Motley, when they saw American society asa long caravan stretching out towards the plains. As he came upthe bay again, November 5, 1904, an older man than either hisfather or Motley in 1868, he found the approach more striking thanever — wonderful — unlike anything man had ever seen — andlike nothing he had ever much cared to see. The outline of the citybecame frantic in its effort to explain something that defied mean-ing. Power seemed to have outgrown its servitude and to haveasserted its freedom. The cylinder had exploded, and throwngreat masses of stone and steam against the sky. The city had theair and movement of hysteria, and the citizens were crying, inevery accent of anger and alarm, that the new forces must at anycost be brought under control. Prosperity never before imagined,power never yet wielded by man, speed never reached by anythingbut a meteor, had made the world irritable, nervous, querulous,unreasonable and afraid. All New York was demanding new men,and all the new forces, condensed into corporations, were demand-ing a new type of man — a man with ten times the endurance,energy, will and mind of the old type — for whom they wereready to pay millions at sight. As one jolted over the pavementsor read the last week's newspapers, the new man seemed close athand, for the old one had plainly reached the end of his strength,and his failure had become catastrophic. Every one saw it, andevery municipal election shrieked chaos. A traveller in the high-ways of history looked out of the club window on the turmoil ofFifth Avenue, and felt himself in Rome, under Diocletian, witness-ing the anarchy, conscious of the compulsion, eager for the solu-500The Education of Henry Adamstion, but unable to conceive whence the next impulse was to comeor how it was to act. The two-thousand-years failure of Christian-ity roared upward from Broadway, and no Constantine the Greatwas in sight.Having nothing else to do, the traveller went on to Washingtonto wait the end. There Roosevelt was training Constantines andbattling Trusts. With the Battle of Trusts, a student of mechanicsfelt entire sympathy, not merely as a matter of politics or society,but also as a measure of motion. The Trusts and Corporationsstood for the larger part of the new power that had been createdsince 1840, and were obnoxious because of their vigorous and un-scrupulous energy. They were revolutionary, troubling all the oldconventions and values, as the screws of ocean steamers musttrouble a school of herring. They tore society to pieces and tram-pled it under foot. As one of their earliest victims, a citizen ofQuincy, born in 1838, had learned submission and silence, for heknew that, under the laws of mechanics, any change, within therange of the forces, must make his situation only worse; but hewas beyond measure curious to see whether the conflict of forceswould produce the new man, since no other energies seemed lefton earth to breed. The new man could be only a child born of con-tact between the new and the old energies.Both had been familiar since childhood, as the story has shown,and neither had warped the umpire's judgment by its favors. Ifever judge had reason to be impartial, it was he. The sole objectof his interest and sympathy was the new man, and the longer onewatched, the less could be seen of him. Of the forces behind theTrusts, one could see something; they owned a complete organiza-tion, with schools, training, wealth and purpose; but of the forcesbehind Roosevelt one knew little; their cohesion was slight; theirtraining irregular; their objects vague. The public had no ideawhat practical system it could aim at, or what sort of men couldmanage it. The single problem before it was not so much to con-trol the Trusts as to create the society that could manage theNunc Age501Trusts. The new American must be either the child of the newforces or a chance sport of nature. The attraction of mechanicalpower had already wrenched the American mind into a crab-likeprocess which Roosevelt was making heroic efforts to restore toeven action, and he had every right to active support and sympa-thy from all the world, especially from the Trusts themselves sofar as they were human; but the doubt persisted whether the forcethat educated was really man or nature — mind or motion. Themechanical theory, mostly accepted by science, seemed to requirethat the law of mass should rule. In that case, progress would con-tinue as before.In that, or any other case, a nineteenth-century education wasas useless or misleading as an eighteenth-century education hadbeen to the child of 1838; but Adams had a better reason for hold-ing his tongue. For his dynamic theory of history he cared nomore than for the kinetic theory of gas; but, if it were an approachto measurement of motion, it would verify or disprove itself withinthirty years. At the calculated acceleration, the head of themeteor-stream must very soon pass perihelion. Therefore, disputewas idle, discussion was futile, and silence, next to good-temper,was the mark of sense. If the acceleration, measured by the de-velopment and economy of forces, were to continue at its ratesince 1800, the mathematician of 1950 should be able to plot thepast and future orbit of the human race as accurately as that ofthe November meteoroids.Naturally such an attitude annoyed the players in the game, asthe attitude of the umpire is apt to infuriate the spectators. Aboveall, it was profoundly unmoral, and tended to discourage effort.On the other hand, it tended to encourage foresight and to econo-mize waste of mind. If it was not itself education, it pointed outthe economies necessary for the education of the new American.There, the duty stopped.There, too, life stopped. Nature has educated herself to a singu-lar sympathy for death. On the antarctic glacier, nearly five thou-502The Education of Henry Adamssand feet above sea-level, Captain Scott found carcasses of seals,where the animals had laboriously flopped up, to die in peace."Unless we had actually found these remains, it would have beenpast believing that a dying seal could have transported itself overfifty miles of rough, steep, glacier-surface," but "the seal seemsoften to crawl to the shore or the ice to die, probably from its in-,, In India, Purun Dass, atstinctive dread of its marine enemies.the end of statesmanship, sought solitude, and died in sanctityamong the deer and monkeys, rather than remain with man. Evenin America, the Indian Summer of life should be a little sunny anda little sad, like the season, and infinite in wealth and depth oftone — but never hustled. For that reason, one's own passiveobscurity seemed sometimes nearer nature than John Hay'sexposure. To the normal animal the instinct of sport is innate,and historians themselves were not exempt from the passion ofbaiting their bears; but in its turn even the seal dislikes to beworried to death in age by creatures that have not the strengthor the teeth to kill him outright.On reaching Washington, November 14, 1904, Adams saw at aglance that Hay must have rest. Already Mrs. Hay had bade himprepare to help in taking her husband to Europe as soon as theSession should be over, and although Hay protested that the ideacould not even be discussed, his strength failed so rapidly that hecould not effectually discuss it, and ended by yielding withoutstruggle. He would equally have resigned office and retired, likePurun Dass, had not the President and the press protested; buthe often debated the subject, and his friends could throw no lighton it. Adams himself, who had set his heart on seeing Hay closehis career by making peace in the East, could only urge that vanityfor vanity, the crown of peacemaker was worth the cross of martyr-dom; but the cross was full in sight, while the crown was still un-certain. Adams found his formula for Russian inertia exasper-atingly correct. He thought that Russia should have negotiatedinstantly on the fall of Port Arthur, January 1, 1905 ; he foundNunc Age503that she had not the energy, but meant to wait till her navy shouldbe destroyed. The delay measured precisely the time that Hayhad to spare.The close of the Session on March 4 left him barely the strengthto crawl on board ship, March 18, and before his steamer hadreached half her course, he had revived, almost as gay as when hefirst lighted on the Markoe house in I Street forty- four years earlier.The clouds that gather round the setting sun do not always take asober coloring from eyes that have kept watch on mortality; or,at least, the sobriety is sometimes scarcely sad. One walks withone's friends squarely up to the portal of life, and bids good-byewith a smile. One has done it so often! Hay could scarcely pacethe deck; he nourished no illusions; he was convinced that heshould never return to his work, and he talked lightly of the death-sentence that he might any day expect, but he threw off the color-ing of office and mortality together, and the malaria of power leftits only trace in the sense of tasks incomplete.One could honestly help him there. Laughing frankly at hisdozen treaties hung up in the Senate Committee-room like lambsin a butcher's shop, one could still remind him of what was solidlycompleted. In his eight years of office he had solved nearly everyold problem of American statesmanship, and had left little ornothing to annoy his successor. He had brought the great Atlanticpowers into a working system, and even Russia seemed about tobe dragged into a combine of intelligent equilibrium based on anintelligent allotment of activities. For the first time in fifteen hun-dred years a true Roman pax was in sight, and would, if it suc-ceeded, owe its virtues to him. Except for making peace in Man-churia, he could do no more; and if the worst should happen, settingcontinent against continent in arms — the only apparent alterna-tive to his scheme — he need not repine at missing the catastrophe.This rosy view served to soothe disgusts which every partingstatesman feels, and commonly with reason. One had no need toget out one's notebook in order to jot down the exact figures on504The Education of Henry Adamseither side. Why add up the elements of resistance and anarchy?The Kaiser supplied him with these figures, just as the Creticapproached Morocco. Every one was doing it, and seemed in apanic about it. The chaos waited only for his landing.Arrived at Genoa, the party hid itself for a fortnight at Nervi,and he gained strength rapidly as long as he made no effort andheard no call for action. Then they all went on to Nauheim with-out relapse. There, after a few days, Adams left him for the regulartreatment, and came up to Paris. The medical reports promisedwell, and Hay's letters were as humorous and light-handed as ever.To the last he wrote cheerfully of his progress, and amusinglywith his usual light scepticism, of his various doctors; but whenthe treatment ended, three weeks later, and he came on to Paris,he showed, at the first glance, that he had lost strength, and thereturn to affairs and interviews wore him rapidly out. He wasconscious of it, and in his last talk before starting for London andLiverpool he took the end of his activity for granted. "You musthold out for the peace negotiations," was the remonstrance. "I Venot time ! " he replied. "You '11 need little time ! " was the rejoinder.Each was correct.There it ended! Shakespeare himself could use no more thanthe commonplace to express what is incapable of expression. "Therest is silence!" The few familiar words, among the simplest in thelanguage, conveying an idea trite beyond rivalry, served Shake-speare, and, as yet, no one has said more. A few weeks afterwards,one warm evening in early July, as Adams was strolling down todine under the trees at Armenonville, he learned that Hay wasdead. He expected it; on Hay's account, he was even satisfied tohave his friend die, as we would all die if we could, in full fame, athome and abroad, universally regretted, and wielding his powerto the last. One had seen scores of emperors and heroes fade intocheap obscurity even when alive; and now, at least, one had notthat to fear for one's friend. It was not even the suddenness of theshock, or the sense of void, that threw Adams into the depths ofNunc Age505Hamlet's Shakespearean silence in the full flare of Paris frivolityin its favorite haunt where worldly vanity reached its most futileclimax in human history; it was only the quiet summons to follow— the assent to dismissal. It was time to go. The three friends hadbegun life together; and the last of the three had no motive — noattraction — to carry it on after the others had gone. Educationhad ended for all three, and only beyond some remoter horizoncould its values be fixed or renewed. Perhaps some day — say1938, their centenary — they might be allowed to return togetherfor a holiday, to see the mistakes of their own lives made clear inthe light of the mistakes of their successors; and perhaps then, forthe first time since man began his education among the carnivores,they would find a world that sensitive and timid natures couldregard without a shudder.THE ENDINDEXINDEXAcceleration, law, 489.Adams, Abigail, 353; on Catherine John-son, 17.Adams, Abigail Brown (Brooks), 23; onEnglish influence, 211.Adams, Brooks, 360, 464; at Harvard Col-lege, 299; on exchanges, 338.25;Adams, Charles Francis, 48, 149; takento Russia, 18; in Boston, 19; marriage,and children, 23; and State Street, 24;nominated Vice-President,slavepower, 26; opinion of sons, 26; isolation,27; political party, 29; reading, 35; fam-ily, 36; senatorship agreement, 49; onEurope, 70; in Congress, 88, 101; com-pared with Seward, 104;minister toEngland, no; equipment, 112; impas-siveness, 115; social position, 16, 132,194, 212; Trent affair, 119; trusts Rus-sell, 136, 149; clash with Palmerston,136; rebel cruisers, 150, 167; interviewwith Russell,168;strength of, 208; proposed return toAmerica, 209; collects coins, 213; likingfor Washington, 269.rebel rams,158;Adams, Charles Francis (1835-1915), 23,41, 89, 120; at Fort Independence, 112;remonstrates, 129; after the war, 210,241; railroad studies, 240, 307; gold con-spiracy, 270; favors professorship, 293.Adams, Evelyn (Davis), 442.Adams, Henry [Brooks], birth, 3, 23; earlyexperiences, 5; encounter with J.
