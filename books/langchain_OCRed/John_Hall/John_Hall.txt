REVELL  COMPANY(NOVEMBER)TO  MY  MOTHERWHOSE  EAGER   LOVE  LIGHTENEDAT   EVERY   STEPTHE  LIFE  OF  HIM  WHOM  THESE  PAGESWOULD   FAIN   PORTRAY,AND   FROM   WHOM   NOT   EVEN   DEATH   DIVIDESTHIS  VOLUME  IS  AFFECTIONATELY   DEDICATEDBY  HER  SON.PrefaceIT  has  been  a  labor  of  filial  love  to  trace  the  lifeof  one  who  left  his  mark  for  good  uponthousands  of  lives.  The  born  preacher  foregoesa  measure  of  literary  fame  as  he  speaks  to  theimmediate  needs  of  men,  not  in  the  forms  thatmight  make  him  acceptable  to  the  chosen  few,but  in  the  modes  understood  of  the  many.  Myfather  was  himself  averse  to  printing  his  sermons.He  has  left  but  few  in  such  a  form  that  theycould  be  given  to  the  press,  and  those  would,  Ifear,  misrepresent  him  to  those  who  never  heardhis  voice  or  knew  the  charm  that  separates  theborn  preacher  from  the  pulpit  speaker  or  eventhe  platform  orator.  He  gave  his  life  for  hisgeneration.  He  sought  no  reputation  as  either  atheologian  or  man  of  letters.  Indeed  he  deliberately  turned  away  from  work  great  gifts  fittedhim  to  do,  for  that  which  he  deemed  more  important;  the  calling  of  men  to  life  eternal  inChrist  Jesus  our  Lord.  The  purpose  of  thesepages  is  to  prolong  a  little  the  savor  of  his  mem-78  PREFACEory;  to  interpret,  however  weakly,  the  sincerityand  singleness  of  aim  that  marked  the  man,  to  ageneration  that  needs  inspiration  to  simplicity;to  remind  friends  of  what  we  all  have  lost,  andperhaps,  to  help  some  one  seeking  to  live  thelife  of  sacrifice  and  devotion  how  to  makethat  life  more  widely  useful.  The  filial  relationforbids  alike  eulogium  and  critique.  No  powersat  the  command  of  the  author  can  do  justice  tothe  straightforward,  tender,  upright  manhoodthat  made  my  father  a  tower  of  strength  to  everycause  he  made  his  own,  and  a  sheltering  rock  tomany  weaker  ones  battling  with  untoward  circumstances.  In  him  strength  and  gentlenessmingled  in  an  indescribably  attractive  way.  Hewas  personally  unspoilt  by  success,  and  the  lasttests  of  his  character  though  they  broke  his  heart,left  him  without  bitterness,  humbly  and  simplyleaning  on  that  Father's  strength,  whose  way  isnot  our  way,  but  whose  love  guarded  His  servantunto  the  end.  With  no  one  did  my  father  probably  speak  more  intimately  on  many  subjectsconnected  with  his  life  and  work  than  with  thewriter.  The  loving  confidences  of  a  commoncalling  were  unbroken  to  the  end.  During  theweakness  and  ill-health  at  Buxton  (England)memory  naturally  with  him  went  back  to  earlyPREFACE  9days,  and  sitting  in  the  gardens  or  driving  out  onthe  high  uplands  he  told  me  many  things  thatwill  always  remain  with  me  as  vivid  impressionsof  his  hopes  and  aims.  His  life  was  no  complexproblem  to  be  slowly  explained  amidst  doubtsand  guesses  as  to  the  deeper  meaning.  His  aimwas  as  direct  as  it  was  high.  He  felt  himself  tobe  an  ambassador  for  Christ  beseeching  men  tobe  reconciled  unto  God.  May  this  sketch  of  hislife  and  work  prolong  for  a  little  the  tendermemories  of  his  loving  plea.THOMAS  C.  HALL,  D.

THE  FAMILY  HOME.  EARLYTRAINING.  SCHOOL  LIFE.  THE  OLD  MEETING-HOUSE.  EAR-LIEST  MEMORIES.  CHRISTIAN  EXPERIENCE.THE  Province  of  Ulster  lacks  some  of  thepicturesque  features  that  mark  the  southernand  western  parts  of  Ireland,  nor  is  its  soil  themost  fertile,  yet  a  sturdy  race  has  made  it  by  farthe  most  prosperous  and  contented  portion  ofthe  Island.  This  northern  section  of  the  countrywas  settled  by  Scotch  and  north  of  EnglandProtestants  to  whom  King  James  gave  the  landthus  hoping  to  secure  loyal  support  against  theturbulent  Roman  Catholic  opposition.  l  Amongthe  Scotch  settlers  there  went  some  of  the  familyof  Hall.  The  Scotch  home  is  said  to  be  still  inthe  hands  of  the  older  branch  of  the  family.All  the  descendants  remained  true  to  the  oldScotch  traditions,  and  the  environment  in  whichthe  subject  of  this  memoir  grew  up  was  thusstoutly  Protestant  and  Presbyterian.  He  was  theeldest  son  of  William  Hall  and  Rachel  McGowan.For  six  generations  the  family  had  maintained1  Cf.  Prendergast's  "  Irish  Settlement."22  BOYHOOD  DAYSpossession  of  Ballygorman,  County  Armagh,where  my  father  was  born  on  the  3ist  of  July,1829.  He  was  baptized  in  the  same  year  onOctober  i3th,  by  his  mother's  cousin  the  Rev.William  McGowan.  There  came  eight1  otherchildren,  all  save  three  still  living.  Two  littlegirls  died  in  childhood,  and  one  brother  RobertGillis,  only  survived  his  brother  by  about  a  yearand  a  half.  The  three  sisters  still  remain  in  thehome  country,  but  all  the  brothers  either  precededor  followed  their  eldest  brother  to  America.It  is  not  difficult  for  any  one,  at  all  familiar  withthe  north  of  Ireland  to  form  some  picture  of  thesimple  home  in  which  the  family  grew  up.  Thelittle  cottage  still  stands  in  the  midst  of  thefields.  A  narrow  lane  bordered  by  thorn  hedgesleads  up  to  the  doorway.  The  softly  rollingcountry  is  dotted  by  hundreds  of  other  cottagesnot  much  varied  in  size  and  appearance.  Allneatly  whitewashed,  and  now  rather  stifflyproud  of  slate  roofs;  these  being  an  innovation.Part  of  the  beauty  of  the  countryside  in  theearly  days  were  the  thatched  roofs  under  whichthe  birds  built  their  nests,  and  twittered  a  noisywelcome  to  the  early  risers.  Under  a  thatch1  Robert  G.,  Hannah,  Elizabeth,  Sarah  Jane,  James,  Mary,Mary  Hall,  Samuel  M.BOYHOOD  DAYS  23roof  William  Hall  brought  up  his  family.  Hewas  a  man  of  high  standing  and  wide  influencein  his  community.  He  was  an  elder  in  theChurch,  and  with  him  the  position  was  one  ofsolemn  responsibility.  He  seems  also  to  havebeen  a  much  sought  counsellor  in  the  affairs  ofthe  community  and  to  have  enjoyed  a  wideacquaintance  and  high  respect.Wealth  he  did  not  have.  A  large  family  andimpaired  health  shadowed  his  later  days  withnatural  anxieties.  Moreover  the  defalcation  of  afellow  trustee  for  a  ward  placed  in  their  jointcharge  by  the  courts  greatly  harassed  him.William  Hall  at  once  assumed  the  full  responsibility  of  making  good  the  loss.  This  sum  was  alarge  one  for  those  days  and  circumstances;  andalthough  he  carried  out  his  resolution  with  unswerving  fidelity  the  effort  must  have  contributed,  his  children  always  thought,  to  the  shortening  of  his  days.  It  was  his  ambition  to  give  allhis  boys  the  education  so  eagerly  coveted  alike  inthe  north  of  Ireland  as  in  Scotland  by  Protestantparents  for  their  sons.  Very  early,  therefore,  theeldest  boy  was  started  on  the  highroad  of  learning  at  the  little  neighborhood  school  kept  by  a  Mr.Wm.  Whitten  at  Lough  gilly.  My  father  has  leftthe  following  little  sketch  of  that  early  day:24  BOYHOOD  DAYS"Probably  a  village  school  in  Ulster,  Ireland'smost  prosperous  province,  would  be  less  impressive  to  the  adult  mind  than  is  a  well-orderedWard  school  in  New  York;  but  to  the  presentwriter,  at  the  age  of  five,  or  a  little  more,  nothingearthly  could  possibly  be  more  solemn  than  thecountry  school,  the  day  he  was  introduced.  Heremembers  the  appalling  hum  as  he  approached,the  awful  introduction  to  "the  master,"  themasked  battery  of  strange  and  scrutinizing  eyes,and  the  agony  of  suspense  in  which  he  sat  andwatched  the  retreating  friendly  form  that  hadsheltered  him  till  then,  wondering  what  wouldnow  be  done  to  him!  With  some  such  feelings,possibly,  the  Androcles  whose  acquaintance  wasmade  afterwards,  awaited  the  approach  of  the  lion."  And  the  lion  became  quite  tame  and  like  Androcles,  even  kind.  This  teacher  had  only  aparish  school,  one  of  that  sort  of  which  it  wasplayfully  said  that  the  pupils  mainly  learned  thecatechism,  and  to  take  off  their  hats  to  the  squire.But  this  man  was  a  true  teacher,  and  a  gentleman— he  is  now  a  good  clergyman  in  Canada — andif  for  no  other  reason,  the  present  writer,  inmemory  of  him,  will  revere  the  calling  of  theteacher,  and  claim  respect  for  the  class  as  long  ashe  lives."BOYHOOD  DAYS  25The  more  modern  methods  of  learning  withoutwork  were  not  then  in  vogue.  The  early  drill,however,  insured  fair  spelling  and  some  knowledge  of  the  English  grammar.  The  much-thumbed  spelling-book  still  exists,  which  waslearned  by  heart  from  end  to  end,  definitions  andall.  When  that  had  been  exhausted  a  shortdictionary  took  its  place,  and  was  similarly  mastered.  At  a  very  early  age  the  handwriting  oflittle  John  was  formed,  and  by  its  regularity  andbeauty  became  the  pride  of  a  large  family  circle.So  much  indeed  was  this  the  case,  that  in  theevening  the  younger  children  of  the  family  andthe  neighbors  round  about  were  gathered  in  thekitchen  of  the  farmhouse,  and  this,  as  thelargest  room  obtainable,  was  made  into  a  night-schoolroom  with  the  eldest  boy  as  teacher  underthe  general  superintendence  of  the  parents.Any  true  picture  of  the  family  life  of  thosedays  would  imply  almost  poverty  to  those  accustomed  to  greater  luxury.  The  daily  fare  wasof  the  simplest  character.  The  products  of  thefarm  being  almost  wholly  relied  upon  to  supplythe  table.  Fresh  meat  was  not  freely  eaten.  Inthe  evening  those  who  had  worked  in  the  fieldsgathered  about  the  turf  fire  in  the  kitchenand  over  it  hung  a  huge  pot  of  oatmeal  boiled26  BOYHOOD  DAYSwith  the  buttermilk  from  the  dairy.  This  withoat-cakes  formed  the  principal  food  of  the  wholecountryside.  Money  was  very  scarce.  Thefarm  methods  were  exceedingly  primitive,  andthe  lack  of  coal  and  capital  made  any  changesdifficult  and  often  unprofitable.  Even  the  clothing  was  largely  home-made  and  constructed  witha  view  rather  to  endurance  than  to  fashion.  Yetfor  all  this,  enforced  simplicity  was  not  felt  aspoverty.  Nowhere  in  the  world  can  there  befound  to  this  day,  a  prouder  independence  thanamong  the  self-sustaining  Ulster  farmers.When  it  became  apparent  that  the  capacity  ofthe  oldest  son  easily  warranted  the  ambition  of  acollege  education,  William  Hall  took  up  bravelythe  burden  of  making  due  preparation  for  thisstep.  Mr.  Whitten  left  soon  for  other  parts,  andhis  successor  then  confessed  not  long  after  thathe  could  do  no  more  for  the  boy.  Some  threemiles  from  Ballygorman  a  man  of  good  parts  hadestablished  a  classical  school.  The  father  at  firsttook  lodgings  for  his  son  near  the  school,  butthis  plan  was  found  to  be  inconvenient;  then  theboy,  already  tall  for  his  age,  walked  with  hisschool-books  flung  over  his  shoulder  in  a  greenbag.  The  walk  was,  however,  too  much  for  thegrowing  lad,  and  the  father  bought  him  a  pony.BOYHOOD  DAYS  27To  the  end  of  his  days  he  carried  the  scar  causedby  the  pony  throwing  him  against  a  mile-stoneon  the  roadside.The  classical  drill  was  narrow  in  range,  butsound  and  thorough.     The  Latin  of  those  dayswas    never    forgotten.     And    all    through    myfather's  life  he  had  the  habit  of  writing  little  exclamatory  prayers  in  the  Latin  tongue  in  his  notebooks  or  at  the  close  of  sermons  and  addresses.The  growing  mind  of  a  rather  sober  boy   wasnow  stimulated  by  the  sense  of  increasing  responsibility.     For  the  health  of  the  father  begannow    to    fail   steadily.      Towards  eventide  theparent  would  take  his  eldest  son  by  the  hand,and  with  him  would  go  out  to  the  little  orchardbehind  the  cottage,   and  there  overlooking  the"far  land"  in  the  glow  of  the  closing  day,  hewould  commune  with  God;  and  he  himself  prematurely    bent    with     hard    toil,    anxiety    andcare,  would  impress  on  the  boy's  mind  lessonshe  never  forgot  of  fidelity  to  duty,  obedience  toGod,  dependence  upon  prayer,  and  of  faithfulness  in   all   undertaken   tasks.     Even  then  theboy's  mind  was  filled  with  awe  and  hope  at  theprospect   of   undertaking  the  public  ministry  ofGod's  word.     When  the  minister  came,  as  wasthe  wholesome  custom,  and  gathered  about  him28  BOYHOOD  DAYSall  the  children  to  question  and  instruct  them  inreligious  matters,  the  eldest  boy  was  alwaysforemost  in  the  accuracy  of  the  answering.  EachSabbath  the  family  made  the  way  "across  thebogs  "  if  fine,  along  the  roadway  in  wet  or  winter  weather  to  the  "meeting-house."  Of  thismy  father  has  left  a  description.1"  High  trees  shade  the  place.  Decent  gravestones,  neat  walks,  beech  hedges,  and  a  high,strong  wall  dividing  all  from  the  main  street —the  one  street  of  the  village — give  the  place  theair  of  a  venerable  and  honored  institution  wherethe  living  worship,  and  where  the  dead  repose.In  the  centre  of  the  inclosure,  along  one  side  ofwhich  flows  a  rivulet  through  what  was  once  aglen,  rises  the  main  building,  solid  in  structure  ifnot  artistic  in  shape,  and  approached  by  a  fittinggate,  stone  stairs  and  wide  and  sanded  avenue,with  the  graves  of  the  people  right  and  left  of  it.You  may  walk  straight  up  the  aisle,  with  thepulpit  on  your  left  and  out  at  the  correspondingdoor,  when  another  wide  walk,  similarly  surrounded,  takes  you  to  the  '  retiring-room.'  Closeby  this  retiring-room  are  the  tombs  of  the  ministers  who  lived  and  died  among  the  people,  and1  In  the  New  York  Ledger,  the  owners  of  which  have  givengenerous  permission  to  reprint  any  material  found  useful.BOYHOOD  DAYS  29over  whose  graves  substantial  monuments,  withfitting  inscriptions,  invite  the  attention  and  veneration  of  all  comers,  and  are  read  and  re-read  inthe  warm  summer  days,  when  the  people  are'waiting  for  the  minister  to  go  in.'  Where'fifty  years  of  faithful  service'  are  credited  to  apastor  whose  remains  sleep  there— wife  andseveral  children  beside  him— it  is  not  to  be  wondered  at  if  the  name  is  repeated  with  tenderness,and  held  in  veneration."It  is  more  than  fifty  years  since  the  presentwriter  was  taken  as  a  child  to  that  '  meetinghouse.'  The  minister  was,  to  him,  old,  for  achild  counts  any  one  old  whose  hair  is  turninggray,  but  he  was  remarkably  kindly;  and  thekindness  was  all  the  more  touching  from  thegravity  of  his  bearing,  and  the  dignity  of  hiswalk.  I  am  not  sure  that  all  that  he  preachedwas  understood,  but  it  was  all  so  solemn,  tender,and  suggestive  of  Deity  and  eternity,  and  the  attention  of  the  people  was  so  reverent,  that  it  wasimpossible  to  be  inattentive.  Much  is  said  nowadays  about  making  the  churches  attractive  tothe  young,  and  the  effort  often  leads  in  the  direction  of  competition  with  popular  institutions  thatthrive  by  the  number  of  tickets  they  can  sell.The  writer  may  be  mistaken,  but  all  his  recollec-30  BOYHOOD  DAYStions  would  indicate  that  to  make  the  church  andits  service  solemn,  tender,  true  to  the  facts  oflife,  real,  sincere,  and  not  a  show  of  things  notrendered  real  to  the  young  mind,  is  the  best  wayto  make  it  revered  and  beloved  by  those  whohave  not  yet  been  demoralized  by  '  spectacles  'and  palpable  insincerities."Fifty  years  ago  the  floors  were  earthen,  except  the  great  double  pews  at  each  end,  whichwere  ascended  by  a  couple  of  steps,  of  coursewith  a  boarded  floor  and  a  wooden  cover,  likethe  venerable  four-poster  beds  of  the  past  generation.  In  one  of  these  it  was  the  writer's  privilegeto  sit  and,  while  singing  was  going  on,  to  gazewith  admiration  at  the  huge  beams  stretchedfrom  wall  to  wall,  and  on  which  rested  the  '  uprights  '  that  held  up  the  roof,  for  ceiling  thebuilding  had  none.  On  the  angle  made  by  thewalls  of  two  converging  aisles  stood  the  pulpit,high,  narrow,  with  a  roof  over  it  with  no  visiblesupport,  and  below  it,  a  smaller  one  for  the  precentor,  whose  duty  it  was  to  give  out  each  lineof  the  psalm,  sing  it,  or  rather  lead  in  the  singingof  it,  and  then  give  the  next,  and  so  on.  Thesearrangements  can  be  so  described  as  to  provokea  smile,  but  they  were  on  the  line  of  the  life  ofthe  people;  they  were  of  a  piece  with  the  waysBOYHOOD  DAYS  31of  other  churches,  and  they  were  not  incompatible  with  solemnity  any  more  than  with  decency.1  can  well  remember  the  Communion  Sabbath —the  long  tables,  covered  with  the  white  linen,stretching  all  the  length  of  the  aisles,  and  thepeople,  psalm-books  in  hand,  slowly  and  withthe  most  devout  bearing,  moving  out  of  theirpews  to  their  places,  singing  as  they  went:1  I'll  of  salvation  take  the  cup,On  God's  name  will  I  call;I'll  pay  my  vows  now  to  the  LordBefore  His  people  all.'I  have  seen  stately  processions  in  historic  cathedrals,  and  still  more  moving  spectacles  of  thousands  starting  to  their  feet  under  one  impulse,but  never  anything  more  like  reverent  acknowledgment  of  the  Divine  than  then  appeared  inthe  old  meeting-house."Thus  he  grew  up  a  tall  thin  lad,  not  then  possessing  the  muscular  vigor  he  afterwards  developed,  but  with  good  health,  and  an  enviedreputation  among  his  playmates  for  good  temper,and  although  not  strong  yet  quick  and  agile.Indeed  at  jumping  he  was  long  preeminent  bothat  school  and  later  at  Belfast.Narrow  means  lose  much  of  their  terror  whenthey  are  not  contrasted  with  luxury,  and  do  not32  BOYHOOD  DAYSplace  us  in  the  power  of  others.  The  strugglewith  nature  was  hard  for  all  alike.  Manly  independence  was  possible  even  to  the  poor.  Thriftand  daily  toil  entailed  neither  personal  degradation  nor  loss  of  social  standing.  Work  was  thenormal  occupation  of  all.  Even  as  a  young  boymy  father  had  helped  to  earn  his  school  fees  bygiving  lessons  to  those  less  advanced.  When,therefore,  it  was  decided  that  he  should  go  to  Belfast  and  prepare  himself  for  the  ministry,  he  lookedforward,  as  did  practically  all  his  fellow-students,to  helping  himself  through  the  course  by  teaching,  prize-taking,  and  in  other  legitimate  ways.There  was  a  growing  family  to  consider,  andlittle  sisters  and  brothers  made  the  utmost  economy  necessary.The  atmosphere  of  the  home  was  in  the  bestsense  of  that  word  religious.  At  the  same  timeintellectual  influences  were  not  lacking.  WilliamHall,  my  grandfather,  must  have  been  a  man  ofconsiderable  intellectual  force.  Even  whilewalking  with  the  plough  he  would  tell  his  boystories  from  the  Greek  and  Roman  classics  whichhe  had  gathered  from  well-used  translations,  andearly  he  instilled  into  his  son's  mind  a  love  forgood  English  verse.  Years  afterwards  my  fathercould  repeat  poems  he  had  so  learned,  and  heBOYHOOD  DAYS  33never  quite  gave  up  the  practice  of  from  time  totime  learning  verse.  The  simple  easy  rhythm  ofhis  pulpit  style  was,  no  doubt,  in  good  part  aproduct  of  this  training.When  John  Hall  went  away  to  complete  hiseducation  he  carried  with  him,  as  he  did  throughall  his  life  the  savor  and  fragrance  of  pious  love.There  were  in  those  days  in  Ireland  no  committees  to  grant  money  to  any  boy  who  inducedhis  presbytery  to  give  him  a  good  character  andwho  wanted  to  study  at  the  expense  of  thechurch  at  large.  There  were,  however,  prizesand  places  that  scholarship  gave  a  claim  upon.And  although  very  young  and  by  no  meansstrong  all  the  teachers  were  agreed  that  WilliamHall's  eldest  son  should  certainly  go  to  Belfastand  prepare  for  the  ministry.  The  last  penny  ofthe  sum  spent  by  the  unfaithful  trustee  had  atlength  been  paid,  and  the  prospects  of  the  familylooked  brighter.  The  classical  school  had  beenpretty  well  exhausted  by  the  diligence  of  thepupil  and  so  at  a  very  early  age  it  seemed  best  tosend  the  youth  to  Belfast.It  was  a  simple  boyhood,  filled  with  work,  andwith,  perhaps,  a  minimum  of  play.  Yet  withalthat  childhood  was  always  looked  back  to  withtender  memories  of  its  joys,  and  a  deep  and  rev-34  BOYHOOD  DAYSerent  love  for  all  the  simple  associations,  andgentle  influences  of  the  home.  Of  that  childhood  my  father  published  himself  some  memories  in  the  Evangelical  Witness  under  thedate  1861.  He  was  at  that  time  himself  theeditor,  so  the  impressions  were  not  signed  byhim,  but  given  under  the  heading  "I  remember,"by  "An  Old  Boy."  Some  extracts  are  as  follows:"I  remember  the  first  conscious  impression  Ihad  of  beauty.  I  think  it  almost  as  distinct  arecollection  as  I  have.  It  was  a  summer  afternoon:  we  lived  in  the  country,  and  in  a  house  ofno  particular  pretensions.  It  had  trees  about  it,many  of  them  sycamores,  in  which  the  wild  beeswere  keeping  up  a  pleasant  hum.  My  brother —he  was  younger  than  I — and  myself  were  playingin  front  of  the  house,  when  my  mother  raisedthe  window,  and  calling  us,  handed  each  somebread  and  honey,  with  some  kindly  word — I  forget  what.  I  think  our  pleasure  pleased  her,  forher  face  beamed  as  it  had  never  beamed  to  mebefore,  and  for  the  first  time  I  was  distinctlyconscious  that  my  mother  was  beautiful!  It  hada  great  effect  on  me.  My  mother  was  alwaysgood  to  me,  and  I  revered  her,  but  now  I  had  anew  feeling  towards  her.  She  was  like  an  angelBOYHOOD  DAYS  35to  me  now.  Ah,  mother!  long  years  have  gonesince  then.  On  that  face,  there  has  been  many  atear,  tears  over  the  little  dead  bodies,  tears  overtheir  father's  coffin,  tears,  no  doubt,  over  me,and  that  face  is  changed  to  all  others.  I  keep  inmy  heart  the  photograph  that  was  taken  of  itthat  summer  afternoon,  long,  long  ago,  and  Ithink,  like  that  will  be  my  mother's  face  to  mein  heaven."  I  remember  the  first  real  cry  I  ever,  with  myheart,  sent  up  to  God.  Do  not  tell  me  that  children  have  no  troubles.  Do  not  think  because  thetears  soon  give  place  to  laughter  they  did  not  comefrom  sorrow.  I  had  early  troubles,  for  therewere  tyrants— cruel  and  wanton  tyrants  of  eight,nine  and  ten  years  of  age,  at  school  with  me.The  teacher  closed  it  with  prayer— a  good  custom,— and  I  prayed.  Prayers  wrung  from  us  byfear,  I  know,  are  not  the  best,  but  they  are  betterthan  none,  and  I  prayed  them.  My  childish  heartdid  actually  ask  God  to  save  me  from  my  tormentors.  Oh,  boys  and  girls!  do  not  make  anychild's  life  bitter  at  school.  He  may  cry  to  Godagainst  you,  and  God  may  hear  and  avenge  him.*****"  I  remember  the  first  deep  remorse  I  ever  had.It  was  a  dreary  winter  day,  and  I  do  not  remem-36  BOYHOOD  DAYSber  how  it  came  about,  but  a  poor  wretched  dogcame  into  our  hands,  and  I  and  another  boy  madesorry  sport  for  ourselves  by  throwing  the  creatureinto  the  water,  pelting  it  with  stones,  and  whenit  sweltered  to  the  bank,  pushing  it  in  again.  Inone  of  its  attempts  to  get  out,  I  bent  down  tohurl  it  back,  when  the  creature  turned  its  eye  onme  with  such  a  look  of  entreaty  and  reproach —such  an  appealing,  deprecating  look!  It  went  tomy  heart.  I  could  not  touch  it  again.  I  wondered  how  my  playmate  could.  I  saved  it  fromhis  hands,  but  I  was  too  much  of  a  coward  totell  him  why.  Oh,  I  shall  never  forget  that  lookfrom  the  dumb,  helpless,  suffering  animal.  It  mayseem  profane  to  say  it  here,  but  I  know  the  forceof  'Jesus  turned  and  looked  upon  Peter.'  Manya  time  I  have  felt  remorse  since  then,  but  I  doubtif  ever  it  was  more  poignant  than  under  the  eyeof  that  poor  dog."  I  remember  the  first  falsehood.  My  father  hadtaken  pains  to  teach  me  a  lesson  one  evening,  andhe  inquired  particularly  the  next,  was  I  not  bestin  my  class  ?  It  was  too  much  for  me.  I  saidyes,  and  felt  degraded  and  condemned.  Unconsciously  he  tempted  me,  but  I  should  not  havegiven  way.  And  now  I  am  older,  I  doubt  ifparents  are  wise  when  they  inquire  too  minutelyBOYHOOD  DAYS  37about  the  sayings  and  doings  of  their  young  ones,from  themselves.  Our  school,  I  am  sure,  wasnot  a  wonderful  school  in  any  way.  You  mightsee  the  boys  and  girls  on  a  November  morning,when  the  hoarfrost  whitened  the  crisp  grass,tripping  along  with  little  red  hands,  and  shiningfaces,  with  a  book  or  two  under  one  arm  and  '  aturf  (of  peat)  under  the  other,  which,  on  entering  the  school,  was  added  to  the  heap  thatwarmed  the  house  for  the  day.  And  yet,  simpleand  primitive  as  it  was,  we  had  the  usual  variety  of  character,  and  I  think,  speaking  generally,those  whom  I  know  now,  are  very  much  in  maturity,  what  they  were  beginning  to  be  as  children."I  remember  the  first  lively  impression  I  had  ofnatural  beauty.  I  had  gone  to  another  school,from  which  I  was  returning  through  the  field.  Itwas  the  end  of  March,  and  a  sunny  afternoon.Descending  a  gentle  incline  towards  a  littlestream,  I  stepped  on  the  mound  that  rose  aboveit  on  one  side,  to  jump  over  it  to  the  lower  bankon  the  other.  I  paused  before  leaping.  Thewater  was  clear,  showing  the  smooth  pebblesunderneath  it,  and  the  sunbeams  glinting  off  themthrough  the  little  eddies.  The  wild  plants  on  themargin  were  coming  out,  and  the  moss  and  water38  BOYHOOD  DAYSherbage  had  a  cheerful  tint  of  green,  and  all  wasso  calm,  so  clear,  so  harmonious,  so  suggestiveof — not  thoughts  but  feelings — pleasant  yet  somehow  pensive — as  to  seem  almost  intelligent.  Itwas  long  before  I  made  my  leap,  and  went  onmy  way.  I  have  seen  many  things  since, —mountain,  glen  and  flood,  but  did  I  ever  taste  apurer  joy  from  these  than  when  I  discovered  thatnew  delight  ?*****"  I  remember  the  first  death  I  saw.  When  I  wasleaving  home  one  morning  for  school,  mother'sface  was  more  than  commonly  pale.  She  hadbeen  up  all  night,  and  on  her  knee  lay  the  causeof  her  wakefulness.  Poor  baby  was  ill — shefeared,  dying.  Her  little  bosom  heaved — even  Icould  see — too  much,  and  her  little  placid  facehad  a  look  of  languor  as  she  lay  with  the  headthrown  back  on  her  mother's  arms.  Mothermade  me  kiss  the  baby  particularly; — her  heart,  Iknew,  would  fain  have  kept  me  at  home,  butwhat  could  I  do  ?  I  went  to  school.  When  Icame  home  the  house  was  more  than  usually  still,without  and  within.  There  was  a  hushed  solemnity  over  all,  and  I  saw  the  little  baby  face,  thestillness  of  death  on  it,  and  the  little  curls  drawnout  from  the  small  white  cap,  and  falling  on  theBOYHOOD  DAYS  39baby  brow,  and  mother  sat  looking  at  the  closedeyes,  and  hair,  and  little  fingers,  oh,  with  whata  terrible,  still  grief!  That  was  the  first  deaththat  came  near  me,  and  1  had  far  more  thoughtabout  it  than  children  are  supposed  to  have.  Iused  to  stand  with  my  mother,  when  we  went  to'  meeting  ' — we  went  a  little  earlier  often  thanthe  people — by  the  little  grassy  grave  where  babylay,  and  I  knew  my  mother  was  thinking  of  herlittle  one,  'now'  she  said,  'like  an  angel  inheaven.'  I  know  now  what  mother  then  felt.*****"I  remember  when  I  first  went  to  Sabbath-school.  It  was  a  union  school,  the  curate  and  thecountry  being  joined  in  its  management,  and  wherelittle,  stout  red-leather  Psalm-books,  with  clasps,were  coveted  prizes  among  the  children,  beforethey  were  big  enough  to  earn  Bibles.  When  theydid  earn  them  by  giving  in  ever  so  many  tickets,each  representing  a  Sunday  at  school,  and  so  manyverses  learned  '  by  heart  '  what  honest  pride  theyfelt!  You  might  see  the  happy  little  maidenwith  her  Bible  in  the  folded  pocket  handkerchief,with  a  sprig  of  '  sither-wood  ' — that  fragrant  (?)plant  which  the  Scottish  settlers  brought  withthem— or  mayhap  a  full-blown  rose  gracing  theexposed  top  of  the  precious  book,  blithely40  BOYHOOD  DAYStripping  to  'meeting'  with  father  or  mother.Ah,  me!  these  simple  luxuries  are  giving  placeto  French  gold  and  fashionable  'gauntlets,'but  we  do  not  complain.  The  world  moves,and  we  believe  Ulster  has  never  had  as  manyBible-loving  maidens  as  at  this  moment.  Bysuch  as  these,  one  of  them  is  in  heaven  now,I  think, — I  was  conducted  to  the  Sabbath-school.  There  was  much  learning  of  texts,and  exercise  of  the  memory.  There  was  littleexercise  of  the  judgment  and  no  appeal  tothe  heart.  The  school  did  good,  for  it  formedgood  habits,  familiarized  the  mind  with  the  wordsof  the  Scriptures;  but  it  did  far  less  good  thanit  might,  had  there  been  teachers  fit  to  teach."  I  remember  reading  seven  chapters  of  Deuteronomy  in  a  morning  in  that  school.  On — on—on  we  went  without  note  or  comment.  Nowthat  I  am  older  I  see  the  need  of  training  teachersif  we  are  to  get  good  from  our  Sunday-schools,and  I  am  thankful,  and  I  hope  so  are  my  readers,that  we  have  so  many  to  teach,  speaking  whatthey  know,  and  inviting  to  a  Saviour  whom  theyhave  found  themselves."The  influences  of  that  Christian  home  werealways  emphasized  by  my  father.  He  felt  thatsuch  surroundings  made  a  vast  difference  in  judg-BOYHOOD  DAYS  41ing  of  a  life.  He  went  himself  naturally  into  allthe  full  duties  of  the  Christian  profession,  havingbeen  baptized  into  the  Church  as  a  child.  In  reply  to  an  inquisitive  editor,  he  once  wrote:"  In  reply  to  your  inquiries  I  have  to  say,  withprofound  gratitude  to  God,  that  I  was  broughtup  in  the  closest  connection  with  the  church,learned  the  '  Shorter  Catechism  '  in  my  home,attended  Sabbath-school,  and,  I  think,  believedin  the  Saviour  for  years  before  becoming  a  communicant.  This  step  I  was  permitted  to  take  atthe  age  of  fourteen,  after  passing  through  thecommunicants'  class  of  a  faithful  pastor."In  this  home  the  vacations  away  from  collegewere  always  spent.  And  to  the  school  whencehe  had  gone  to  college  he  returned  to  assist  during  his  leisure  time.  He  also  aided  his  father  onthe  farm  as  much  as  he  was  able  to,  and  while  athome  made  himself  useful  by  teaching  theyounger  children.  His  sisters  say  they  rememberthe  delight  with  which  he  was  always  welcomedback  from  Belfast,  and  to  him  they  always  lookedalmost  more  as  a  father  than  a  brother  in  lateryears.II.

THEEVANGELICAL  INFL  UENCES.  HIS  FA  THER'S  DEA  TH.  THE  CON-NAUGHT  PROPOSALS.IT  was  at  an  exceedingly  early  age  even  in  thosedays  that  the  name  of  John  Hall  was  inscribed  on  the  books  of  the  College  at  Belfast.He  began  his  work  there  with  the  autumn  sessionof  1841,  and  was  therefore  just  beginning  histhirteenth  year.  It  is  of  no  little  importance  toform  some  estimate  of  the  religious  and  intellectual  atmosphere  from  which  the  boy  wentand  into  which  he  entered.  Ireland  was  feelingthe  full  force  of  the  evangelical  movement.What  Dr.  Chalmers  was  in  his  way  doing  forScotland  Dr.  Henry  Cooke  was  accomplishingfor  Ireland.  The  home  in  Ballygorman  had  feltthe  impulses  of  a  newly  awakened  religious  life.The  type  of  personal  piety  which  was  one  of  thebest  products  of  the  evangelical  movement  wasfamiliar  to  the  lad  as  he  saw  it  in  both  his  father45and  mother.  He  was  too  young  to  have  been46   LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFASTgreatly  stirred  by  the  battle  which  Dr.  Cooke  hadjust  won  against  moderatism  and  a  loose  Arian-ism — as  it  was  called  in  those  days.  The  signsof  Dr.  Cooke's  victory  were  the  enforcement  ofsubscription  to  the  standards  and  the  control  of  thetheological  teaching  in  Belfast.  The  intellectuallife  of  the  north  of  Ireland  had  been  quickenedby  the  struggle.  Although  the  College  of  Belfast  as  then  at  work  would  to-day  be  regardedas  poorly  equipped,  and  badly  arranged,  neitherequipment  nor  systems  really  constitute  a  placeof  learning.  There  was  to  be  found  in  its  teaching  the  fresh  earnest  spirit  of  a  triumphantchurch.  The  class-rooms  still  resounded  withthe  arguments  and  the  battle-cries  of  the  pastconflict,  but  better  than  these  battle-cries  therepervaded  the  lecture-rooms  a  deep  sense  of  anewly  awakened  religious  feeling.  High  personal  standards  of  godly  living  and  entire  consecration  to  the  work  of  the  ministry  made  thetheological  students  a  powerful  influence  amongtheir  fellows.  The  whole  atmosphere  of  theplace  was  pervaded  by  the  intense  feeling  towhich  the  reawakening  had  given  rise.According  to  the  arrangement  of  studies  thefirst  sessions  were  devoted  to  the  liberal  arts.The  professors  in  the  theological  departmentLIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFAST   47taught   however,  here  also.     Hence  the  degreeconferred  upon  "Johannem  Hall"  in  November,1845,  is  signed  by  Drs.   Edgar  as  the  moderatorpro  tern,  Robert  Parks,  Adam  Mongomery  (Examiner  in  Natural  Philosophy),  Killen  (Professorof  History),  Robert  Wilson  (of  Sacred  Literature),Esaias    Stern   (Mathematics),  and  John    Bentley(Examiner  in  Latin).     From  this  it  is  seen  thateven  in  the  undergraduate  days  theological  interests    were    not    neglected.     Lecture    courseswere  paid  for  as  they  were  listened  to,  and  thestudent  received  a  card  from  the  professor  stating  that  the  fee  had  been  paid  and  the  coursecompleted.     At  the  end  of  the  courses  examinations  were  held,  and  in  many  departments  extraexaminations  for  prizes  were  also  taken.     Thenote-books  of  these  early  studies  only  in  partsurvive,  and  are  not  neatly  kept.     But  the  notebooks   of  the  later  specifically  theological  classroom  work  exhibit  great  care,  and  are  written  inthe  fine  and  legible  handwriting  of  which  mention  has  already  been  made.Student  life  in  those  days  was  not  what  it  hassince  become;  and  was  totally  different  from  thehighly  organized  life  of  an  American  College.The  standard  of  expense  was  very  low,  andnearly  all  earned  their  way  in  part  at  least.  It  is48    LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFASTneedless  to  say  that  a  walk  in  the  country  was  theonly  athletic  exercise  common  to  all,  and  that  college  life  was  almost  unknown.  The  students  livedin  lodgings.  They  generally  supplied  their  ownbreakfasts  and  teas.  Dinner  was  supplied  togroups,  who  clubbed  together  for  the  purpose,  byenterprising  families  in  the  neighborhood  of  thecollege  building.  The  class-rooms  were  oftenovercrowded.  Some  of  the  instruction  was  inferior  in  quality.  At  the  same  time  a  spirit  ofearnestness  and  work  made  the  life  a  fruitful  onein  achievement  afterwards.For  a  boy  so  young  as  was  the  subject  of  thislife  the  work  was  hard,  and  in  addition  myfather  soon  began  to  teach  in  a  girls'  school  somedistance  from  the  college  buildings.  This  workof  teaching  he  maintained  until  the  close  of  hisstudies.  He  often  spoke  of  having  rather  wastedthe  first  two  or  three  years  of  his  Belfast  days,but  that  is  not  the  impression  made  by  the  recordof  his  daily  doings.  His  own  testimony  however,  given  in  a  letter  written  years  after,  to  anephew  is  as  follows  :  "I  lost  a  good  deal  oftime  from  being  irregular  in  my  ways  of  working,  at  one  time  idling,  and  at  another  working  likea  horse,  though  the  result  was  too  often  suggestive  of  another  animal  with  longer  ears.  I  hope  youjt-S^gc    j£e^<>&~  &-j£^ZL-*A~<-*c-<-£..-/.'  -     Trtm+r^.LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFAST   49will  work  steadily,  never  running  in  arrears.     Bethorough  in  whatever  you  learn  and  skim  nothing. "Undoubtedly  the  real  intellectual  and  spiritualinfluences  of  the  college  began  to  be  felt  mostdistinctly  when  the  formal  theological  courseshad  been  entered  upon.It  was  at  this  time  that  a  few  earnest  friendsbanded  themselves  together  to  pray,  to  improvetheir  own  spiritual  life  and  to  promote  a  newmissionary  spirit.  When  separating  for  their  life-work  these  friends  resolved  that  on  Saturdayevenings  they  should  remember  each  other  inprayers  and  by  name  as  long  as  they  lived.That  little  roll  of  names  has  been  sadly  reduced  by  death  and  the  everlasting  reunionof  an  eternal  fellowship  has  begun.  The  fellowship  was  very  dear  to  them  all,  andformed  an  abiding  influence  upon  my  father'slife.  Often  on  Saturday  nights  he  spoke  ofthose  friends,  and  recalled  the  early  aspirationsand  inspirations  of  those  college  days.  He  hadlater  in  life  a  little  reproduction  made  of  his  listof  names  and  addresses  as  he  furnished  them  tothe  little  band  as  a  reminder  of  their  pledge.The  missionary  spirit  was  particularly  emphasized  by  Dr.  Edgar  who  met  with  the  studentsand  guided  them  in  their  work  and  prayer  con-5o   LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFASTferences.  Hence  his  name  appears  among  thoseto  be  ever  remembered  before  the  throne  ofgrace,  although  he  was  as  a  teacher  looked  uponsomewhat  differently  from  the  student  friends.To  Dr.  Edgar  all  eagerly  went  for  advice  andhelp,  and  his  theology  seems,  along  with  that  ofDr.  Cooke,  to  have  practically  moulded  the  theological  thought  of  the  little  band.The  type  of  thought  was  that  prevalent  aboutthat  time  in  Calvinistic  circles  that  had  felt  the  influence  of  the  evangelical  movement.  Naturallyit  was  eclectic  and  not  always  scientifically  self-consistent,  but  in  its  clear  defmiteness,  and  sharppositive  outlines,  it  was  a  system  well  suited  forthe  practical  work  given  the  men  to  do.In  Hebrew  and  Church  History  and  later  inChurch  History  Essays  my  father  repeatedly  tookprizes  for  good  work.  These  were  in  the  formof  well  selected  books,  admirably  bound,  andwell  fitted  even  to-day  to  grace  a  good  library.Naturally  the  north  of  Ireland  looked  largelyto  Scotland  for  intellectual  stimulus.  Continentalthought  left  little  or  no  traces  on  the  lecturenotes,  and  many  of  the  modern  questions  were,of  course,  not  even  considered.  Dr.  Cooke  inhis  controversy  had  had  occasion  to  build  up  avery  strict  theory  of  inspiration,  and  this  wasLIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFAST   51thoroughly  inculcated  not  only  by  himself,  butby  the  teachers  whom  he  had  to  some  degreegathered  about  him  in  Belfast.  The  main  outlines  of  this  system  were  accepted  cordially  bymy  father,  and  he  never  saw  any  reason  forseriously  modifying  them.The  influence  of  Dr.  Cooke's  clear  systemsoftened  a  good  deal  by  the1  kindlier  spirit  of  Dr.Edgar  is  marked  in  the  correspondence  of  all  thesestudent  friends  throughout  its  course.In  after  years  the  influence  of  this  supreme  manof  action  is  traceable  throughout  my  father's  life,even  though  differences  on  various  subjects  hadsomewhat  widely  separated  Dr.  Cooke  from  myfather.  At  this  time,  also,  a  struggle  was  goingon  in  the  then  established  church  of  Ireland,which  influenced  the  young  student.  This  conflict  was  between  the  evangelical  elements  onthe  one  hand,  and  the  so-called  "high  and  dry"party  on  the  other,  whose  ascendency  dated  fromLaud.  In  this  struggle  the  sympathies  of  thePresbyterians  were  naturally  with  evangelicalism.  This  produced  a  very  deep  and  bitter  feeling  against  the  Presbyterians  on  the  part  of  theEstablished  Church  on  its  high  church  side.  Indeed  they  attempted  to  revive  old  laws  by  whichcertain  Presbyterian  marriages  were  illegal,  and52   LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFASTonly  in  1844  was  a  bill  passed  in  the  face  of  thebitter  opposition  of  the  Irish  bishops  making  theoffspring  of  such  marriages  legitimate.  Theteaching  therefore  of  Belfast  at  that  time  was  fullof  polemic,  not  always  moderate  in  tone,  againstthe  claims  of  Rome  and  the  High  Church  Episcopacy.  Particularly  forceful  and  complete  wasDr.  Killen's  treatment  of  the  Protestant  side  ofthis  controversy.  These  were  the  special  influences  that  controlled  to  a  good  degree  the  development  of  my  father's  thought.At  the  same  time  distinct  notes  of  the  evangelical  awakening  appear  in  his  early  religious  experience.  The  very  banding  together  of  thegroup  of  friends  reminds  us  of  similar  bands  inOxford  and  under  the  haystack  in  New  England.The  missionary  spirit  was  new  to  Presbyterian-ism,  and  was  an  importation  from  the  evangelical  awakening.  This  laid  strong  hold  upon  thesefriends,  and  the  field  of  labor  nearest  to  them  wasConnaught  and  the  south  of  Ireland  generally.The  students  of  the  college  formed  a  society  tosupport  missionaries  of  their  own  in  this  region.In  this  work  my  father  took  an  active  part.The  social  activity  of  the  awakening  was  alsoa  marked  feature  of  the  best  religious  life  ofthose  days.  Temperance  bands  were  formed  toLIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFAST   53combat  the  great  and  increasing  evils  of  drunkenness.     The  older  orthodoxy  looked  with  suspicious  eye    upon    this    movement,    and    somefiercely  resented  it  as  an  imputation  upon  thevirtue  and  Christian  living  of  undoubtedly  goodmen  of  the  past,  who  nevertheless  often  camehome  decidedly  the  worse  for  the  social  glassalways  offered  at  weddings  or  any  social  gathering.It  was  at  that  time  the  custom,  as  it  indeedstill  is  in  parts  of  Ireland  to-day,  to  distribute"tokens"  or  little  pieces  of  metal  before  thecommunion  to  those  qualified  to  go  to  the  Lord'stable.     The  minister  before  the  quarterly  communion  distributes  these  "tokens,"  going  with  anelder  from  house  to  house.     At  each  house  something  was  offered  to  drink,  and  alas!  many  a  timethe  days  before  the  communion  found  excellentmen  of  really  godly  disposition  confused  and  disturbed  if  not  actually  intoxicated  in  consequence  ofthe  necessity  laid  upon  them  of  accepting  this  mistaken  hospitality.     Against  this  evil  my  grandfather,  William  Hall  as  an  elder  protested.    And  although  he  was  not  himself  a  total  abstainer  in  thetechnical  sense,  he  impressed  upon  his  boy  John  thesense  of  the  evils  of  intemperance,  and  led  the  youngstudent  to  give  much  of  his  time  both  as  a  youngman  and  later  on  in  life  to  temperance  reform.54   LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFASTMy  father  wrote  once  what  he  called  a  "temperate  autobiography  "  in  explanation  of  hisstand  in  this  matter.  He  did  not  sympathizewith  the  political  extremists  in  his  American  life,and  to  some  degree  the  "autobiography"  wasin  answer  to  criticisms  upon  his  position.  Iventure  to  quote  the  article  almost  in  full."  In  good  old  times  fifty  years  ago,  informalhospitality  took  the  frequent  form  of  a  '  glass  ofwine'  or  'punch.'  It  was  the  handiest  thingto  offer  a  caller  who  came  between  meals.  Thefarmers  were  civil  to  one  another  in  the  way  ofexchanging  drinks  at  fair  or  market.  Indeed,  inmany  cases,  this  was  the  way  in  which  they  paidfor  the  care  of  their  horses:  they  'put  up'  inthe  yard  of  such  an  inn,  and  it  was  the  correctthing  to  '  take  something  for  the  good  of  thehouse.'  In  every  parish  one  could  name  two  orthree  farmers  known  to  be  'too  fond  of  aglass;'  but  the  thing  would  not  be  much  orseverely  spoken  of.  It  was  often  the  one  blot  onthe  life,  otherwise  exceptionally  good  and  kindly.Boys  were  not  encouraged  to  drink;  and  commonly  did  not."At  college,  at  the  age  of  thirteen,  I  heard,  nowand  then,  of  a  student  who  took  drink  to  excess.Sometimes  they  were  what  we  called  the  '  med-LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFAST   55icals.'  Illustrating  the  differences  in  habits  indifferent  countries,  for  a  man  to  be  known  astaking  'oyster  suppers'  then  imperilled  hisreputation.  They  were  a  form  of  costly  luxury,indulgence  in  which  was  suspicious.  We  werefew  of  us  rich.  We  all  paid  our  own  way,  andour  class  fees,  and  most  of  us  learned  two  things— the  value  of  a  shilling,  and  the  habit  of  self-reliance.  The  only  temperance  advocates  ofwhom  I  had  then  any  knowledge  were  three;first,  Father  Mathew,  who,  from  1840  onward,made  himself  felt  in  Ireland;  then  LymanBeecher,  whose  'six  sermons'  had  been  broughtto  my  notice  by  Dr.  John  Edgar,  the  third,  andwho  ardently  urged  temperance  as  distinguishedfrom  total  abstinence.  Though  he  took  nowine  himself,  his  arguments  and  societies  wereagainst  the  use  of  'intoxicating  liquors,'  and  hedid  not  put  wine  among  them.  The  first  I  onlyknew  by  public  reports;  the  second  by  the  'sixsermons;'  the  third  I  often  heard,  and  latercame  to  know  intimately.  He  was  a  noble,  eloquent,  public-spirited  man."  Before  graduating  I  lived  for  eighteen  monthsin  the  house  of  the  teacher  at  whose  school  I  hadprepared  for  college.  I  was  classical  master.Friendly  entertainments  were  common,  for  he56   LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFASTwas  well-to-do  and  hospitable.  From  the  influences  already  named  I  took  no  drink  at  dinner,the  way  being,  on  these  occasions,  to  remove  thecloth,  and  set  down  wines  and  stronger  drinks,sugar  and  hot  water.  I  recall  with  gratitude  thekindness  of  his  wife  who  used  to  'slip'  beforeme  delicious  raspberry  vinegar,  which,  withsugar  and  hot  water,  looked  as  nice  as  anybody's'tumbler,'  and  saved  the  awkwardness  of  avery  verdant  youth  tacitly  rebuking  his  seniors.The  hospitality  was  well  meant,  but  bad  in  itseffects.  I  can  recall,  among  others,  a  man  of  undoubted  genius — for  it  requires  genius  to  inspireboys  of  twelve  with  a  love  of  Homer — whoseprofessional  career  was  marred  by  the  habitsthere,  at  least  in  part,  contracted."  Entering  the  theological  college  in  1845,  I  wasa  student  under  Dr.  Edgar.  Some  ministers  hadbeen  deposed  for  intemperance.  A  temperancesociety  was  formed;  it  is  hard  to  say  why,  butmy  fellow-students  made  me  its  secretary.  Itspromise  was  against  '  intoxicating  drinks.'  Wewere  not  bound  against  wine,  but  we  rarelydrank  it;  some  from  disinclination;  some  for  thesame  reason  that  many  estimable  people  here  inNew  York  do  not  eat  terrapin."  We  were  practically  total  abstainers,  but  withLIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFAST   57a  general  idea  that  to  include  wine  in  our  pledgewould  reflect  upon  names  and  institutions  religiously  dear  to  us.  Then  I  became  a  minister,  andof  course  had  often  to  remonstrate  with  personswho  '  drank  to  be  drunk.'  Many  of  these  werefarmers,  first  in  the  West,  and  then  in  the  county-town  of  my  native  county.  A  sturdy  farmer  ofmy  charge  would  fall  under  my  eye,  on  the  market-day,  when  he  would  rather  not  have  seenme.  Talking  to  him  then  would  have  been  unwise.  Taking  him  in  a  calmer  mood  and  aquieter  place  I  would  make  my  kindly  protest.These  men  are  commonly  honest  and  frank,  andI  always  liked  them  for  it.  '  All  very  well,  foryou,  Mr.  Hall,'  (I  had  not  been  doctored  then),'to  talk  that  way.  You  can  take  your  wine.We  can't  do  that  ;  we  take  what  we  can  get,  andit  is  stronger.'  So  he  would  answer."Then  it  was— over  thirty  years  ago— that  Icame  to  say:  'Well,  I  rarely  take  it,  but  to  takethat  ground  from  under  your  feet,  here,  now,  Iabstain  from  wine,  too,  as  a  beverage,'  and  Ifound  the  appeal  so  made  had  its  weight  withthem.  I  found  others  of  my  friends  pursuingthe  same  course,  and  also  putting  it  from  theirtable,  and  ceasing  to  offer  it  to  friends.  Whenwe  said  'as  a  beverage'  we  meant  to  exclude58   LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFASTthe  communion  wine  and  the  medicinal  use  of  it,and  on  that  ground  my  old  associates  in  Irelandstill  stand."The  enthusiasm  of  the  temperance  band  mentioned  above  for  temperance  reform  finds  expression  in  the  correspondence  of  that  date.Slavery  was  not  a  burning  question  in  thenorth  of  Ireland,  but  it  was  one  of  the  issuesforced  upon  England  by  the  evangelical  revival,so  in  Ireland  also  meetings  were  held  to  denounceslavery  and  encourage  the  "  underground  railroad"  in  America  in  its  operations  just  then  beginning.This  "heresy,"  for  so  it  also  was  deemed  bythe  older  orthodoxy,  my  father  also  embraced,and  this  interest  together  with  the  missionaryenthusiasm  soon  led  to  a  correspondence  withMr.  George  H.  Stuart  of  Philadelphia,  his  distantcousin  and  lifelong  friend.Perhaps,  however,  the  most  signal  note  of  themarked  connection  between  the  evangelicalmovement  and  this  religious  interest  was  theemphasis  early  placed  upon  teaching.  Just  asthe  Methodist  movement  began  by  startingschools,  so  the  missionary  activity  of  the  newspiritual  life  in  the  north  of  Ireland  was  shownin  the  desire  to  bring  spelling  and  reading  withinLIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFAST    59the  reach  of  even  the  poorest,  whether  Protestantor  Catholic.  This  firm  confidence  that  educationmust  bring  the  truth  of  God  to  light,  and  a  certain  fearlessness  born  of  the  assurance  that  thetruth  will  stand  examination  marked  the  wholetone  of  Dr.  Cooke's  and  Dr.  Edgar's  teachings;it  also  controlled  wholesomely  their  ecclesiasticalpolicy,  but  has  not  always  found  imitators.This  same  Protestant  spirit  also  marked  thetemper  of  my  father.  He  felt  that  even  dangerous  teachings  must  be  duly  and  fairly  examined,then  answered  and  exposed.  In  this  spirit  andunder  the  guidance  of  Dr.  Killen  he  made  as  astudent  an  examination  of  the  Jesuit  movement,and  produced  an  essay  that  gained  recognitionby  taking  of  a  prize.  The  fairness  and  calmnessof  the  treatment  of  this  topic  by  a  boy  in  the  northof  Ireland  at  that  day  is  a  quite  remarkable  evidence  of  the  sanity  of  the  historical  class-room.Naturally  the  literature  at  hand  was  limited  inamount  and  defective  in  accuracy;  at  the  sametime  the  spirit  of  the  essay  is  scholarly  and  although  of  course  intensely  Protestant  is  freefrom  the  fanatical  perversions  all  too  common  ineven  mature  polemical  writing.The  personal  religious  life  of  the  day  was  alsostrongly  under  the  influence  of  the  evangelical60   LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFASTmodes  of  expression.  The  eager,  sober-mindedstudent,  hardly  started  upon  the  ministry  beforea  diary  was  opened  in  which  religious  experienceand  the  results  of  careful  self-examination  are  dulynoted.  Later  side-notes  mark  the  distrust  myfather  felt  of  this  excessive  self-examinationmade  common  by  the  Methodist  class-room.  Atthe  same  time  what  has  for  us  at  this  day  an  airof  unreality  if  not  of  positive  cant,  was  withoutquestion  the  sincere  and  earnest  expression  ofpowerful  longings,  not  always  happily  expressed,for  a  more  profound  spiritual  experience,  and  ahigher  personal  attainment  in  holiness.Another  mark  was  the  religious  poetry  inwhich  all  the  friends  seem  to  have  more  or  lessindulged.  In  undergraduate  days  my  fatherfilled  a  note-book  with  somewhat  indifferent,  yetharmless  and  even  smooth  good  English  verse.Later  he  brands  the  volume  as  "trash"  andmarks  the  fact  that  now  he  despised  what  he  thenadmired,  and  disclaims  particularly  some  veryharmless  verse  in  honor  of  a  young  lady  relatedto  him  and  an  old  family  friend.  From  this  onthe  verses  are  religious  in  character,  though  theliterary  quality  does  not  improve.  In  his  laterstudies  of  English  literature  the  student  again  returned  to  secular  themes,  and  often  my  father  hasLIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFAST   61told  me  that  verse  making  was  in  his  judgment  afine  training  for  the  rhythm  and  balance  neededin  a  rhetorical  pulpit  style.  He  continued  alsothe  habit  gained  from  his  father  of  learningpoetry,  and  although  he  seldom  quoted  it  in  hislater  years,  his  early  sermons  have  frequent  quotations  included,  and  indeed  so  many  are  closedwith  a  selection  of  poetry  that  it  seems  almost  tohave  been  a  habit  in  early  life  to  do  this.At  this  time  the  young  student's  taste  seems  tohave  been  for  the  rather  morbid  religious  poetryof  the  evangelical  revival,  and  for  Byron.  Hedid  not  own  Shakespeare,  but  at  his  boarding-house  in  Belfast  the  works  of  the  master  were  inthe  dining-room.  School  duties  kept  him  up  todinner-time,  or  nearly  so,  and  he  went  directlyfrom  the  school  where  he  taught  to  the  boarding-place.  There  in  the  few  minutes  that  elapsedbefore  the  meal  was  ready  he  succeeded  in  reading  the  whole  edition  through.  The  class-booknotes  of  some  of  the  college  afternoon  sessionsare  enriched  by  eager  imitations  of  the  dramasthat  had  been  thus  devoured  while  he  was  waiting.Life  early  became  a  very  sober  reality  for  theeldest  boy  in  a  large  family.  The  head  of  thehousehold  was  most  evidently  failing  rapidly.62   LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFASTBoth  father  and  son  were  eager  to  see  the  collegeand  theological  courses  completed.  For  thefather  this  was  not  quite  to  be.  On  the  2Oth  ofSeptember,  1848,  the  son  was  suddenly  called  tosay  farewell  to  his  best  earthly  friend.  He  hadreached  home  in  time,  and  in  a  letter  to  his  friendMatthew  Kerr  he  announced  his  loss.  The  letteris  mature  for  a  lad  of  nineteen  in  the  midst  of  hisfirst  real  and  terrible  sorrow.  He  writes  :MY  DEAR  MATTHEW  :45  Joy  Street,September  2bth.The  event  which  has  stained  this  paper  (the  black  border)has  been  the  cause  of  my  long  silence  at  which  you  no  doubtwondered.  On  Saturday  fortnight  I  was  written  for  to  see  myfather,  and  till  he  had  passed  into  a  world  without  sickness  orpain  I  sat  by  his  bed,  rejoicing  that  in  him  patience  had  (done)its  perfect  work.  .  .  .  After  this  he  had  no  pain  butwhat  followed  from  weakness  and  exhaustion  and  on  Tuesdaynight  last  slept  in  Jesus.  The  day  before  I  got  home  he  had"  set  his  house  in  order,"  and  after  that  act  he  spoke  andprayed  as  one  who  had  no  more  to  do  with  the  world.  He  wasable  to  converse  freely  till  the  last,  and  his  conversation  wasin  heaven.  We  had  made  it  a  subject  of  prayer  that  he  mighthave  such  glimpses  of  the  glory  that  shall  be  revealed  as  mightentirely  wean  the  affections  from  earth — was  that  right?  Atany  rate,  it  would  appear  to  have  been  granted,  as  he  spoke  ofthe  last  enemy  with  perfect  composure,  talked  of  his  changewith  joy  though  we  all  wept  around  him,  and  appeared  to  havemuch  of  the  assurance  of  faith.  On  my  offering  him  a  littlewine  at  one  time  he  said  he  should  soon  "  drink  new  wine  inour  Father's  Kingdom,"  and  when  I  asked  him  had  he  no  fearsfor  eternity,  his  answer  was  "  Who  is  he  that  condemneth  ?  ItLIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFAST   63is  Christ  that  died,  etc."  I  have  reason  to  bless  God  that  I  wasable  to  talk  with  him  as  one  FRIEND  to  another  for  it  seemed  as  ifthe  relations  of  father  and  son  were  at  times  forgotten  and  webecame  equals  in  Christ.  On  Friday  most  of  our  congregation,of  which  he  was  the  oldest  elder,  though  but  fifty,  and  very  manyfriends  of  all  denominations  accompanied  all  of  him  that  wasmortal  to  the  house  appointed  for  all  living.  The  text  of  afuneral  sermon  preached  yesterday  was  appropriate,  "  Therighteous  hath  hope  in  his  death."  ...  I  hope  youwill  write  to  me  soon.  I  trust  I  am  not  repining  although  Ifeel  very  lonely  and  melancholy,  at  times  I  cannot  repress  a  feeling  of  desolation — but  I  bless  God  that  I  need  not  sorrow  asthose  who  have  no  hope.  If  you  would  learn  divinity  go  tothe  deathbed  of  a  believer,  if  you  would  know  the  meaning  ofChrist's  being  precious  see  a  believer  looking  death  in  the  face.If  you  would  see  the  sufficiency  of  the  doctrine  of  free  grace  tosupport  and  comfort  in  the  last  struggles  hear  a  believer's  dyingwords.  My  father's  were  "  I  die  happy."  This  he  repeatedsuddenly  as  if  some  new  idea  had  flashed  on  his  mind.  Afterthis  he  only  repeated  with  difficulty  "  Why  tarry  the  wheels,etc.,"  and  soon  after  murmured  with  difficulty  "joy  unspeakableand  full  of  glory  ! "  and  soon  slept  away.  Dear  Matthew,"  may  you  and  I  die  the  death  of  the  righteous,  and  let  ourlatter  end  be  like  his."  .  .  .Ever  affectionately  yours,J.  HALL.This  death  meant  very  serious  struggle  withuncertainty  and  various  calls  of  seeming  duty.The  family  was  not  rich.  The  teaching  that  hadso  largely  been  supporting  the  student  had  beengiven  up  to  go  to  the  sick  bedside.  And  a  call  togo  to  work  in  Connaught  had  been  pressed  indirectly  by  some  interested  in  the  schools  there.64   LIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFASTThe  mother  was  firm  in  her  intention  to  have  thestudy  for  God's  ministry  unbroken.  The  placein  the  school  was  kept  open,  and  my  father  returned  feeling  that  he  could  be  more  use  to  hisbrothers  and  sisters  if  he  completed  honorablyhis  course  of  study.  It  was  with  heart  heavywith  a  sense  of  responsibility  for  the  whole  family,a  burden  never  laid  down  while  life  lasted,  thatthe  bereaved  boy  returned  to  Belfast  to  take  upthe  final  duties  and  decisions  of  a  last  year  of  theological  education.The  band  of  students  had  settled  upon  theiryoungest  member  to  represent  them  on  the  missionary  field  of  Connaught.  Matthew  Kerr  andHamilton  Magee  were  already  at  work,  and  withmuch  misgiving  and  fear  and  trembling  the  decision  was  accepted  as  "from  the  Lord,"  and  theimmediate  future  was  thus  determined.  Although  with  a  large  measure  of  self-control  myfather  was  really  a  shy  and  self-distrustful  man.He  was  also  proud  in  the  best  sense  of  that  word.Self-respect  was  born  in  him,  and  no  virtue  hasshone  more  clearly  in  the  stock  from  which  hesprang.  He  greatly  dreaded  the  coming  plungeinto  active  life.  He  dreaded  meeting  new  facesand  new  ways.  And  yet  through  his  shy  self-distrust  there  breaks  from  time  to  time  the  senseLIFE  AND  STUDIES  IN  BELFAST   65of  strength  and  confidence  in  his  cause  and  inhimself.He  passed  out  from  the  college  with  the  loveand  respect  of  all  his  classmates,  and  the  highregards  of  his  instructors.  With  Dr.  Edgar  andDr.  Killen  his  relations  became  those  of  intimacy.With  Dr.  Cooke  he  always  felt  a  sense  of  "distant  awe,"  he  once  remarked,  and  although  therelations  remained  cordial  up  to  the  parting,  whendeath  took  Dr.  Cooke,  yet  some  differences  ofjudgment  in  regard  to  ecclesiastical  politics  prevented,  in  addition  to  great  differences  in  age,the  same  intimate  relations  that  marked  thefriendships  with  the  others.  Moreover  Dr.Cooke  was  in  these  last  years  not  very  active  asa  teacher,  and  only  in  his  ministry  and  in  a  classin  Bible  exposition  did  my  father  come  much  incontact  with  the  great  leader  to  whom  Irish  Protestantism  owes  so  great  a  debt.III.

THE  CALL  TO  ARMAGH.ALL  the  evils  of  wrong  social  adjustment  in  itsmany  forms  have  made  themselves  seen  infearful  vividness  in  Ireland.  The  distances  between  the  owners  and  the  workers  of  the  soilhave  been  made  felt  by  differences  in  religion,custom,  race  and  even  tongue.  In  the  changefrom  an  agricultural  to  an  industrial  state  Englandsuffered  bitterly,  but  she  had  coal  and  made  thechange  to  her  advantage  in  the  main.  Irelandhad  no  coal.  Blundering  and  even  purposelyselfish  laws  had  wiped  out  what  industry  Irelandpossessed.  Only  in  the  north  of  Ireland,— whererelative  homogeneity  of  population,  a  greaterintelligence,  Protestant  freedom  and  the  nearnessof  English  coal  gave  industry  a  chance  to  survive,did  the  population  really  prosper.69In  the  south  and  west  the  introduction  of  thepotato  made  existence  possible  for  a  large  pop-yo  THE  WEST  OF  IRELANDulation,  but  it  also  excluded  any  thought  ofproper  progress.  No  section  was  more  dependent  upon  the  potato  than  the  beautiful  but  poorprovince  of  Connaught,  and  no  part  of  that  province  is  poorer  than  the  southern  section  immediately  between  the  Shannon  and  the  wild  Atlantic.Here  in  1846  the  blight  that  fell  upon  the  potato  wasfelt  at  once.  Hunger  stared  the  peasant  in  the  face.Dr.  John  Edgar,  professor  of  divinity  at  theRoyal  college  of  Belfast,  was  at  that  time  in  Con-naught  making  an  evangelistic  tour.  He  wasthe  first  to  sound  the  alarm  of  coming  famine  ina  letter  which  had  an  enormous  circulation.  Theinterest  aroused  in  Belfast  was,  of  course,  verygreat.  In  a  letter  to  the  Banner  of  Ulster  Dr.Edgar  wrote  of  the  population:  "  The  great  proportion  of  them  live  on  a  bare  and  unproductivesoil;  a  few  are  possessors  of  as  fertile  a  land  aswas  ever  warmed  by  a  genial  sun.  But  whatcan  a  farm  of  three  or  four  acres — the  averagesize  over  large  districts— do  for  the  support  of  afamily  ?  Oats  grown  on  it  all,  without  any  pasture  for  the  lean  ass,  man's  faithful  servant  here,would  be  far,  indeed,  from  producing,  in  meal,a  sufficient  supply,  even  were  the  landlord  toforego  his  whole  claim.  The  potato,  therefore,has  been  the  only  resource,  and  in  most  casesTHE  WEST  OF  IRELAND  71without  any  addition  but  salt,  or  as  a  luxury  saltfish,  their  only  food.  Corn  mills  are  for  the  rich,and  even  the  old  querns,1  once  turned  by  thehand  of  the  poor,  are  of  no  use  now;  for  the  pigso  carefully  reared,  and  all  the  corn,  scarcely  suffice  to  satisfy  the  landlord's  demands."The  awful  year  of  famine  was  followed  by  ayear  of  hunger  typhus.  The  famine  had  not,  ofcourse,  touched  the  richer  land-owning  classes,but  the  fever  did,  and  in  1848  their  resourceswere  strained  and  financial  disaster  followed  forthem.  Ruin  passed  from  family  to  family  overthe  whole  south  and  west  of  the  country.Then  to  crown  all  in  1849  cholera  made  its  appearance  and  stalked  amidst  the  hunger-rackedpeasantry,  and  the  now  bewildered  and  disheartened  gentry.It  was  only  natural  that  the  Student's  Missionary  association,  with  Dr.  Edgar  as  the  leadingspirit,  should  turn  to  distracted  Connaught  fortheir  field  of  labor.  So  it  came  about  that  theassociation  chose  one  of  the  youngest  graduatesof  1849  to  follow  some  friends,  sent  the  yearbefore,  into  the  work  of  home  missions  in  thewest  of  Ireland.1  Quern  was  the  coarse  hand-mill  used  to  grind  the  corn  fordistilling  purposes.72  THE  WEST  OF  IRELANDIt  was  thus  in  the  summer  of  1849,  on  the  6thof  June,  that  my  father  started  on  the  longjourney,  of  those  days,  for  Connaught.  Themail  coach  left  Belfast  very  early  in  the  morning,but  only  part  of  the  way  could  be  travelled  by  themail  coach,  hence  a  car  was  used  from  Cloue  tothe  final  destination.It  was  with  great  fear  and  trembling  that  theraw  and  shy  lad  fresh  from  college  undertook  thework.  Letters  of  that  period  speak  of  long  andprayerful  consideration.  Self-distrust  and  fear  lestthe  cause  should  suffer  through  inexperienceor  want  of  thought  made  the  young  student  hesitate  longer  than  Dr.  Edgar  thought  right,  in  undertaking  the  commission  of  the  students.The  examination  before  the  presbytery  hadbeen  satisfactory,  although  shyness  had  been  somarked  in  the  sermon  which  had  to  be  preached,that  one  of  the  older  members  in  kindly  fashion  toldthe  young  preacher  he  would  get  more  help  looking  into  the  eyes  of  those  he  was  speaking  to  thanby  trying  to  bore  a  hole  in  the  roof  with  his  eye.  lThe  work  Dr.  Edgar  had  started  in  the  west  ofIreland  consisted  largely  in  schools  of  an  industrial  as  well  as  religious  character.  He  had  seen1  The  first  actual  sermon  preached  was  in  the  little  school-house  at  Ballygorman — his  old  home.THE  WEST  OF  IRELAND  73that  the  population  must  learn  to  support  itself,and  that  particularly  the  women  must  be  taughtsome  useful  art.  Thousands  of  the  young  menwere  already  leaving  the  countryside.  Womenand  girls  were  left.  Knitting  and  embroideringlinen  were  the  household  arts  of  the  north  ofIreland.  An  association  was  formed  in  Belfastof  women  to  cooperate  with  Christian  womenover  the  west  of  Ireland  in  founding  schools  inwhich  reading  the  Bible  and  knitting  and  embroidery  formed  the  threefold  course.  In  thisschool  work  teachers  were  employed,  but  voluntary  effort  was  also  engaged.My  father  had  had,  for  so  young  a  man,  a  wideexperience  in  teaching.  As  a  mere  child  he  hadtaught  a  night  class,  as  we  have  seen,  in  thekitchen  of  the  old  home.  From  that  on  he  wasengaged  in  teaching  more  or  less  steadily  allthrough  his  course.  In  his  college  experience  hehad  had  to  do  with  girls  and  young  ladies,some  older  than  himself.  All  this  was  of  greathelp  to  him  as  he  undertook  his -missionary  workin  Ireland.  Often  in  after  life  he  has  said  to  me,"No  knowledge  or  experience  comes  amiss  tothe  preacher."His  work  was  the  inspection  of  schools,  preaching  at  various  stations,  distributing  tracts,  visit-74  THE  WEST  OF  IRELANDing  the  people  at  their  homes,  and  establishingSunday-schools.  He  rode  a  good  deal  fromplace  to  place,  and  preached  as  often  as  a  servicecould  be  arranged.  The  nearest  larger  centrewas  Boyle,  and  headquarters  were  near  Camlin.Here  the  schools  had  had  the  earnest  and  untiringsupport  of  Mrs.  Emily  Irwin,  the  lifelong  friendof  Dr.  Edgar.  From  the  very  beginning  of  thework  a  warm  friendship  was  established  between  Mrs.  Irwin  and  my  father.  Mrs.  Irwinhad  been  married  very  early  in  life,  and  veryearly  had  been  left  a  widow  with  three  little  boys.The  affection  between  my  father  and  Mrs.  Irwinripened  into  love,  and  very  soon  a  practical  engagement  was  concluded.  The  union  was  a  mostfitting  one,  and  like  interests  and  tastes  made  therelationship  a  sweet  and  blessed  partnership  inthe  life  work  of  the  ministry.  Mrs.  Irwin  hadoffered  a  site  to  her  own  church — the  EstablishedChurch  of  Ireland — for  a  school,  but  this  offerwas  refused.  Dr.  Edgar  however  accepted  it,and  secured  hearty  support  of  his  work  in  Camlin  from  the  whole  Irwin  relationship.  Theseschools  were  productive  of  a  vast  amount  ofgood,  and  years  after  in  the  far  west  of  Americaprosperous  farms  and  comfortable  homes  told  ofthe  good  the  instruction  in  these  schools  had  done.THE  WEST  OF  IRELAND  75One  of  the  little  band  of  college  friends,  theRev.  Matthew  Kerr,  was  at  work  at  DromoreWest,  some  distance  from  Boyle,  and  another,  theRev.  Hamilton  Magee,  was  engaged  at  some  littledistance  from  Dromore.  It  was  therefore  one  ofthe  pleasures  of  the  work  that  an  occasional  daycould  be  spent  together.  Thus  on  the  i8th  ofJune  is  an  entry  in  a  day-book,  kept  rather  irregularly: —  "Came  home  Sunday  night  weariedfrom  preaching,  but  did  not  go  to  bed.  At  threeo'clock  A.  M.  rode  to  Boyle,  by  mail  to  Ballysodere—thence  by  coach  to  Dromore  to  meet  my  dearfriend  Matt.  Kerr — all  day  there — saw  'theTower  '  and  in  the  evening  joined  by  HamiltonMagee — happy."The  ordination  as  missionary  took  place  inOctober  in  Ballina  where  the  presbytery  met  in1850,  and  by  that  time  the  work  of  the  districtwas  in  fullest  activity.  The  discouragementswere  however  great.  Many  were  leaving  forAmerica.  Land  was  rising  again  in  rental  pricefrom  the  efforts  of  English  undertakers  to  increase  the  size  of  holdings  and  use  the  land  forpastorage.  Nor  was  the  reception  on  the  part  ofthe  Roman  Catholic  priest  cordial.  They  lookedupon  the  whole  movement  as  an  attempt  to  takeadvantage  of  the  needs  of  the  people  to  proselytize.76  THE  WEST  OF  IRELANDThe  work  although  done  by  Presbyterian  ministers  was  in  some  sense  undenominational.Money  was  contributed  to  the  school  work  byMethodists,  Episcopalians  and  especially  byQuakers.  The  instruction  was  simple  andmainly  in  the  reading  of  the  Bible.  Even  RomanCatholic  teachers  were  employed,  and  no  pressurewas  brought  to  bear  on  either  parents  or  children  to  become  Protestants,  save  only  as  the  instruction  in  reading  the  Bible  tended  that  way.Yet  it  was  distinctly  not  only  a  Protestant  but  anevangelical  work  and  as  such  had  the  natural  opposition  of  the  priests.Nor  were  the  priests  the  only  ones  to  resentthe  movement.  The  High  Church  party  of  thosedays  was  rather  the  party  of  Laud  and  the  "  highand  dry'  Anglicans  of  English  History,  thanwhat  we  now  understand  by  the  term.  For  thistype  of  thinking  the  Presbyterian  Church  wasmore  unsympathetic  than  the  Roman  communion.The  Established  Church  was  sharply  divided  intoevangelical  and  High  Church  parties.  The  evangelicals  eagerly  assisted  in  all  the  work  of  theschools,  and  indeed  in  most  cases  had  charge  ofthem.  The  rector  and  curate,  however,  of  Boylefiercely  resented  the  intrusion  of  Presbyterianpreaching.  In  a  letter  dated  June  the  eleventh,THE  WEST  OF  IRELAND  771850,  my  father  writes  to  his  friend  the   Rev.Matthew  Kern"Mv  DEAR  MATTHEW: —"  I  fear  you  think  I  was  '  stiff  '  in  the  matter  ofyour  '  soiree.'  No,  no,  I  really  could  not  go.About  that  time  the  Boyle  clergy  were  preachingagainst  me,  and  one  of  the  sermons  I  am  told  isin  the  press.  The  result  will,  I  trust,  be  mostbeneficial  to  us.  It  was  meantime  diminishedby  half  our  Boyle  congregations;  one  of  thecurates  actually  walking  before  the  chapel,  andturning  the  people  back.  But  it  has  confirmedmany  of  our  higher  class  hearers  who  won't  befrightened  and  who  come  out  here  (Camlin)  toshow  their  sense  of  the  wrong  done  us.  Thecurate  in  one  sermon,  without  any  names,  compared  me  to  'Absalom  (!)  stealing  the  hearts  ofhis  Israel,'  and  warned  them  against  being  ledaway  by  '  youthful  zeal,  etc.'  On  Monday  weeka  missionary  Church  clergyman,  a  rector  inCounty  Longford,  visited  Camlin,  where  I  dinedon  the  day  of  his  arrival  to  meet  him.  I  askedhim  to  lecture  for  me  next  evening,  which  hedid.  I  conducted  the  services  and  he  preached.On  Thursday  he  went  into  Boyle  with  me  and78  THE  WEST  OF  IRELANDwas  a  hearer  in  our  congregation.  This  has  setall  the  High  Church  element  about  Boyle  into  themost  violent  ferment,  and  they  talk  of  '  bringinghim  over  the  coals  '  for  it."On  the  other  hand  the  relations  with  theWesleyans  and  the  evangelical  section  of  theEstablished  Church  were  most  cordial.  Thesuperstition  of  the  people  was  very  great.  Atone  time  a  priest  denounced  from  the  altar -withgreat  violence  my  mother  who  was  exceedinglyactive  in  the  school  and  relief  work.  That  weekshe  was  taken  very  ill  with  fever,  and  for  someweeks  lay  at  death's  door.  The  interpretationput  upon  the  incident  was  in  danger  of  really  injuring  the  school  work,  when  the  priest  himselftook  ill.  He,  poor  fellow,  died  of  the  diseaseand  my  mother  fully  recovered.  The  superstitious  people  now  reversed  the  judgment  and  sawin  the  circumstance  a  direct  endorsement  of  whatthe  poor  priest  had  denounced.Another  discouragement  was  the  political  condition.  The  fierce  resentment  of  the  oppressedIrish  poor  sought  political  utterance.  The  leaderswere  however,  naturally,  not  of  the  highest  class,and  political  violence  and  short-sighted  demandsunited  the  landowning  and  intelligent  classes  in  aresistance  to  the  peasant  movement  which  in-THE  WEST  OF  IRELAND  79eluded  many  reasonable  demands  as  well  as  theunreasoning  violence.  The  condition  was  deplorable.  Dr.  Edgar  himself  described  it  vividlyin  a  letter  to  the  Banner  of  Ulster.  "The  realfact  of  the  case  is  this: — The  poor  Connaughtman  eats  none  of  his  own  corn,  none  of  his  ownbutter,  pig,  all  go  to  pay  his  rent;  and  whateverpotatoes  remain  after  the  pig  is  fed,  are  the  onlyfood,  the  only  support  of  his  family."  He  alsodefended  in  the  same  letter  the  character  of  theConnaught  peasant.  "It  is  a  libel,"  he  wrote,"  on  the  poor  Irishman  to  say  that  he  is  too  lazyor  too  savage  to  seek  for  better  food  than  potatoes.  His  only  nourishment  is  potatoes  becausethe  other  products  of  his  farm  go  to  his  landlord,and  because  potatoes  are  the  only  crop  sufficientlyproductive  to  save  himself  and  his  family  fromstarvation."Around  Camlin  the  poverty  was  not  quite  sogreat  as  in  some  other  districts,  yet  on  the  wholethe  poverty  was  deep,  settled  and  extreme.  TheMayo  district  Dr.  Edgar  in  another  place  describesas  follows:  "When  distress  comes  on  a  man  inhumble  life  here,  (the  north  of  Ireland)  he  hassome  little  store  on  which  to  draw — if  not  moneyat  least  furniture,  or  extra  clothing,  which  he  canplace  in  pawn;  but  the  Connaught  man  has  no8o  THE  WEST  OF  IRELANDclothing  but  what  he  wears;  and  as  for  furniture,you  might  enter  house  after  house  in  Connaught,as  I  have  done,  and  find  no  table,  no  chair,  nocupboard,  no  bedstead,  deserving  the  name,  nospoon,  no  knife,  no  anything,  except  a  squarebox,  and  a  potato  pot,  which  a  pawnbrokerwould  not  take  in  pawn.  In  fact  a  large  proportion  of  the  houses  are  not  fit  for  anything  thatwe  would  dignify  with  the  name  of  furniture.They  have  no  chimney,  no  window;  their  floorsare  fearfully  damp,  their  roofs  are  often  notwater-tight,  and  the  general  custom  is  to  havecow,  pig,  ass,  and  geese,  all  in  the  same  apartment  with  the  family — all  sleeping  together,  andall  going  in  and  out  by  the  same  door."Amid  such  scenes  the  work  was  often  depressing  in  the  extreme,  and  in  the  notes  and  versesof  this  period  there  is  reflected  at  times  the  weariness  and  heartsickness  such  poverty  and  blankignorance  must  produce.The  cheerful  home  in  Camlin  was  a  pleasurethat  could  only  be  enjoyed  at  intervals.  Thefirst  year  and  a  half  were  spent  in  unceasing  inspections  of  schools  and  preaching  at  stationsoften  widely  apart,  with  the  congregation  atBoyle  always  demanding  steady  attention.  Thenstudy  had  to  be  kept  up,  and  late  hours  becameTHE  WEST  OF  IRELAND  81the  rule.  At  last  health  began  to  suffer,  and  thediary  begins  to  note  the  fact  that  bed  had  to  besought  earlier,  and  work  had  to  be  done  in  themorning.  Yet  up  to  very  late  in  life  the  habit  ofmy  father  was  to  do  much  of  his  work  late  atnight.  The  house  was  quiet,  callers  did  not  disturb,  and  far  on  into  the  small  hours  the  busypen  kept  rapid  pace  on  the  paper.In  Connaught  the  habit  was  formed  of  writingfor  the  weekly  papers.  Under  a  pen-name  weekby  week  a  poem  or  letter  appeared  in  the  localcounty  paper.  And  the  editor  of  the  Roscommonand  Leitrim  Gazette  as  well  as  the  Irish  Messenger  soon  found  out  that  a  young  correspondent  was  writing  things  their  readers  were  glad  toget.  Under  the  letter  "P"  or  the  signature"Autos  "  religious  poetry  and  devotional  articlesfound  ready  access  to  the  columns  of  the  localpapers.  Quite  independently  of  the  veneratedDr.  Theodore  L.  Cuyler,  my  father  discoveredas  Dr.  Cuyler  did  what  a  source  of  power  theweekly  press,  religious  and  secular,  might  bemade.  And  all  through  his  life  he  plied  his  penfreely.  Many  times  in  five  different  places  anarticle  would  appear  from  his  ceaseless  pen  inthe  same  week.  He  realized  himself  that  manyof  these  had  only  temporary  value.  Again  and82  THE  WEST  OF  IRELANDagain  he  refused  to  gather  such  writings  into  avolume,  declaring  that  like  his  sermons  they  weremeant  for  the  occasion,  and  the  better  fitted  theywere  for  the  occasion,  the  less  fitted  were  theyfor  permanent  form.  Of  a  number  of  suchpoems  one  obtained  a  wider  circulation  than  theweekly  in  which  it  was  published,  and  is  characteristic  of  the  religious  poetry  more  commonthen,  under  the  inspiration  of  Cowper,  and  manylesser  poets  now  forgotten,  than  it  is  to-day.  Itis  as  follows:THE  MIGNONETTE  AND  THE  OAK.LINES   INSCRIBED  TO  A   MISSIONARY.I  marked  a  child — a  pretty  childA  gentle  blue-eyed  thing;She  sowed  the  scented  mignonetteOne  sunny  day  in  spring.And  as  the  tiny  seed  she  sowedThe  streams  of  thought,  thus  sweetly  flowed."  On  thy  dear  bed  the  dew  shall  fall,And  yon  bright  sun  shall  shine.'Twill  grow  and  bloom  and  blossom  then,And  it  shall  all  be  mine."And  the  fair  thing  laughed  in  childish  glee,To  think  what  harvest  hers  would  be.I  saw  a  man  an  acorn  plant,Upon  the  hillside  bare  ;No  spreading  branch,  no  shading  rockSend  friendly  shelter  there.And  thus  as  o'er  the  acorn  bowedI  heard  him — for  he  thought  aloud.THE  WEST  OF  IRELAND  83"  Frail  thing !  ere  glossy  leaf  shall  graceThy  stem  or  sturdy  bough,I  may  be  laid  amid  the  deadAs  low  as  thou  art  now.Yet  shall  thou  rise  in  rugged  strengthAnd  crown  the  barren  heights  at  length."Each  had  a  hope — the  childish  heartLooked  to  a  summer's  joy.The  manly  thought,  strong  and  matureLooked  to  futurity.Each  trusted  nature's  genial  power.He  sought  a  forest,  she  a  flower.The  unceasing  activity  and  the  energy  of  theyoung  missionary  had  been  noted,  and  alreadymany  who  by  chance  had  heard  him  had  predicted  a  wider  range  for  his  talents,  but  he  himself  was  contented  with  his  work  and  refused  totake  any  steps  towards  a  change.  When  thenit  became  known  that  his  name  was  before  thecongregation  of  the  First  Church  in  Armagh  hetook  pains  to  make  it  known  that  this  was  by  noact  or  word  of  his.  Then  the  church  asked  him,as  was  the  custom,  to  preach  in  turn  with  a  number  of  others.  This  he  refused  to  do.  Whenasked  however  to  supply  the  pulpit  as  the  onlyone  the  church  thought  of,  he  did  so,  in  no  waycommitting  himself  to  acceptance  of  any  callshould  it  come.  In  fact  he  wrote  plainly,  "  I  amnot  weary  of  my  work  as  a  missionary — nor  can84  THE  WEST  OF  IRELANDI  move  in  the  direction  of  leaving  it  unless  theProvidence  of  God  seemed  as  plain  as  in  leadingme  hither.  Now  I  could  not  regard  a  place  in  acandidate's  list  such  an  indication  of  the  path  ofduty."  Family  affairs  called  him  to  the  old  homein  the  County  Armagh,  hence  it  was  natural  andeasy  that  he  should  supply  the  pulpit  for  twoSabbaths.  This  he  did  with  the  result  that  aunanimous  call  was  extended  to  him  to  becomethe  pastor  of  the  church.  The  notice  came  onthe  sixth  of  January,  1852,  that  the  hearty  desireof  the  people  was  expressed  in  the  call,  and  atonce  steps  were  taken  to  sever  the  relationshipsexisting  with  the  presbytery  in  Connaught  to  goto  the  new  field  of  labor.IV.

THENEEDS  OF  DUBLIN.THE  circumstances  of  the  church  life  in  thenew  field  were  entirely  different  from  thoseof  the  missionary  activity  in  the  west  of  Ireland.The  First  Presbyterian  Church  in  Armagh  wassecond  only  perhaps  to  Mary's  Abbey,  Dublin,  inthe  councils  of  the  Church.  The  personal  influence  of  Dr.  Cooke  had  made,  indeed,  his  churchin  Belfast  a  leader  in  all  good  works,  but  theArmagh  church  had  a  long  and  honorable  historythat  gave  it  a  unique  place.  An  able  and  godlyministry  had  preceded  the  vacancy  of  1851,  butvarious  reasons  had  made  the  later  years  of  thatministry  less  effective  in  the  country  districts,dependent  still  upon  the  Church,  than  it  once  hadbeen.  The  farmers  of  the  so-called  "town-lands"  had  been  in  the  habit  of  making  the  gallery  of  the  church  their  special  place.  This  gallery  had  suffered  sorely  from  the  physical  inabil-8788       THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGHity  of  the  preceding  ministry.  It  would  seemsomewhat  a  drain  upon  courage  to  face  theproblem  of  winning  the  support  of  townlandsbearing  such  names  as  Aghanore,  Aghavilly,Ballinagallia,  Ballyharidan,  Ballymoran,  Claughfin,Killyfaddy,  Tullygarnon  and  Torryskean.  Moreover  there  were  fifty-four  of  these  centres  withnames  in  some  cases  even  more  formidable.Beside  these  townlands  there  was  the  town  ofArmagh  itself,  with  a  population  very  different  insome  respects  from  the  townland  congregation.For  the  dealing  with  these  two  sections  of  thechurch  life  the  experiences  in  Belfast  and  the  knowledge  of  country  ways  from  boyhood  up  gave  myfather  a  good  preparation.  His  health  also  had  improved  in  the  west  of  Ireland.  Good  care  had  beentaken  of  him  there,  particularly  by  a  relative  of  Mrs.Irwin.  He  lived  while  there  not  more  than  a  mileand  a  half  from  Camlin  at  a  house  called  Granny,and  although  working  hard  was  free  from  undueanxiety.The  settlement  in  Armagh  made  an  early  marriage  possible  and  the  engagement  of  my  fatherto  Mrs.  Emily  Irwin  was  soon  made  known.  Alittle  sketch  of  my  mother  was  furnished,  at  onetime  to  a  well-known  journal  by  my  father  himself.It  was  almost  as  follows:  "Mrs.  Hall  was  bornMRS.  JOHN  HALLTHE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGH       89at  Monkstown  Castle,  County  Dublin,  a  youngerdaughter  of  an  exceptionally  large  family.  Herfather  was  a  Mr.  Bolton,  who  married  MissCarpenter,  who  died  in  comparatively  early  life.Emily,  who  afterwards  became  Mrs.  Hall,  waseducated  in  Dublin  at  a  school  superintended  byan  accomplished  French  lady.  The  Bolton  familytravelled  a  good  deal  in  France  and  elsewhere,and  in  later  years  most  of  the  members  lived  inEngland,  although  still  retaining  homes  and  property  in  Ireland.  At  a  very  early  age  Miss  EmilyBolton  was  married  to  John  Irwin,  Esq.,  J.  P.,  alanded  proprietor  in  the  west  of  Ireland,  andsettled  at  no  great  distance  from  the  home  of  anolder  sister  also  married  to  a  landlord  in  theneighborhood.  Mr.  Irwin  died  after  a  few  yearsof  happy  married  life,  leaving  his  widow  withthree  boys,  one  of  them  born  after  his  death.Another  sister  of  hers  having  married  a  brotherof  Mr.  Irwin  and  living  in  the  neighborhood,  andin  the  midst  of  a  large  connection  of  relatives,Mrs.  Irwin  continued  to  live  in  the  family  homewhich  was  pleasantly  situated  near  the  town  ofBoyle  in  the  county  of  Roscommon.When  the  "famine"  following  what  wasknown  as  the  potato  failure  came,  multitudes  ofthe  poor  peasantry  around  were  starving.  Mrs.9o       THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGHIrwin  and  her  sister-in-law  looked  about  to  givesome  employment.  Little  could  be  done  for  themen,  although  the  land-steward  employed  asmany  of  them  as  could  be  well  provided  withwork.  At  that  time,  however,  a  kind  of  embroidery  known  as  "sewed  muslin  work"  wasbeing  done  largely  in  the  north  of  Ireland.Firms  in  Scotland  furnished  for  this  purpose  thematerial  and  payed  for  the  work.  Mrs.  Irwindecided  on  trying  to  introduce  this  work.  Thisshe  succeeded  in  doing,  and  by  the  aid  of  thesociety  in  Belfast  under  the  guidance  of  Dr.Edgar  hundreds  were  in  this  way  saved  andgiven  the  means  of  earning  an  honorable  wage.It  was,  as  we  have  seen,  in  the  midst  of  thisactivity  that  my  father  met  the  partner  of  forty-six  years  of  joy  and  sorrow.  Mrs.  Irwin's  sympathies  were  with  the  extreme  evangelicalwing  of  the  Established  Church  to  which  she  belonged.  Her  loyalty  to  the  Established  Churchwas  much  shaken  however,  by  the  way  in  whichthe  school  work  and  the  effort  of  the  associationin  Belfast  were  met  by  the  narrower  section  of  theHigh  Churchmen  ;  it  was  therefore  an  easy  thing  forher  to  throw  in  her  lot  with  the  Presbyterian  faith.She  did  it  intelligently  and  heartily,  and  faithfullyserved  its  interests  as  she  conceived  those  interestsTHE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGH       91to  be  identical  with  God's  kingdom  from  thattime  on.The  wedding  was  a  quiet  one  in  June  I5th,1852,  at  the  Presbyterian  Church  in  Kingstonfrom  the  house  of  General  Irwin  her  brother,  andthen  after  a  short  wedding  trip  the  united  lifebegan  in  the  Master's  service.  It  was  a  familycircle  from  the  beginning,  for  not  only  were  thethree  boys  of  the  first  marriage  in  the  home,  butalso  the  youngest  brother  James,  little  more  thana  lad  at  that  time,  was  still  under  his  brother'scare.  Even  in  Connaught  he  had  largely  beenwith  his  brother.In  Armagh  were  developed  those  powers  aspastor  and  preacher  which  made  the  futurecareer  so  fruitful.  It  was  the  habit  of  the  littleBelfast  student  circle,  when  members  of  it  metto  say  half-playfully  to  each  other,  "Now,  preachgood  sermons!"  More  than  once  my  father  hadoccasion  to  emphasize  the  character  of  the  congregation,  as  one  exceedingly  helpful  and  stimulating.  Many  of  those  living  in  the  city  werethoughtful  and  highly  educated  people.  On  thisaccount  the  substance  of  the  sermon  had  to  besuch  as  would  edify  them,  while  the  style  andmanner  had  to  be  simple  enough  for  the  thoughtto  be  grasped  by  busy  farmers  and  their  tired92       THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGHwives,  whose  opportunities  for  enlarging  theirvision  were  limited.To  one  member  of  that  congregation  my  fatherfelt  himself  deeply  indebted  on  many  accounts.He  was  a  physician  of  high  character  and  of  eminent  professional  skill.  He  was  more  over  a  manof  culture,  and  old  enough  to  speak  in  a  fatherlyway  to  the  young  preacher.  Profoundly  attachedto  his  minister,  his  years  enabled  him  to  give  manya  helpful  piece  of  advice.  This  doctor  in  theprovidence  of  God  was  the  means  of  saving  the  lifeof  the  third  boy,  and  in  gratitude  for  this,  and  manyother  services,  the  present  writer  bears  his  name.The  need  of  the  congregation  was  a  closertouch  with  the  outlying  regions  dependent  on  theChurch.  At  once  my  father  began  that  systematic  visiting  which  marked  his  ministerial  lifethroughout.  He  was  in  the  habit  of  announcinga  prayer-meeting  in  one  of  these  districts  on  a  certain  day  and  hour,  having  arranged  with  somehousehold  for  the  use  of  their  largest  room.  Thenhe  visited  round  about  all  the  day,  often  taking  hissupper  at  some  of  the  houses,  spoke  at  the  prayer-meeting,  encouraged  the  people  to  attend  regularlythe  Sunday  services,  and  then  made  his  way  home.The  note-books  of  those  days  are  filled  withsuch  entries  as,  "Visit  in  Moneypatrick  andTHE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGH       93preach  same  evening  at  house  of  Mr.   ,  homeat  eleven."  These  prayer-meetings  and  extrapreaching  services  were  at  first  criticised  as"Methodist"  and  quite  "  un-Presbyterian,"  butthe  results  were  soon  seen  in  the  gallery  as  wellas  on  the  floor  of  the  Church,  and  week  afterweek  the  congregations  grew  steadily  andquietly,  but  with  permanent  strength.  In  all  elsemy  father's  methods  were  inclined  to  be  a  littleunsystematic.  He  had  a  remarkable  memory,and  could  afford  to  trust  it  where  others  wouldhave  used  some  system.  In  his  visiting,  however,from  the  beginning  he  kept  careful  records  andworked  with  steady  and  persistent  system.In  his  later  years  he  sometimes  remarked  that  thedifficulty  of  pastoral  visitation  had  changed.  In  theArmagh  days  he  needed  tact  and  resource  to  prevent  his  visitation  being  purely  official  ministerialand  professional.  In  those  days  it  was  expectedthat  the  children  should  be  questioned,  and  saytheir  catechism,  and  then  the  minister  prayed  withthe  household.  In  addition  to  this  he  desired  tocome  as  a  friend,  to  share  the  social  life  and  knowthe  real  needs  of  those  to  whom  he  ministered.  Inhis  later  life  the  difficulty  was  the  other  way.  Heneeded  tact  and  resource  to  give  his  visiting  the  ministerial  and  spiritual  significance  he  coveted  fork.94       THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGHThe  wave  of  religious  life  that  had  swept  overEngland  and  Scotland  reached  Ireland  somewhatlater,  but  from  time  to  time  the  feeling  arose  ofnew  spiritual  needs  and  of  aroused  spiritualhunger.  Such  an  era  followed  the  famine.  Theattempt  was  made  in  Ireland  to  carry  the  Gospelto  all  classes.  In  this  work  the  young  preachertook  a  deep  interest,  and  the  correspondence  of1853  shows  how  active  a  part  he  took.  Publicmeetings  in  behalf  of  the  South  of  Ireland  wereheld.  These  meetings  were  at  times  stormy.  Ina  letter  to  his  friend  Matthew  Kerr  dated  August1 7th,  1853,  he  writes:  "The  effect  of  the  proceedings  in  the  South  (the  political  outrages  becoming  more  and  more  common  at  that  time)  onour  efforts  in  the  North  is  bad.  We  had  goodorder  in  Armagh  till  last  Friday  night  when  wewere  regularly  mobbed  here!  This  renders  theeffort  unsavory  with  our  fashionables;  but  itwould  never  do  to  give  violence  a  victory,  so  wetry  it  again  next  Friday."  Later  letters  speak  ofthe  "complete  triumph  of  the  cause"  and  oforderly  meetings  in  behalf  of  the  work  in  thesouth  of  Ireland.  The  relative  failure  of  theevangelistic  efforts  of  Protestantism  in  Ireland  isdue  to  the  fact  that  Protestantism  is  identified  inthe  minds  of  the  common  Roman  Catholic  peo-THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGH       95pie  with  an  alien  race  and  a  hostile  social  class.The  particular  meeting  that  was  mobbed  was  forthe  Hibernian  Bible  Society  whose  mission  it  wasto  circulate  the  Bible  in  the  English  tongue  amongall  classes,  and  to  carry  on  a  work  of  evangelization  among  the  Roman  Catholics.  The  vigorousand  aggressive  Protestantism  of  the  movementwas  however  tempered  by  the  kindly  sympathiesof  those  who  were  chiefly  interested.  Dr.  Edgaralways  defended  the  Connaught  Roman  Catholicseven  when  a  lawless  few  were  doing  their  worstto  bring  the  whole  countryside  into  discredit.In  once  urging  in  public  speech  the  cause  ofConnaught  Dr.  Edgar  said,  "In  acting  thuskindly  towards  the  people  of  Connaught,  youwill  only  be  imitating  the  great  kindness  whichthe  poorest  among  them  would  show  you  if  youwere  living  or  travelling  among  them.  In  themidst  of  abject  poverty  and  absolute  destitution,their  generosity  and  hospitality  are  most  affecting.  They  make  no  inquiry  whether  you  areProtestant  or  Roman  Catholic:  it  is  enough  forthem  that  you  are  a  man  and  a  stranger.  Withthem,  Stranger  is  a  holy  name,  and  whatsoevertheir  house  contains  is  at  your  service."Perhaps  also  no  Protestant  in  all  Ireland  was  atone  time  more  popular  in  his  way  among  the96       THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGHRoman  Catholics  than  Matthew  Kerr,  and  myfather,  with  a  deep-rooted  horror  of  the  errors  ashe  saw  them  of  Rome,  and  with  a  profound  persuasion  that  Protestants  were  ignorant  of  andcareless  about  the  dangers  of  Romanism,  yetsought  to  be  fair  and  generous  in  his  controversywith  them,  and  on  more  than  one  occasion  foughttheir  battle  when  he  thought  them  being  wronged.Hence,  as  generally  happens,  in  such  cases,  hewas  in  spite  of  his  sturdy  Protestantism  believedin  and  greatly  respected  by  his  Roman  Catholicfellow-citizens.In  pursuance  of  the  missionary  purpose  so  recently  implanted  in  the  reinvigorated  life  of  thechurch  in  Ireland,  literary  matter  was  in  demand.Hence  in  1855  my  father  took  charge  of  TheChildren's  Missionary  Herald,  and  carried  it  onuntil  1860,  when  he  gave  it  into  the  hands  of  hisfriend  Matthew  Kerr,  that  he  might  be  free  foranother  literary  enterprise  along  the  same  butlarger  lines  in  Dublin.  In  the  October  number,in  1858,  was  reprinted,  bad  spelling  and  all,  a  letterreceived  from  one  of  his  Connaught  pupils  whohad  gone  to  America.  The  writer  of  the  letter,a  mere  lad  when  he  left  Ireland,  sent  for  hisfather  and  mother,  and  later  for  his  whole  family.The  letter  is  in  part  as  follows:  "I  wonder  ifTHE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGH       97you  have  forgotten  me.  I  have  been  wishing  tohear  or  get  a  few  lines  from  you.  You  are  asfresh  upon  my  mind  as  when  I  left  Camlin.  Othe  kindness  you  bestowed  on  me — the  pains  youtook  in  instructing  me,  when  I  was  young  andinexperienced.  If  I  was  to  see  you  face  to  face,I  would  be  able  to  tell  you  how  thankful  I  am  toyou.  It  is  often  when  I  am  wandring  throughthis  wilderness  of  a  country  I  pray  that  the  blessing  of  God  might  be  with  you,  and  if  it  pleaseGod  that  I  might  see  you  here  on  earth,  I  will  beable  to  tell  you  how  happy  I  sometimes  feel,  andmay  the  Lord  grant  that  we  may  well  prepare  forthat  hour  which  no  man  knoweth  save  Himabove.  My  dear  friend,  though  the  rowling  seasare  between  us,  do  remember  me  and  pray  forme.  ...  In  reguard  to  our  living,  we  have  asgood  a  living  hear  as  the  richest  man  in  thatcountry.  ...  I  kept  your  last  letter  in  mypocket  till  it  crumbled  away.  If  I  mistake  notyou  asked  me  what  church  I  belong  to,  I  atachmyself  to  the  Methodest  Church  in   ,  but  Ihave  a  great  liking  for  all  Christian  people."Some  twelve  years  later  my  father  did  visit  in  thewest  of  America  the  prosperous  and  well-to-doman,  whom  he  had  taught  as  a  poor  half-starvedcowherd  in  the  wilds  of  Connaught.98       THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGHIn  Armagh  were  born  all  the  children  save  onedaughter,  born  in  Dublin,  and  besides  the  responsibility  of  his  own  family  there  fell  on  theshoulders  of  the  eldest  son  the  additional  burdenof  his  younger  brothers  and  sisters.  Cheerfullyand  lovingly  all  his  life  he  was,  as  his  youngestsister  testified,  more  of  a  father  than  a  brother  tothem  all.Very  early  the  parents  in  dedicating  their  eldestson  to  the  ministry  had  desired  that  he  should  goas  a  foreign  missionary,  when  the  failing  healthof  the  father  made  it  apparent  that  the  eldest  sonwould  have  more  than  usual  responsibility.William  Hall  had  said,  "  we  cannot  spare  John,he  must  take  my  place,"  and  this  with  lovingfidelity  and  extraordinary  wisdom  for  so  young  ahead  the  eldest  son  did  even  in  school  and  college  days.In  Armagh  he  had  the  advantage  of  beingnearer  to  the  old  home  where  his  mother  andbrothers  and  sisters  were,  an  advantage  not  to  bedespised  in  the  days  of  slow  and  imperfect  communication.  The  journey  to  the  General  Assembly  was  in  those  days  a  solemn  undertaking,and  one  who  had  been  to  England  was  a  far-travelled  man.What  widened  considerably  however  the  ho-THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGH       99rizon  in  evangelical  circles  was  the  missionaryliterature,  with  maps  of  far-off  lands,  and  accountsof  strange  races  and  foreign  ways.  It  would  beinteresting  to  know  how  much  England's  colonies  owe  to  the  missionary  literature  and  missionary  efforts  that  awakened  a  curiosity  in  theminds  of  many  young  adventurers  whose  aimsin  travelling  were  not  always  the  same  as  themissionaries  who  first  gave  the  impulse  tojourney  forth  from  the  native  place.In  another  direction  my  father's  energies  werethrown  at  this  time.  Even  in  college  he  had  belonged  to  a  temperance  circle,  and  now  he  flunghis  influence  against  one  of  the  curses  of  Irishsociety,  the  excessive  drinking  of  intoxicatingspirits.  Some  of  the  best  temperance  tracts  ofthat  date  are  from  his  pen,  and  one  or  two  hadan  enormous  circulation.  This  movement  wasnot  popular.  Many  of  the  wealthiest  Presbyterians  made  money  in  the  traffic.  There  was  nosentiment  against  the  trade,  and  the  conservativeelements  saw  in  the  position  taken  a  reflectionupon  the  generation  that  had  harmlessly  indulgedin  the  social  glass.  In  spite  of  the  offense  he  ofnecessity  gave,  my  father  continued  steadily  inseason  and  out  of  season  to  urge  temperance.  Aconstant  entry  in  his  day-book  is,  "spoke  at  aioo     THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGHtemperance  meeting  in  the  township  A.,"  or"urged  temperance  at  the  church  of  ...  ,"and  one  time  he  notes  the  fact  "exceeded  thedue  limits  of  an  address  by  speaking  an  hourand  three-quarters  on  temperance."  In  afterdays  he  sometimes  lamented  the  political  temperance  movement,  and  felt,  as  I  understand  Dr.Theodore  L.  Cuyler  also  feels,  that  the  originaltemperance  movement  has  been  injured  by  theidentification  of  it  with  political  prohibition.In  the  autumn  of  1 859  my  father  took  part  in  a  remarkable  religious  movement  that  was  connectedwith  the  north  of  Ireland  specially.  The  religiousawakening  excited  attention,  and  after  it  hadgone  on  for  some  little  time  abuses  began  to  bemanifest.  Against  these  my  father  and  othersraised  their  voices,  as  was  fitting,  seeing  thatthey  had  had  much  to  do  with  the  situation.Yet  many  things  took  place  which  greatly  disturbed  him.  Never  again  could  he  hail  with  thesame  zeal  movements  connected  with  excitement,  which  he  recognized  distinctly  as  physical.Indeed,  I  think,  he  was  perhaps  almost  undulyprejudiced  by  the  experiences  of  that  year  againstsimilar  movements  later  on.  He  wrote  a  letterto  the  Armagh  Guardian,  which  is  especiallyinteresting,  because  it  so  exactly  reflects  his  feel-THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGH     101ings  all  through  his  life.    The  letter  was  as  follows:Armagh,zist  September,  1859.DEAR  SIR,—  In  the  present  deeply  interesting  state  of  aportion  of  the  people  of  Armagh,  may  I  venture  to  suggest  toreflecting  persons  a  few  things  that  require  to  be  considered  ?1.  When  tourists,  clerical  or  otherwise,  come  to  the  place,will  it  be  wise  to  exhibit  to  them  persons  believed  to  have  beenvisited  by  the  Spirit  of  God  ?     In  the  nature  of  things  this  canonly  be  done   with  those  most  likely  to  suffer,  either  by  beingtempted  to  self-complacency,  or  as  has  occurred  elsewhere,  tomaking  a  gain  of  godliness  ?     Should  not  intelligent  persons  besatisfied  with  their  observations  at  meetings,  and  with  the  information  afforded  them  ?     Who  would  covet  a  gratification  atthe  risk  of  doing  mischief  in  such  a  case  ?2.  Should  young  persons  be  put  forward  to  speak  in  public,because  recently  converted  ?  what  principle  is  in  the  apostolicwords  ( I  Tim.  3:6)  "  not  a  novice,  lest  being  lifted  up  withpride,  he  fall  into,  etc.  "  ?     Would  it  not  be  much  better  to  givesound  scriptural  instruction  to  these  deeply  interesting  youngpersons  ?3.  Should  any  attention  be  given  to  dreams,  trances,  etc.,  ifthey  appear  here  ?     Should  they  not  be  treated  as  trifles  to  saythe  least  of  them,  as  compared  with  the   real  work  of  God'sSpirit  ?4.  Should  young  people  be  encouraged  to  protracted  meetings  especially  where  no  minister  is  presiding  ?     Or  would  itnot  be  better  to  have  meetings  shorter  and  earlier,  and  if  necessary  to  close  business  places  earlier  to  give  facility  to  attend  ?Will  not  employers  gain  by  any  really  good  influence  on  theemployed  ?5.  Can  much  good  be  expected  from  mass  meetings  and  excursion  trains  ?     Would  not  the  temptation  to  mere  ephemeralexcitement  be  more  likely  to  abound  on  such  occasions  than  inthe  quiet  enjoyment  of  the  ordinary  means  of  grace  ?

Adeep  interest  in  the  Lord's  work  in  Armagh  induces  me  tosubmit  the  above  questions  to  readers  of  your  paper,  to  whoseminds  they  may  not  otherwise  have  been  carried. — Believe  me,faithfully  yours,  J.  H.With  a  growing  family  and  a  good  manycares,  with  an  ever-increasing  weight  of  responsibility  in  ecclesiastical  matters,  and  a  great  dealof  hard  drudging  work,  my  father  yet  alwayslooked  back  to  the  days  spent  in  Armagh  asamong  the  most  profitable  and  happiest  of  hisministry.In  the  meantime  the  fame  as  a  preacher  of  theyoung  Armagh  minister  was  spreading.  InAugust,  1856,  he  had  made  a  short  trip  to  Scotland  and  preached  for  an  acquaintance  in  Glasgow.  He  had  hardly  returned  to  Ireland  beforeovertures  were  made  to  him  looking  towards  hisremoval  to  Scotland.  But  in  spite  of  the  attractive  nature  of  several  such  overtures  then,  as  alsolater  in  his  career,  he  felt  that  Scotland  was  wellprovided  for,  and  that  his  duty  lay  elsewhere.In  spite  of  the  heavy  duties  of  the  ArmaghTHE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGH     103pastorate  outside  interests  were  not  neglected.Nearly  every  season  a  tour  was  made  in  the  interests  of  the  Deaf  and  Dumb  Institution  ofUlster.  The  Hibernian  Bible  Society  had  also  aclaim  on  his  time,  and  he  was  frequently  calledupon  to  plead  its  claims  elsewhere  than  in  hisown  church.  To  the  militia  of  Armagh  he  alsoacted  as  chaplain,  and  a  list  of  the  Protestantswas  carefully  kept  by  him,  and  they  were  visitedas  regularly  as  his  parishioners.The  prayers  of  the  years  1855  to  1857  aboundwith  references  to  England's  sacrifices  in  theCrimea  and  the  Indian  Mutiny.  In  those  daysit  was  my  father's  habit  to  write  prayers  whicheither  opened  or  closed  the  sermon,  and  severallonger  prayers  exist  which  he  had  written  out  infull.  In  these  the  soldiers  fighting  under  distantskies  were  specially  remembered,  for  the  eldeststepson  had  gone  as  a  young  officer  to  learn  theart  of  war.  This  step  was  taken  just  in  time  tosee  the  closing  scenes  of  the  Indian  Mutiny1857-1858,  and  as  a  mother's  heart  followed  thenews  of  England's  struggle,  earnest  prayers  forthe  soldier's  safety  were  mingled  with  the  thanksgivings  over  tidings  of  success.  Then  as  alwaysIrish  blood  was  flowing  freely  for  the  extension  and  preservation  of  the  Empire,  and  the104     THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGHNorth  contributed  her  share  to  the  armies  sentabroad.It  was  characteristic  then  as  throughout  the  lifeof  my  father  that  he  was  not  strongly  biassedpolitically.  Naturally  belonging  to  the  liberalparty,  he  yet  took  no  active  part  in  the  politicalturmoil  of  those  days,  and  this  in  spite  of  the  factthat  nearly  all  ministers  of  influence  were  thenmore  or  less  inclined  to  political  activity.  Dr.Cooke  had  been  as  successful  as  a  politician  as  hehad  been  as  a  preacher,  and  many  undertook  toimitate  his  political  methods  without  his  judgment  or  his  ability.  Along  this  line  my  fathernever  seems  to  have  been  tempted.  Neither  atthis  time  nor  later  in  life  did  he  closely  identifyhimself  with  any  political  party,  and  althoughgreat  national  interests,  such  as  national  education,  temperance  reform,  industrial  educationcalled  out  his  best  energies,  yet  it  was  alwaysdistinctly  as  a  non-partisan  liberal.Particularly  did  he  see  in  the  advance  of  Pres-byterianism  the  highest  good  of  Ireland.  Almostanxiously  does  he  canvass  the  situation  in  thecorrespondence  of  1857  and  1858.  The  reason  ofthis  anxiety  was  not  far  to  seek.  The  splendidreligious  impulse  that  had  given  the  Irish  Presbyterian  Church  some  of  her  best  leaders  was  inTHE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGH     105danger  apparently  of  giving  way  to  a  satisfied  reaction.  The  older  men  were  either  passingaway,  or  were  no  longer  in  touch  with  newwants  constantly  arising  on  the  horizon.  Theconditions,  also,  in  Ireland  had  materially  changed.The  loss  of  upwards  of  two  millions  of  her  population  between  1846  and  1856  had  made  Irelandin  many  respects  a  different  country.  The  Northactually  prospered  under  the  changed  conditions,for  famine  hardly  touched  her,  and  her  shippingtrade  and  cattle  export  were  greatly  improved.At  the  same  time  the  changed  conditions  affectedunfavorably — at  least  such  was  the  judgment  ofmany  at  the  time — the  higher  interests.  Particularly  in  Dublin  did  the  leading  men  feel  the  difficulty  of  the  situation.  The  correspondencebetween  Dr.  Hamilton  Magee  and  his  friendsdisclose  some  of  the  difficulties  under  which  thereligious  work  of  the  Church  was  done.  At  thistime  the  leading  Presbyterian  Church  in  Dublinwas  called  Scotts  church,  Mary's  Abbey.  Dr.William  B.  Kirkpatrick  was  the  honored  andscholarly  minister.  He  however  felt,  togetherwith  others,  that  his  strength  was  not  equal  tothe  holding  of  the  congregation,  and  at  the  sametime  doing  the  work  expected  of  the  minister  ofsuch  a  church  outside.io6     THE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGHDr.  Kirkpatrick  was  a  student  rather  than  aman  of  affairs  and  under  these  circumstances  heand  the  congregation  began  to  look  about  for  onewho  should  become  with  him  a  fellow-ministerin  the  work  of  the  Church.The  choice  fell  at  once  upon  the  Armagh  minister.  Yet  the  grave  question  arose  how  anychange  could  be  made  to  seem  right  under  theexisting  conditions.  Financially  such  a  chargein  Dublin  had  no  attractions,  as  the  First  Armaghwas  abundantly  able  and  willing  to  provide  faithfully  for  its  minister,  and  a  divided  responsibilitycan  never  seem  as  hopeful  as  where  one  is  in  thedefinite  leadership.  The  situation  was  suchhowever  that  the  call  was  extended,  and  great  influence  was  brought  to  bear  upon  my  father  tocause  him  to  go  to  Dublin  for  the  sake  of  theChurch  at  large.  The  leaders  in  Belfast  also  tookthis  view  of  the  case,  and  gave  their  help  in  persuading  the  Church  at  Armagh  of  the  wisdom  ofthe  change.It  was  in  many  ways  a  sore  trial  to  the  wholefamily.  Armagh  had  become  dear  to  both  husband  and  wife  as  the  birthplace  of  their  children.The  old  manse  was  a  real  home  ;  no  kinder  people  did  they  ever  know  than  the  Armagh  friendsof  my  parent's  first  ministry  ;  and  in  some  waysTHE  MINISTRY  IN  ARMAGH     107it  was  even  a  pecuniary  sacrifice  to  accept  theplace.  At  the  same  time  my  father  felt  that  theunited  judgments  of  so  many  demanded  fromhim  an  affirmative  decision,  and  with  heavy  hearthe  said  at  last,  "  Yes  "  to  the  invitation  to  go  toMary's  Abbey.  The  birth  of  the  youngest  son  inSeptember,  1858,  made  the  removal  of  the  familyonly  possible  in  October,  but  a  few  weeks  before  that  definite  leave  was  taken  of  the  kind  andprosperous  congregation  who  felt  sorely  the  lossof  one  they  had  come  to  tenderly  love.  Thefuture  relationships  between  the  Church  and  theformer  pastor  remained  ever  most  tender,  andit  was  always  with  warm  enthusiasm  that  thecongregation  was  spoken  of  in  the  family  circle.V.

THE  "EVANGELICAL  WITNESS."DISESTABLISHMENT  tAND  THE  MODERATORSHIP.  DELEGATETO  AMERICA.THE  call  of  the  congregation  of  Mary's  Abbeyis  dated  the  28th  of  June,  1858,  and  thearrangement  included  a  division  of  the  preachinglabors  between  Dr.  Kirkpatrick  and  the  new  associate  minister.  The  pastoral  and  other  workwas  to  be  divided  as  best  suited  both  ministers,and  the  division  of  labor  aimed  at  giving  bothincumbents  time  for  work  outside  the  immediatechurch,  Dr.  Kirkpatrick  being  engaged  in  literaryand  particularly  apologetic  and  polemic  theology,while  the  younger  strength  was  engaged  in  outside  work  with  reference  to  the  Church  as  awhole.  No  formal  arrangement  was  made.  Thecall  was  extended  as  the  usual  call  to  a  ministerfrom  the  congregation,  no  reference  being  evenmade  to  the  relations  to  Dr.  Kirkpatrick.  Inspite  of  the  strenuous  efforts  of  the  two  men,whose  warm  friendship  lasted  through  the  life-ii2  THE  MINISTRY  INtime  of  Dr.  Kirkpatrick,  the  arrangement  hadmany  disadvantages,  and  did  not  work  well.With  men  less  absorbed  in  the  great  interests  involved,  and  in  even  slight  degree  thinking  ofthemselves  the  plan  would  not  have  worked  atall.  Scholarly,  thoughtful  and  refined  as  werethe  sermons  of  the  older  preacher,  they  lackedthe  popular  clearness,  and  the  warmth  that  madethe  younger  man's  ministrations  acceptable  to  amuch  larger  number.  Dr.  Kirkpatrick  rejoicedin  the  success  of  the  new  voice,  but  it  was  notin  his  power  to  prevent  unkind  things  being  saidby  mischief-makers  who  would  have  gladly  seentrouble  between  the  two  friends.  The  personalrelations  were  however  too  sincere  and  toogenuine  to  be  thus  disturbed.  On  Saturdaynights  they  met  together  for  prayer  and  study,  andmany  times  my  father  has  spoken  to  me  gratefullyof  the  spiritual  and  intellectual  stimulus  gainedin  those  meetings  together.  At  the  same  time  theexperiment  was  one  he  never  desired  to  try  again.Mary's  Abbey  filled  up  rapidly,  and  in  spite  ofa  location  altogether  unfavorable,  and  a  buildingfar  from  meeting  the  needs  of  the  congregation,the  prosperity  was  apparent  and  real.  In  Dublinthe  same  restless  energy  and  power  of  unceasingwork  was  displayed  that  had  marked  the  pastorateMARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN          113in  Armagh.  As  chaplain  to  Mountjoy  FemalePrison  a  great  variety  of  human  wants  and  woeshad  to  be  met  and  mastered.  The  weeks  werefew  in  which  some  article,  tract  or  open  letterdid  not  appear.  The  Children's  MissionaryHerald  was  given  up  in  1860,  but  only  to  makepossible  the  editing  of  the  Evangelical  Witness,a  monthly  religious  paper  started  shortly  after,and  which  my  father  continued  to  edit  until  heleft  Dublin.  To  the  outside  activities  of  thechurch  he  devoted  now  a  great  deal  of  time.The  evangelization  of  the  West  lay  on  his  heart;the  institutions  for  the  orphans  and  the  deaf  andblind  needed  sermons  and  addresses  to  which  hedevoted  much  labor  going  from  place  to  placeuntil  his  voice  and  tall  figure  crowned  by  deepblack  hair  was  familiar  in  every  little  town  in  thenorth  and  middle  west  of  Ireland,  and  his  name  wasnow  known  to  Protestants  all  over  the  country.He  was  especially  now  sought  as  a  temperanceadvocate.  It  was  at  that  time  neither  usual  norpopular  for  all  clergymen  to  be  pronouncedly  onthe  side  of  temperance.  Many  a  kindly  warningdid  my  father  receive  of  the  "injudicious  "  temperance  agitation  to  which  he  was  addicted.This  was  more  especially  the  case  because  powerful  Presbyterian  interests  were  directly  or  in-u4  THE  MINISTRY  INdirectly  engaged  in  the  traffic.  To  the  greatcredit  of  those  interests  be  it  said  that  in  noquarters  were  my  father's  outspoken  statementsof  his  convictions  more  generously  received.Those  whom  timid  counsellors  feared  he  wouldoffend,  admired  him  for  his  courage  and  faithfulness,  even  where  they  were  not  convinced  by  hisarguments  or  won  by  his  persuasions,  and  became  his  lifelong  friends.Among  the  many  open  questions  in  Irelandremains  still  that  of  education.  The  difficulty  isone  of  ideals.  The  Roman  Catholic  Church  cannotbe  content  with  anything  less  than  full  control,and  this  means,  in  the  experience  of  the  Protestant  elements  a  dangerous  popular  ignorance.  Atthe  same  time  the  Protestants  are  themselves  divided.  The  Episcopal  Church  has  an  educationalideal  not  shared  by  the  Presbyterians.  The  questions  at  issue  were  even  more  sharply  debatedbefore  the  disestablishment  of  the  Church  in  Ireland  in  1 869- 1 87 1.1  It  was  as  early  as  1831  thatas  a  result  of  the  work  of  an  educational  inquiry  aBoard  of  National  Education  was  established,with  commissioners  from  various  faiths.21  The  bill  was  passed  by  Mr.  Gladstone,  the  26th  of  July,  andtook  effect  on  Jan.  ist,  1871."The  first  religious  census  in  Ireland  was  taken  in  1834,  andaccording  to  it  the  population  was  divided  as  follows  :MARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN          115The  Board  was  at  once  furiously  attacked  bythe  Orange  and  extreme  Episcopalian  (Church  ofIreland)  interests.  This  was  a  most  happy  providence,  for  this  fact  drew  temporarily  to  theBoard's  aid  the  Roman  Catholic  sympathy.  Inaccordance  with  directions  from  the  governmentthe  education  was  to  be  wholly  non-sectarian,The  Established  Church     .     .     .  852,064Roman  Catholics     6,427,712Presbyterians     642,356Other  Protestant  Dissenters    .     .  21,8087.943.940This  census  was  probably  grossly  inaccurate.  Dr.  Killen  impugns  it  in  Reid's  history  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  as  misrepresenting  the  proportions  (cf.  vol.  Ill,  page  499,  Ed.  1853).But  in  the  writer's  opinion,  it  also  grossly  exaggerates  the  totalpopulation,  and  is  untrustworthy  as  giving  data  for  computation  ofthe  number  in  Ireland.  In  1871  an  accurate  census  was  takenwith  the  following  results  :Episcopalians     683,295Presbyterians     503,461Methodists     41,81  cIndependents     4,485Baptists     4(643Society  of  Friends     3,834Roman  Catholics     4,141,933Thus  Protestantism  had  in  1871,  1,260,568  and  Roman  Catholicism  about  four  times  that  number.  Of  course  famine  andemigration  weakened  both  Protestantism  and  Roman  Catholicism,  but  Roman  Catholicism  suffered  far  more  than  Protestantism.n6  THE  MINISTRY  INthe  reading  of  the  Scripture  was  not  to  be  enforcedon  unwilling  children,  but  in  accordance  with  thewishes  of  parents,  religious  teachers  of  variousfaiths  were  to  have  opportunity  given  them  forthe  instruction  in  religion  as  favored  by  theparents.As  up  to  this  time  Episcopal  parish  ministershad  had  a  most  offensive  power  of  interferencewith  schools,  established  and  maintained  byprivate  means  in  large  part,  and  wholly  attendedby  those  of  another  faith,  the  extreme  party  inthe  Church  resented  fiercely  the  establishment  ofthe  Commission.  It  was,  in  fact,  the  beginningof  the  end.  Step  by  step  the  power  of  the  Established  Church  was  curtailed  until  at  last  disestablishment  was  an  accomplished  fact.  One  ofthe  first  commissioners  appointed  had  been  thescholarly  and  able  minister  of  Mary's  Abbey,Dublin,  the  Rev.  Mr.  Carlile.  He  was  bothpopular  and  extremely  orthodox,  as  that  term  wasthen  used,  yet  he  was  very  nearly  subjected  tochurchly  discipline  for  accepting  the  position.Only  the  fact  of  his  very  influential  position,  andthat  there  were  hopes — afterwards  realized — thathe  would  succeed  in  changing  the  plan  of  theBoard  of  Education,  saved  his  ecclesiastical  life.For,  alas,  many  Presbyterians  were  completelyMARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN          117blind  to  the  great  step  in  advance  such  nationaleducation  really  was.  For  them  the  cry  "Godless"  and  "irreligious"  education  had  far  toomuch  weight.The  attitude  of  Dr.  H.  Cooke— the  "Cock  ofthe  North"  was  also  a  serious  embarrassment.Dr.  Cooke  was  a  Conservative  by  birth,  education  and  instinct.  The  existing  state  of  thingswas  for  him  d  priori  the  right  state  of  things.His  policy  had  been  to  work  with  the  EstablishedChurch,  and  he  had  been  a  good  deal  petted  bythe  Tory  and  High  Church  elements.  To  himTrinity  College,  Dublin  had  given  a  degree,  analmost  revolutionary  action  in  those  days.  Hesupported  always  the  candidates  set  up  by  theTory  and  landlord  interests,  so  that  Presbyterianand  Liberal  representation  was  at  that  time  impossible.  Dr.  Cooke  opposed  disestablishment,and  actually  in  1868  the  Presbyterian  Church  expressed  modified  disapproval  of  Mr.  Gladstone'sbill.  He  did  not  like  the  growing  liberal  party  inthe  Presbyterian  Church,  and  saw  in  NationalBoard  Schools  a  menace  to  the  distinctively  religious  education  which  was  his  ideal.  In  1839there  was,  it  is  true,  a  compromise  made  betweenthe  Synod  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  and  theGovernment  Board,  but  friction  was  not  whollyn8  THE  MINISTRY  INovercome.  The  difficulties  of  national  education  were  then  enormously  increased  whenafter  1848  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  reversedits  policy  and  denounced  in  unmeasured  termsthe  whole  scheme.In  1841  two  Synods  of  the  Presbyterian  faithcame  together,  and  formed  the  General  Assemblyof  the  Presbyterian  Church  in  Ireland.  From  thattime  on  Presbyterian  Liberalism  began  to  workitself  free  from  the  leadership  of  Tory  Protestantism.  Yet  the  change  was  a  gradual  one.  Thiswas  in  part  in  deference  to  Dr.  Cooke.  Thestruggle  over  national  education  was  still  goingon  in  1858  when  my  father  went  to  Dublin.  Ashas  been  remarked  he  was  no  politician,  yet  hewas  a  Liberal,  and  a  rather  pronounced  Liberal  onthe  education  question.  The  older  men  lookedto  the  coming  younger  man  with  much  of  hope.The  stalwart  and  evangelical  orthodoxy  of  thenew  voice  that  was  being  heard  over  all  Irelandgreatly  encouraged  those  who  dreaded  the  dead-ness  of  a  past  era.  Unfortunately  however  theolder  orthodoxy  was  lukewarm  in  the  matter  ofnational  education  and  was  inclined  to  join  handswith  Tory  and  Orange  extremes  in  opposition.The  experience  in  the  west  of  Ireland  had  greatlyinterested  my  father  in  education.  He  saw  in  itMARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN          119the  one  hope  of  the  population.  He  did  notunderrate  religious  education,  but  he  did  not  seehow  there  could  by  any  chance  be  "an  Episcopalian  spelling,"  and  a  "Presbyterian  table  ofmultiplication."  He  flung  himself  boldly  on  theside  of  national  unsectarian  education.  Thenwhen  in  1860,  in  accordance  with  the  expresswish  of  the  Presbyterian  church  for  a  third  Presbyterian  commissioner  the  place  was  offered  tomy  father;  he  at  once  accepted,  and  becamequeen's  commissioner  of  national  education.  Theletter  asking  my  father  to  join  the  board  is  as  follows:Irish  Office,DEAR  SIR:ig  Nov.  f86o.When  a  deputation  of  the  Presbyterian  church  did  methe  honor  to  call  upon  me  on  the  subject  of  the  addition,  whichit  was  proposed  to  make,  to  the  board  of  education,  one  of  theprincipal  objects  which  they  had  in  view  was  to  obtain  the  addition  of  a  third  Presbyterian  commissioner.The  Lord  Lieutenant  authorizes  me  to  acquaint  you,  in  hisname  as  well  as  in  my  own,  that  the  government  are  disposedto  accede  to  their  request  and  I  beg  to  propose  to  you  to  jointhe  board,  and  give  to  it  the  sanction  of  your  name  and  yourattention.I  remain,  dear  sir,faithfully  yoursREV.

Moreover  his120  THE  MINISTRY  INvigorous  defense  of  his  position  savored  far  toomuch  of  advanced  radical  views  to  suit  thosewho  were  still  in  the  armor  put  on  for  pastconflicts.  Particularly  offensive  to  some  was  a"Very  Short  Catechism  for  Such  as  be  ofWeaker  Capacity"  which  my  father  wrote  atthis  time.  It  is  as  follows:A  VERY  SHORT  CATECHISM  FORSUCH   AS   BE   OF   WEAKER   CAPACITY.A.  Is  it  true  that  the  Bible  is  shut  out  of  theIrish  National  Schools  ?B.

Then  if  you  manage  a  school  andfix  the  hours  from  ten  to  eleven  for  Scripturereading,  would  you  say  the  Scriptures  are  notused  in  school  hours  ?A.  Certainly  not.

It  was  a  defense  of  the  systemMARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN          127of  national  education  in  Ireland  and  was  headed,"  What  is  '  Godless  '  Education  ?  ""  '  Godless'  is  not  a  complimentary  adjective.Even  the  man  whom  it  accurately  describes  doesnot  wish  it  applied  to  him.  A  'godless''wife,'  a  'godless'  'community,'  are  undesirable  associations.  To  fasten  the  term  to  man  orthing  is  to  raise  a  strong  prejudice  against  thatman  or  that  thing.  One  may  be,  by  commonconsent,  a  practical  atheist  and  yet  unwilling  toappropriate  this  reproachful  epithet."Rome  has  tried  to  fasten  the  epithet,  'godless,'  on  all  education  that  she  does  not  direct,and  to  raise  a  prejudice  against  it.  A  true  andstrong  human  instinct  demands  that  educationshould  take  account  of  God,  and  revolts  from  anythat  ignores  Him.  It  is  clever,  therefore,  if  itwere  only  also  honest,  to  stigmatize  any  education  which  the  Church  does  not  direct  as  godless.*****"Now,  let  us  see.  Is  this  the  ground  of  hercomplaint  ?  The  British  Government  set  up  asystem  of  schools  and  colleges  where  the  bestavailable  teachers  should  give  all  denominationssecular  learning  in  common;  where,  at  separatehours  and  in  separate  places,  the  clergy  or  otherreligious  teachers  approved  by  the  parents  should128  THE  MINISTRY  INcome  and  teach  each  his  own  co-religionists  asmuch  of  his  religion  as  they  pleased.  The  Episcopalian  can  then  have  Bible  and  prayer-book,the  Roman  Catholic  his  catechism  and  prayer-books,  or  any  religious  books  he  will,  and  thePresbyterian  his  Bible  and  Shorter  Catechism.The  only  two  rules  are  that  no  one  shall  be  denied  secular  education  on  religious  grounds,  andno  one  shall  be  forced  to  learn  tenets  opposed  tohis  own  religion.  But  each  denomination  maymake  its  own  youth  as  '  godly '  as  it  can.  Thisseems  fair  and  unobjectionable  all  round.  Butthis  was  the  very  system  that  had  the  term  '  godless  '  applied  to  it,  and  which  is  still  denouncedand  disliked  by  Roman  Catholic  ecclesiastics,though  the  laity  have  shown  their  estimate  of  itsvalue  to  their  children."On  this  plan,  under  a  Board  of  equal  numbersof  Roman  Catholic  and  Protestant  noblemen  andgentlemen,  the  British  House  of  Commons  is  expending  nearly  $2,000,000  a  year  in  Ireland,  butit  is  in  continual  practical  war  with  the  ecclesiastics,  who  clamor,  under  every  variety  of  plea,for  a  separate  allowance  of  money — to  be  laidout  by  themselves.  That  the  high  officers,  theinspectors,  the  managers  of  the  training  schools,are  appointed  with  due  regard  to  denominationalMARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN          129representation,  is  nothing;  that  the  books  haveeverything  offensive  to  any  denomination  excluded,  is  nothing;  that  history  is  excluded  because  history  is  hard  to  teach  without  touchingreligion,  is  nothing;  that  the  Roman  Catholicpriest  appoints  the  teacher,  superintends  him,  andcan  dismiss  him — all  this  is  nothing; — the  systemis  under  condemnation,  and  the  cry  from  'theChurch  '  is  for  a  'separate  grant.'"We  doubt  if  any  government  ever  made  amore  honest  effort  to  educate  a  nation  than  thatwhich  is  conferring  inestimable  blessings  onIreland,  and  no  one  thing  has  excited  deeper  regret  among  all  true  and  intelligent  lovers  of  thatland  and  its  people — among  whom  the  writerclaims  a  place — than  the  persistent  Papal  opposition  which  has  retarded,  though  it  has  notcrushed,  the  educational  advancement  of  thepeople."  It  is  idle  to  allege  that  infidelity  springs  out  ofall  education  which  'the  Church'  does  notdirect.  Romish  countries  have  as  many  infidelsas  Protestant.  As  many  people — proportionally—in  Spain,  France,  and  Italy,  disregard  God  asoffered  by  Roman  Catholic  teaching,  as  may  befound  in  Protestant  lands  disregarding  God  as130  THE  MINISTRY  INProtestantism  worships  Him.  This  fact  noone  can  deny.  It  was  not  Protestantism  thatinoculated  France  with  infidelity."  It  is  nothing  to  the  point  to  parade  the  oldargument  that  as  the  oldest  colleges,  like  Oxford,were  founded  by  Roman  Catholics,  therefore,  thesystem  must  be  favorable  to  learning.  It  wasnot  for  popular  education  they  were  erected,  butfor  the  education  of  the  clergy  and  such  as  couldafford  to  pay  well  for  education.  Nor  can  theChurch  claim  much  honor  for  originating  these.The  greatest  friend  of  education,  for  many  ages,was  Charlemagne,  who,  by  imperial  enactment,ordained  that  bishops  should  erect  schools  neartheir  churches  and  that  monks  should  have  themin  their  monasteries.  How  much  external  poweris  needed  to  stimulate  Romish  ecclesiastics  in  thisdirection,  might  be  inferred  from  the  fact  thatthe  more  bishops  and  monks  in  any  country,  asa  rule,  the  worse  educated  are  the  people.  Onthe  other  hand,  nowhere  are  the  masses  of  Roman  Catholic  people  so  well  educated  as  wherethey  live  among  Protestants  and  under  Protestantinstitutions."  Roman  Catholics  themselves  have  an  interestin  this  question.  They  have  derived  immensebenefit  from  the  common  schools,  and  could  notMARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN          131gain  anything — if  all  history  is  not  a  cheat — fromtheir  transfer,  in  any  greater  measure,  to  theChurch.  The  whole  community  would  be  aloser,  for  it  is  for  the  public  good  that  the  peopleof  different  kindreds  and  tongues  peopling  thisfair  and  broad  land  should  coalesce  and  becomeone;  and,  if  any  denomination  has  reason  tothink  its  youth  less  instructed  in  religion  than  isfit,  surely  patriotic  and  candid  men  can  findmeans  to  supplement  the  existing  system.  It  ispoor  policy  to  pull  down  a  good  house  for  thesake  of  putting  in  an  additional  window."This  shows  the  pronouncedly  liberal  positiontaken  in  days  when  religious  toleration  had  beentoo  much  the  monopoly  of  Quakers  and  Unitarians.  In  fact  the  hearty  support  that  the  Unitarians  had  given  to  the  national  education  plansof  the  government  had  formed  one  reason  forthe  suspicion  in  some  Presbyterian  quarters.The  Presbyterian  Church  in  Ireland  has  longsince  begun  to  realize  how  important  a  step  wastaken  at  that  time,  and  is  also  slowly  awakeningto  the  fact  that  larger  views  must  be  taken  ofProtestant  opportunity,  and  Protestant  inspirations.The  cry  was  raised  that  the  PresbyterianLiberals  were  working  hand  in  hand  with  the1 32  THE  MINISTRY  IN"  papists,"  and  that  they  were  destructive  radicalsetc.,  etc.  Against  these  charges  my  father  wrotesharply  and  clearly,  and  did  much  to  clear  the  airand  define  the  issues  at  stake.  Rational  and  prudent  as  seem  his  counsels  now,  in  those  daysthey  excited  the  bitterest  feelings  on  the  part  ofsome  of  his  natural  friends  and  allies,  the  theologically  conservative.  He  was  accused  of  "trimming,"  "working  with  both  parties,"  and  becausehe  realized  that  a  divided  Protestantism  meantpermanent  disability  he  was  accused  of  seekingpeace  at  the  price  of  "convictions  "  as  some  dignified  their  poor  little  narrow  prejudices.At  last  my  father  came  out  with  a  definite  attack  on  the  Tory  tactics.  In  a  rather  long  articlereviewing  the  situation,  he  asked  unpleasantquestions  about  the  real  meaning  of  Tory  complaints  against  the  national  schools.  The  articlewas  regarded  as  an  attack  upon  the  long  timepractice  of  acting  as  a  tail  to  the  Tory  kite  in  thesupposed  interests  of  Protestantism,  and  moreparticularly  as  the  article  took  definite  issue  withthe  Orange  Lodge  and  denounced  its  pettycriticisms  of  Protestantism's  enlarging  horizon.He  was  then  bitterly  attacked,  these  political  attacks  did  not  weaken  my  father's  position  as  apreacher.MARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN          133The  "common  people  heard  him  gladly"  andcrowded  congregations  made  Mary's  Abbey  altogether  too  small  and  too  unimportant  a  building  for  the  uses  of  the  church.  It  was  veryearnestly  desired  to  have  Presbyterianism  properly  represented  in  Dublin.  In  fact  the  importance  of  this  was  felt  on  every  hand.  As  long  asPresbyterianism  was  a  local  issue  concerning  onlyBelfast  it  could  not  do  its  work  or  command  thesupport  needed  in  spreading  the  gospel.  Thecongregation  did  not  feel,  however,  strongenough  to  undertake  the  raising  of  a  newbuilding.  Just  at  this  time  Mr.  AlexanderFindlater  came  forward  and  offered  to  put  upthe  building,  if  the  congregation  would  secure  asuitable  site.  This  was  done  by  buying  a  corneron  Rutland  Square  where  the  building  now  stands.The  following  letter  explains  the  generous  conditions  of  the  gift  made  at  a  most  opportunetime  in  the  history  of  Dublin  Presbyterianism.Alexander  Findlater  6°  Co.,jo  Upper  Sackville  St.,Dublin,  jo  Jarfy,  1862.THE  REV.

Ihad  at  first  intended  to  have  so  far  interfered  in  the  proposedi34  THE  MINISTRY  INbuilding  as  to  employ  the  architect  and  approve  of  the  plans,and  then  to  have  left  the  matter  in  the  hands  of  the  congregation,  but  on  consideration  I  have  decided  on  refraining  entirelyfrom  all  personal  interference  in  the  work  beyond  the  contributing  the  funds,  and  the  only  authority  I  ask  to  exercise  isthe  nomination  of  a  committee  to  whom  I  will  delegate  theentire  control  of  the  business,  and  at  whose  disposal  I  willplace  the  funds  as  they  may  be  required.I  believe  that  in  my  first  communication  with  you,  I  expressed  my  readiness  to  give  ^6,000  to  .£7,000.  To  remove  alluncertainty  on  that  subject,  I  now  beg  to  say,  that  I  will  give  ifrequired  ^8,000,  and  the  only  stipulation  on  which  I  will  insist  in  return  is  that  the  ground  and  building  shall  be  given  upperfectly  free  of  debt,  so  that  the  congregation  shall  be  able  tosupport  their  ministry  liberally.Although  the  proposed  church  is  intended  primarily  for  thecongregation  of  Mary's  Abbey,  yet  my  idea  has  been,  (inwhich  I  believe  the  Presbyterian  public  concur)  that  it  shouldbe  adapted  for  meetings  of  the  General  Assembly,  and  shouldin  all  respects  by  its  architectural  appearance,  its  position  andinternal  accommodations,  be  a  building  worthy  of  the  Presbyterian  Body  in  the  Metropolis,  and  therefore  I  think  that  thecommittee  for  carrying  out  these  views,  should  not  be  composedexclusively  of  members  of  Mary's  Abbey  congregation,although  I  am  willing  that  they  should  form  the  majority.I  propose  on  the  whole  that  the  committee  shall  consist  offive,  namely,  yourself  as  chairman  (on  which  you  will  excuseme  saying  I  must  insist)  Mr.  Drury,  Dr.  Denham,  Mr.  Toddand  Mr.  Geo.

Dublinwas  growing  in  all  directions  although  not  veryrapidly  and  the  congregation  came  from  greatdistances.  It  was  my  father's  habit  to  start  out,going  from  house  to  house,  where  parishionerslived  until  he  had  reached  the  outmost  limit,when  he  would  often  take  an  outside  car  home,or  reversing  the  process  he  would  select  somefarthest  point  and  work  his  way  back  to  the  city.The  first  house  was  in  No.  45  Eccles  street,and  afterward  in  No.  n  of  the  same  street.From  the  rear  windows  of  the  last  house  theyounger  children  many  times  watched  the  roadalong  which  the  father  might  come,  often  bringing  a  few  "  sweeties,"  by  which  name  candy  wasknown  in  Ireland,  for  the  comfort  and  delectationof  the  little  ones.Many  times  in  later  life  the  remembrance  of  alarge  and  well-kept  garden  in  Dublin  was  apleasure  to  my  father.  The  head  gardener  of  theVice-regal  Lodge  was  an  old  friend  and  insisted136  THE  MINISTRY  INupon  assuming  the  charge  of  this  garden.Flowers,  and  fruits,  a  dove-cot  and  a  greenhousemade  it  an  ideal  place  for  the  children,  who  wereencouraged  to  cultivate  little  plots  of  ground  forthemselves.  Skilled  gardeners  came  regularlyand  watched  over  the  fruits  and  flowers;  fromthem  the  children  obtained  plants  and  flower-shoots  as  well  as  directions  as  to  how  theseshould  be  cared.Often  in  later  years  my  father  sighed  for  asight  of  green  from  his  study  window.  Oncehe  wrote  while  on  a  visit  to  Ireland:"Yes,  this  is  my  native  land — these  are  mynative  fields.  In  New  York,  my  eyes  are  oftenhungry  for  something  higher  than  the  top  of  awarehouse,  or  hotel,  or  church-spire,  and  something  more  simple  and  varied  than  brown  stonecut  into  fantastic  shapes.  Here  they  are  '  satisfiedwith  seeing.'  Oh  !  this  delicious  green — allgreen,  yet  not  all  the  same  green,  for  there  is  onegreen  of  the  oats,  and  another  of  the  grass,  andanother  of  the  hedges,  and  another  of  the  trees,and  another  of  the  flax,  and  over  all  'the  larksings  loud  and  high.'  I  now  find  one  good  thinghas  to  Ireland  come  through  our  Fenian  friends;and  I  cheerfully  acknowledge  it.  The  stir  theymade  led  to  the  'proclaiming'  of  wide  districts;MARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN          137and  this  rendered  the  possession  and  carrying  offire-arms  more  difficult;  and  this  led  to  thediminution  of  'gunning,'  or  'fowling,'  as  it  is  inthe  vernacular  of  Ulster;  and  this  led  to  the  increase  of  birds,  the  solemn  crow,  the  chatteringdaw,  the  long-tailed  magpie,  with  his  piebaldcoat  and  pert  manner,  and  the  dear  old  plain-coated  thrush,  Burns'  'mavis,'  and  the  equallymellow-voiced  blackbird.  And  here  in  everyhedge  is  the  robin,  not  the  great  able-bodiedrobin  of  America,  made  on  the  scale  of  the  coun-Iry,  but  the  true  robin,  no  bigger  than  the  sparrow—the  very  robin  that  covered  up  the  babes  inthe  wood  with  dry  leaves,  and  then  sung  afuneral  dirge  over  them.  Of  course  no  one  buta  brute  would  shoot  him,  in  Ireland,  where  theyknow  the  true  history  of  his  red  breast;  how  hepitied  the  world's  Redeemer  on  the  cross  andtried  in  vain  to  pull  away  the  thorns  from  hisbrow,  and  one  of  them  pricked  his  own  bosomand  the  blood  came  out,  and  the  Redeemermarked  the  well-meant  effort  of  the  little  bird,and  through  His  benediction  the  blood  stain  became  a  glory  on  his  breast  forever."But  a  little  plot  of  garden  such  as  almost  everypoorest  householder  in  Dublin  may  cherish  is  inNew  York's  wilderness  of  stone  and  brick  such138  THE  MINISTRY  INa  luxury  as  even  multi-millionaires  cannot  oftenpermit  themselves.The  summer  vacations  were  variously  spent.One  of  the  simple  pleasures  of  my  father'syounger  days  was  a  walking  trip  in  Wales.With  light  luggage,  and  living  on  the  simple  fareof  the  kindly  Welsh  people  he  walked  all  overthe  northern  and  southern  parts  of  Wales,  andretained  to  the  end  of  his  life  a  great  admiration,and  deep  regard  for  the  Welsh  people.  A  littleErse  which  he  had  picked  up  in  Connaught  helpedhim  to  make  his  wants  known  where  only  theWelsh  tongue  was  spoken.  He  also  visitedwith  my  mother  and  a  dear  friend  the  principalcontinental  cities,  travelling  in  France  and  Italyas  well  as  Switzerland.  The  vacations  wereshort,  but  in  successive  trips  he  covered  in  thisway  a  good  deal  of  ground.The  Dublin  ministry  had  many  joys  as  well  asthe  usual  trials.  The  last  addition  to  the  familycircle  was  a  little  girl  born  in  Dublin,  and  a  greatdelight  to  the  parents  in  the  midst  of  so  manyboys.  Warm  friends  and  tender  life-attachments  were  here  formed.  Moreover  the  influence  of  the  voice  in  the  pulpit  was  greatlysupplemented  by  the  writings  in  the  EvangelicalWitness,  already  mentioned  as  founded  by  myMARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN          139father  in  the  years  when  most  his  hands  seemedfull  with  a  new  church  building  in  prospect.  Itwas  a  difficult  undertaking.  Every  question  inIreland  at  that  time  was  political.  Moreover  thedivisions  among  the  Presbyterians  was  pronounced.  The  aim  of  the  Evangelical  Witnesswas  to  write  news  of  different  political  convictions  on  the  basis  of  an  honest  evangelical  Protestantism.  My  father  was  as  we  have  seenhimself  a  pronounced  Liberal,  but  he  was  nopolitician  either  secular  or  ecclesiastical.  To  himthe  success  of  evangelical  orthodoxy  was  thesupreme  end.  He  sought  to  interest  men  of  allshades  of  political  and  ecclesiastical  opinion.Hence  he  often  gave  offense  to  extremists  onboth  sides.  As  Thomas  Macnight,  so  long  aneditor  of  a  foremost  Liberal  paper  in  Belfast  haswritten  of  those  days,  "I  repeat,  therefore,  thatto  be  a  Liberal  in  Ulster  at  that  time  (1866)  wasa  very  different  thing  from  being  a  Liberal  inGreat  Britain.  It  meant  a  great  deal  more;  itmeant  often  pecuniary  loss,  loss  of  municipal  andParliamentary  honors,  loss  even  of  ordinarysocial  courtesies  from  the  great  Ulster  noblemenand  their  families,  whose  names  at  least  were  associated  with  the  old  ascendency."  But  Liberalism  was  making  steady  headway  among  the140  THE  MINISTRY  INyounger  men.  Dr.  Cooke  saw  it  and  felt  it  as  analmost  personal  grievance.  In  1866  a  movementwas  set  on  foot  to  mark  the  real  union  of  thetwo  wings  by  electing  a  Liberal  to  the  moderator-ship  of  the  General  Assembly.  Already,  however,  disestablishment  was  in  the  air.  Strenuousefforts  were  made  to  enlist  the  PresbyterianChurch  on  the  side  of  the  establishment.  Inthose  days  all  Presbyterian  ministers  received  theso  called  Regium  Donum  a  small  sum  "given"as  a  solace  to  the  "dissenting  meeting-houses."On  the  basis  of  this  gracious  favor  vast  effortswere  made  to  hold  the  Presbyterian  Assemblytrue  to  the  principle  of  a  "God-fearing  state."It  would  never  do,  therefore,  to  have  a  Liberalelected  to  the  moderatorship.  The  editor  of  theEvangelical  Witness,  and  the  man  who  had  atlast  given  Dublin  a  worthy  Presbyterian  church,and  made  Presbyterianism  known  and  respectedas  something  more  than  the  Ulster  tail  to  theOrange  kite,  was  the  natural  candidate.  It  wasquite  impossible  to  impeach  the  orthodoxy  orspiritual  experience  of  my  father,  but  he  hadsomehow  to  be  gotten  rid  of  in  an  honorableand  yet  effective  way.  This  way  was  easilyfound.  He  was  made  a  delegate  to  the  Assemblies'  meeting  in  the  United  States  of  America.MARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN         141Dr.  J.  C.  Johnston  (Dublin)  reports  l  a  reply  saidto  have  been  made  at  this  time  by  my  father.Some  one  said  to  him  "I  thought  you  were  tohave  been  moderator?"  "My  brethren  havetransported  me,"  was  the  half-humorous  rejoinder.  So  transported  he  was,  adds  Dr.  Johnston,  "  and  his  political  and  other  heresies  troubledthe  Assembly  no  more."It  was  under  these  circumstances  that  the  firstjourney  was  undertaken  to  America  in  companywith  Dr.  Denham  Smith  as  delegates  to  the  General  Assembly  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  North.No  thought  at  that  time  had  entered  my  father'smind  that  he  might  be  called  to  leave  Dublin.Many  interests  bound  him  to  the  place.  He  feltdeeply  responsible  for  the  success  of  the  newchurch  in  Rutland  Square.  The  future  of  theEvangelical  Witness  seemed  to  depend  largelyupon  him.  He  was  surrounded  by  able  andsympathetic  men,  for  not  only  was  his  old  friendand  college  companion,  Dr.  Hamilton  Magee  inDublin,  but  Dr.  Fleming  Stevenson  was  meetingwith  great  and  deserved  success  in  a  new  churchenterprise  with  which  my  father  had  had  muchto  do.  In  fact  on  all  sides  he  was  engaged,  as1  The  Irish  Presbyterian,  November,  1898.i42  THE  MINISTRY  INhe  thought,  usefully.  He  had  refused  a  splendidopening  for  usefulness  in  Glasgow.  A  committeehad  waited  upon  him  from  free  St.  George'sChurch  in  Edinburgh  to  urge  him  to  considerthat  opening,  but  he  not  only  refused,  but  at  hissuggestion  the  matter  was  kept  confidential,  anduntil  the  memoirs  of  one  of  the  committeemenwas  published  in  which  the  offer  was  mentionedno  public  knowledge  was  had  of  the  refusal.Even  in  Belfast  many  were  hoping  that  he  wouldsooner  or  later  be  called  to  take  the  real  leadership  in  the  Assembly.The  attempt  to  nominate  him  for  the  modera-torship  revealed  what  was  a  complete  surprise  tohim.  He  saw  that  the  "pillars"  did  not  wanthim.  He  was  too  active,  too  aggressive,  too  little  of  a  man  to  handle,  too  hard  to  confer  secretlywith,  nor  was  he  given  to  schemes  and  arrangements.  He  was  moreover  a  Liberal,  believed  insecular  education  and  personal  rights.  Hethought  questions  should  be  debated  in  opencourt,  and  that  men  should  respect  each  other'sdiffering  views.  To  his  dying  day  he  loved  andreverenced  Dr.  Cooke,  and  looked  on  him  withalmost  an  indiscriminating  honor  and  affection.He  saw  no  reason  why  the  small  men  who  cametoddling  after  Dr.  Cooke  imitating  their  leader  onMARY'S  ABBEY— DUBLIN          143his  weakest  side,  should  quarrel  with  him  because  he  could  not  share  Dr.  Cooke's  politicalopinions,  or  be  blinded  by  the  Conservativechaff  obsequious  Tories  flung  in  Dr.  Cooke's  eyes.He  knew,  moreover,  that  Dr.  Cooke  himself  demanded  no  sacrifice  of  manhood  from  his  youngerbrethren  ;  that  although  accustomed  to  be  obeyed,and  proud  of  his  judgment  and  skill  in  debate,yet  even  so  in  the  most  acrid  disputes  of  theold  Arian  controversy,  Dr.  Cooke  had  maintained  the  position  that  there  should  be  no  persecution  "for  personal  opinion"  and  no  legislationthat  would  be  retroactive  ;  and  that  only  convinced  judgment  was  worth  anything  to  theChurch.It  was  with  mingled  feelings,  therefore,  as  thecorrespondence  shows,  that  the  invitation  to  goas  delegate  to  America  was  accepted,  and  otherovertures  coming  just  at  that  time  of  a  most  inviting  character,  opened  up  before  him,  as  hestarted  westward,  the  whole  subject  of  his  dutyto  Ireland,  to  himself  and  to  the  Church  at  large.At  the  same  time  the  idea  of  going  to  Americawas  wholly  strange  to  him.  There  were  not  asmany  ties  between  the  two  countries  then  asnow,  and  so  far  as  the  writer  knows,  the  call  extended  to  the  Dublin  preacher  by  the  New  Yorki44      THE  MINISTRY  IN  DUBLINcongregation  was  one  of  the  first  calls  of  thekind,  although  the  precedent  was  followed  veryoften  in  after  years.  To  the  little  household  inDublin  the  trip  seemed  an  exceedingly  formidableone.  The  far-off  land  lay  then  on  a  vastly  moremisty  horizon  than  it  does  now,  although  evenyet  the  American  much  more  easily  makes  thejourney  to  Europe,  accustomed  as  the  Americanis  to  longer  distances  in  his  own  land,  than  doesthe  European  make  the  trip  to  America.  Hencewith  some  measure  of  excitement,  natural  underthe  circumstances,  the  duties  of  the  delegationwere  undertaken.VI.

WASHINGTON<AND  BALTIMORE.  THE  JOURNEY  HOME.IN  the  spring  of  1867  my  parents  went  with  anold  friend,  with  whom  they  often  travelled,for  a  trip  to  Italy.  They  left  Dublin  on  March25th,  for  London,  going  at  once  to  Paris,  andthence  next  day  to  Lyons,  Marseilles,  Nice  andthence  by  steamer  to  Genoa,  and  after  a  ratherhurried  visit  to  Naples  and  the  surroundingcountry  they  proceeded  to  Rome  to  be  there  intime  for  the  Lenten  week,  and  the  Easter  celebration.  The  impressions  made  on  my  father  bythis  visit  to  Rome  he  often  recalled.  He  hadmany  warm  personal  admirers  among  the  RomanCatholics,  and  had  worked  with  them  in  Irelandin  many  public  enterprises,  but  he  had  a  deeply-rooted  sense  of  the  danger  of  Roman  Catholicismas  a  system.  In  Rome  he  saw  what  he  considered  the  pure  heathenism  of  both  the  ceremonial  and  the  government.  In  those  days  Romewas  still  under  the  dominion  of  the  Vatican.'47148  FIRST  JOURNEYThe  luggage  was  searched  for  forbidden  books,among  which  the  New  Testament  was  countedas  one,  and  on  every  hand  was  seen  the  administrative  inefficiency  of  the  Papal  power  in  Rome.When  in  1870  a  change  became  inevitable  in  themastery  over  Rome  no  one  rejoiced  more  at  thethought  of  a  free  Italy  than  did  my  father.  Theglory  of  the  music,  and  the  gorgeous  nature  ofthe  spectacle  in  Rome  was  not  enough  to  hidefrom  him  the  miserable  bondage,  as  he  saw  it,  ofthe  superstitions  that  overlaid  the  gospel.  Thecrowds  of  dirty  monks,  the  beggars,  the  filth  of  theside  streets,  the  disorder  during  the  processions,the  eternal  paying  of  small  sums  for  services  notreally  rendered,  and  the  miserable  way  in  whichthe  art  treasures  and  the  priceless  antiquities  werekept  seem  to  have  been  the  impressions  mostdeeply  made  upon  the  whole  party.  So  bad  wasthe  drainage,  and  so  defective  the  water  supply,that  each  returning  Easter  season  with  its  crowdsbrought  fever  as  a  regular  and  expected  guestinto  the  city.  Nor  did  the  party  wholly  escape,although  prompt  flight  to  Florence  stopped  theattack  from  reaching  a  serious  point..  The  appointment  to  go  to  America  compelled  my  fatherto  hurry  home,  and  leaving  the  two  ladies  inParis  he  made  his  way  back  to  Dublin.  A  pas-DR.  JOHN  HALL  AT  THE  AGE  OF  THIRTY-EIGHTTO  THE  UNITED  STATES        149sage  having  been  secured  for  him  on  the  steamship  City  of  New  York,  he  was  bound  to  sailon  the  2d  of  May.  This  first  voyage  was  so  newan  experience  that  a  careful  journal  was  kept.The  contrast  between  the  present  day  comfortmakes  some  selections  from  it  of  interest."  2d  May,  1867.  Left  my  most  happy  home  ateight  o'clock  for  Queen's  Bridge  Station.  Had  thecarriage  mostly  to  myself  for  reading  purposesgood,  no  one  coming  in  to  whom  I  cared  to  talk.Got  a  horse  and  cart  (Cork  cars  too  small)  to  takemy  luggage  to  the  Queenstown  Station.  After  adelay  of  an  hour  the  steamer  was  signalled,  andwe  saw  her  coming  in.  The  passengers  gathered,  and  we  all  set  out  in  the  tender  for  her —about  half  a  mile  away.  The  embarking  of  thesteerage  passengers  was  a  scramble,  in  the  endof  which  I  got  my  luggage  and  possession  of  mycabin.  I  find  I  have  a  room  all  to  myself.  It  isa  very  good  one  in  the  centre  of  the  ship,  although  the  steward  says  it  takes  in  water  in  certain  weather.  I  got  settled  about  six  o'clock,  andgoing  on  deck  found  the  night  too  thick  to  see  muchof  the  land.  I  waited  for  tea  at  half-past  seven,  butwhen  it  was  served  was  not  disposed  for  it;  wentto  my  berth  and  had  an  undisturbed  night's  sleep."  3d  May,  Friday.    Could  have  had  some  break-I5o  FIRST  JOURNEYfast  but  the  steward  forgot  my  order,  and  I  didnot  feel  enough  appetite  to  make  a  row,  forwhen  I  got  up  I  felt  squeamish,  but  was  verywell  in  bed.  At  four  I  rose  and  dressed  andwent  on  deck  after  dinner.  It  was  raining,  andafter  surveying  the  scene  without  poetry  or  enthusiasm  of  any  kind  I  returned,  undressed  andwent  to  bed.  The  strongest  feeling  of  my  rathertorpid  nature  at  this  time  was  one  of  profoundthankfulness  that  my  darling  children  werehappy  at  home,  and  my  beloved  wife  enjoyingherself  in  Paris.  I  was  not  however  continuouslysick,  but  was  plainly  thought  to  be  so,  for  an  opposite  neighbor  with  whom  I  had  exchanged  scrapsof  personal  history  on  Thursday  evening  (fromHollywood,  County  Down)  came  to  me  and  offeredsome  '  excellent  oaten  bread'  which  his  wife  hadbought  as  a  'good  thing  to  settle  the  stomach.'  Ifelt  the  kindness,  but  as  she  herself  was  audibly  illin  bed  I  did  not  feel  proper  confidence  in  the  cure."  Saturday  morning,  May  4th.  .  .  .  I  oughtto  say  that  the  ship's  motion  is  easy,  but  to  me  disagreeable,  though  I  can  hardly  tell  why.  We  haveour  sails  set  and  are  going  over  smooth  enoughwater  at  twelve  miles  an  hour,  so  that  we  must  benow  about  540  miles  from  Cork  on  Saturday  afternoon.TO  THE  UNITED  STATES        151"Wednesday  morning,  May  8th.  Soon  afterthe  above  was  written  the  weather  became  toorough  to  admit  of  doing  anything  with  comfortexcept  '  looking  upward  '  and  thinking  of  my  treasures  on  earth.  The  high  sea  makes  the  sound  ofthe  engine  and  screw  most  disagreeable.  Remorseless  unresting,  it  keeps  pounding  away  as  itwere  at  my  very  head,  and  accompanied  as  it  is  bythe  dashing  of  the  water  along  the  side  of  the  shipand  especially  about  the  screw,  it  is  not  at  allfavorable  to  rest  at  night,  especially  in  the  crib,which  it  is  an  insult  to  my  usual  sleeping  place  tocall  '  a  bed.'  Sabbath  continued  rough  with  mostdisagreeable  cross  seas:  no  service  of  any  kindcould  be  had,  and  many  were  sick  in  their  berths.Of  the  remainder  many,  1  am  sorry  to  say,  weredrunk  at  night.  Each  afternoon  I  went  for  a  littleon  deck,  but  have  not  much  appetite  save  formeat,  and  I  feel  as  if  I  could  consume  a  jar  ofpickles."  On  Monday  the  cross  seas  changed  into  a  seriesof  squalls,  dead  against  us  which  reduced  ourspeed  to  about  six  knots  an  hour,  and  made  ourplunging  through  it  very  uncomfortable.  I  spentthe  whole  forepart  of  the  day  on  deck,  the  forepart  of  the  ship  every  now  and  then  covered  witha  sheet  of  spray.  .  .  .  Had  a  good  deal  of152  FIRST  JOURNEYtalk  with  some  passengers,  and  especially  witha  highly  educated  German  (I  suspect  a  Jesuitpriest)  who  speaks  English  well,  and  knows  theolder  philosophy  well,  but  he  is  feeble  indeed  asto  the  truth.  He  could  not  hold  his  ground  fiveminutes  with  Hamilton  Magee."On  Tuesday  things  got  still  worse.  A  stiffnorthwesterly  wind  blowing  us  out  of  ourcourse.  Only  a  sailor  could  hold  his  footing.  Isat  a  long  time  on  the  steps  and  watched  thescene,  the  captain,  who,  of  course,  made  little  ofit  with  me  for  a  little  while.  Storms  are  paintedfairly  enough  by  the  writers  and  painters.  Thegreat  irregular  moving  masses  of  water,  black,dark  blue,  cobalt  and  now  and  then,  as  the  sunshone  through  the  tops  of  the  waves,  light-blueand  even  green  like  malachite,  may  well  enoughlook  to  the  imaginations  of  steerage  passengerson  a  lower  deck  '  mountain  high.'  In  pointof  fact  I  think  the  valleys  were  about  fifteen  feetdeep.  The  stormy  petrels  were  skimming  theirsides,  like  swallows,  no  doubt  seeking  their  food.The  screams  of  great  sea-birds  were  now  andagain  heard,  and  their  plunges  into  the  waveswere  seen.  They  are  often  in  the  '  troubled  'waters  behind  the  ship.  As  night  came  on  thesea  grew  worse,  and  with  nothing  but  the  shipTO  THE  UNITED  STATES        153to  blow  against  the  motion  became  unpleasant.The  wind  went  hissing  through  the  shrouds(like  the  confidential  whisper  of  the  tempest)with  a  subdued  force  that  we  felt  rather  thanheard,  and  it  was  withal  very  cold.  I  went  tobed  realizing  I  trust  and  feel  the  meaning  ofPsalm  46  (God  is  our  refuge  and  our  strength).The  early  part  of  the  night  continued  rough,  buttowards  morning  it  moderated,  and  the  windchopped  about  on  our  beam,  so  that  we  havesome  sails  up  and  are  going  as  fast  as  on  the  firstdays.  .  .  .  Among  the  suffering  ladies  I  amsorry  to  report  my  oaten-cake  friend,  who  hasnot  realized  the  benefit  of  the  specific.  She  hasnot  left  her  cabin,  but  may  be  heard  in  it,  whereshe  is  accompanied  by  two  suffering  children.As  I  write  the  ship  rolls  a  good  deal  and  makeswriting  very  difficult.  I  have  my  pockets  full  ofbooks,  and  beside  me  the  features  of  my  ownlittle  circle,  and  now  that  we  are  more  than  halfway  to  New  York,  and  we  may  hope  the  worserhalf,  I  need  not  feel  cast  down.  In  time  perhapsI  would  get  inured  to  life  at  sea  but  it  would  takelong.*****"  Wednesday,  four  o'clock.     This  is  the  firstendurable  day  for  three  or  four.     The  day  keeps154  FIRST  JOURNEYfine,  and  we  make  fair  progress.  I  have  donemore  to-day  in  reading,  etc.,  than  any  one  elselikely  on  board.  It  is  a  lazy  life.  Got  throughseveral  magazines  which  had  lain  by  me  on  thecontinent.  The  ship  will  soon  have  been  eightclear  days  from  Liverpool,  and  if  it  had  not  beenfor  adverse  winds  three  more  would  likely  havebrought  us  in  sight  of  America.  Now  it  will\ikely  take  five  more.  .  .  .  Last  night  I  foundsome  Irish  Presbyterians  on  board,  and  to-day  Iwas  a  good  deal  among  the  steerage  people  talking  to  them  as  well  as  1  could.  They  are  of  allnations,  and  this  is  not  easy.  To-day  the  shipmade  320  miles,  and  if  all  goes  well  we  shall  stillreach  New  York  on  Monday.  I  have  made  theacquaintance  of  an  Englishman,  an  engineer  whohas  been  through  Turkey  in  Asia.  His  littleGreek  wife  is  with  him,  the  daughter  of  a  Greekcaptain  of  a  Turkish  warship.  She  cannot  speakEnglish  and  he  cannot  speak  Greek,  but  bothspeak  Turkish  and  so  converse  in  that  tongue.He  gives  a  bad  account  of  the  Greeks  as  dishonest,  mean  and  lying.  He  is  not  a  man  of  culture,but  in  knocking  about  the  world  has  learnedmany  facts.  .  .  .  Our  captain  is  the  manwho  was  out  fifty-four  days  in  the  City  ofWashington,  whose  screw  was  lost.  He  putTO  THE  UNITED  STATES        155his  passengers  aboard  another  ship  and  stuck  byhis  own.  .  .  .  There  are  760  steerage  passengers!  Swiss,  Swedes,  Dutch,  English,  Americans  and  Irish;  and  the  crew  also  are  much  divided  in  nationality.  .  .  .  I  spoke  to  a  youngwoman  (married)  going  to  San  Francisco,  whotold  me  her  family  lived  in  Dublin,  and  that  herbrother  was  or  had  been  a  Methodist,  but  now  wentto  a  'people  they  call  Presbyterians,  and  the  minister  was  a  Dr.  Hall  or  Hawley,  she  didn't  knowwhich.'  I  took  his  address.  Have  been  amongthe  steerage  folks  again — not  many  English-speaking  Protestants  among  them.  But  on  the  wholea  sober  lot.  The  worst  case,  I  am  sorry  to  say,of  beastly  drinking  is  among  the  cabin  passengers — a  Belfast  man,  who  gives  himself  out  tobe  a  mill  owner.*****"Sabbath  morning,  May  i2th.  Good  sleep,  andup  early  as  the  captain  has  asked  me  to  preach.Good  congregation  including  two  Jews  and  aRoman  Catholic  doctor,  and  a  Roman  Catholicpriest,  already  mentioned  from  Germany.  Mytext  was  i  Peter  1:19.  Afterwards  went  belowamong  the  steerage  passengers  and  never  spenta  happier  time  than  the  four  hours  with  them;the  Swedes,  five  hundred  of  them,  all  Lutheran,156  FIRST  JOURNEYsinging  their  hymns  to  the  tune  'I  have  a  Fatherin  the  promised  land.'  I  got  hold  of  a  good  ladwho  spoke  English  and  interpreted  and  I  preachedto  them.  Their  tears  flowed.  They  kissed  myhands,  and  were  most  grateful.  All  are  learningEnglish.  The  evening  was  fine,  the  moon  shining,  and  we  getting  on  our  way  very  well."The  rest  of  the  journal  is  filled  with  little  detailsof  only  relative  interest  now.  My  father  wastaken  at  once  to  the  home  of  Mr.  James  Stuart,a  distant  relative,  where  as  he  remarks,  "I  amluxuriously  lodged."The  object  of  sending  a  delegation  to  Americafrom  the  church  of  Ireland  was  to  establish  againbonds  of  fellowship  imperilled  by  the  Civil  war,and  its  divisions  of  sentiment.  Dr.  Denham  wasaccompanied  by  his  wife,  but  my  father  as  theyounger  man,  expected  to  travel  too  far  and  toofast  to  permit  of  the  trip  being  a  pleasure  to  alady.  He  at  one  time  thought  of  taking  hiseldest  boy,  but  the  same  considerations  preventedthat  plan  also.  He  had  only  eight  weeks  in  thecountry,  and  in  that  time  he  spoke  day  after  dayin  nearly  all  the  eastern  and  many  of  the  westerncities.  The  delegation  was  formally  accreditedto  the  Old  and  New  School  Assemblies,  to  theSynod  of  the  Reformed  church  and  to  the  SynodTO  THE  UNITED  STATES        157of  the  Covenanters,  and  while  in  America  a  commission  came  to  them  to  the  Covenanter  Synodin  Canada.  One  of  the  vivid  recorded  impressions  of  New  York  was  a  thunder-storm  whichcame  soon  after  landing;  "  I  slept  well,  notwithstanding  a  thunder-storm  last  night  like  which  Inever  saw  anything."  The  first  duty  was  discharged  in  meeting  the  "  Covenanters,"  as  myfather  calls  the  body  to  which  Mr.  George  H.Stuart  at  that  time  belonged,  i.  e.,  the  UnitedPresbyterian  Church,  and  which  was  meeting  inNew  York.  Mr.  Stuart  was  a  relative,  and  had  anational  reputation  in  religious  circles  on  accountof  his  zeal  and  energy  in  all  good  works,  but  inparticular  in  connection  with  that  of  the  Christian  commission  throughout  the  Civil  war.  Noreligious  public  meeting  without  Mr.  Stuart  aschairman  was  considered  quite  complete.  Hewas  afterwards  disciplined  by  his  body  for  singing  hymns,  which  as  he  was  totally  tone-deafseemed  to  many  to  be  making  a  crime  out  of  acalamity.  He  had  long  known  and  corresponded  with  my  father,  (see  page  58)  and  hadshown  practical  and  wise  interest  in  the  Con-naught  mission.  It  was  now  a  great  and  realpleasure  to  him  to  arrange  plans  for  the  appearances  of  the  delegation.  Mr.  Stuart  had  an  in-158  FIRST  JOURNEYsatiable  appetite  for  public  meetings,  and  hismere  presence  insured  that  the  meeting  would  bewell  arranged,  full  of  snap  and  thoroughly  well-known  beforehand.  He  moreover  knew  wellthe  American  public,  and  was  in  touch  with  asmany  religious  interests  as  any  man  of  his  generation.  He  at  once  began  making  plans  for  theexploiting  of  the  Irish  delegation.  Mr.  Stuartcoming  himself  from  Markethill  in  the  north  ofIreland  felt  a  most  particular  desire  to  have  theresults  of  the  mission  as  abundant  as  possible.In  a  letter  to  the  home  circle,  my  father  says  inone  place:  "I  need  not  now  dwell  upon  impressions.  Everything  indicates  wealth,  and  all  thatmoney  can  buy  is  on  hand.  Every  one  is  mostkind,  and  I  am  sure,  sincerely  glad  to  see  us.  Weshall  have  hard  work  for  the  next  month,  if  weovertake  all  the  engagements  made  for  us.  NewYork  is  fine;  in  the  end  I  live  is  like  the  westend  of  Glasgow;  the  business  end  has  an  unfinished  rough  and  ready,  republican  kind  oflook,  every  house  having  a  mind  of  its  own."After  meeting  with  the  Reformed  Presbyterian  church  the  start  was  made  for  Rochesterwhere  the  New  School  Assembly  was  in  session.The  trip  took  the  party  up  the  Hudson,  whichmade  a  most  enduring  impression  upon  the  visi-TO  THE  UNITED  STATES        159tors.  "The  river  itself  is  far  finer  than  theRhine,  or  any  river  in  Europe,  although,  ofcourse,  it  lacks  the  historic  feature,  and  thepicturesque  castles  of  the  old  world  scenery,"was  the  verdict  of  my  father.  As  it  happenedtwo  brothers  of  younger  years  had  preceded  myfather  to  America,  and  as  both  were  in  Canada,and  not  far  from  the  Falls  of  Niagara,  he  writes"I  found  at  breakfast  that  I  was  within  a  day'sjourney  and  six  dollars  of  Robert.  The  love  ofmy  brothers  got  the  better  of  the  love  of  the  Fallsand  at  ten  o'clock  I  was  off  to  the  Canada  side,crossed  Lake  Ontario  by  boat  to  Toronto,  thencesixty-three  miles  by  train.  There  I  spent  theSabbath  and  preached  in  the  Presbyterian  andWesleyan  churches."On  Tuesday  the  delegation  was  received  atRochester  by  the  New  School  Assembly,  and"very  cordially"  is  the  comment  of  the  correspondence.  Thence  they  proceeded  to  Cincinnati,  "rather  slowly"  my  father  thought,  but"Dr.  Denham  does  not  like  to  go  too  fast."  AtCincinnati  the  speech  of  my  father  made  a  profound  impression.  The  enthusiasm  aroused  wasvery  great,  and  from  that  time  on  calls  cameto  him  to  speak  at  meetings  all  over  the  countryat  most  impossible  distances.  Of  this  speech160  FIRST  JOURNEYHarper's  Weekly  said:  "His  eloquent  speech  onthe  occasion  of  his  reception,  which  was  one  ofthe  striking  incidents  of  that  Assembly,  will  neverbe  forgotten  by  any  who  heard  it."  The  response  to  the  many  calls  for  speeches  began  totry  even  the  younger  member  of  the  delegation.He  writes,  "I  am  in  good  health,  I  am  thankfulto  say,  but  it  is  very  fast  work,  and  the  mealsare  so  unlike  my  own  in  time,  quality,  etc.,  that  Iam  not  always  comfortable."  At  the  same  timehe  says:  "Our  coming  to  the  new  school  hasalready  done  good,  and  a  deputation  will  be  inEdinburgh  and  in  Dublin.  Please  to  send  a  letteron  getting  this  to  Dr.  McCosh  telling  him  thatthe  new  school  deputation  will  be  in  Edinburgh,and  that  they  are  looking  to  him  to  care  for  themin  Ireland."In  the  correspondence  of  this  period  greatcomfort  is  taken  in  a  small  coin.  "Tell  Emily  Ihave  her  half-penny  as  a  memorial  of  her,  andoften  look  at  it."  The  last  day  in  Dublin,  had  infact  been  given  to  the  children.  It  is  one  of  thewriter's  vivid  memories  of  going  in  Phrenix  Parkfor  a  last  "  long  walk  "  with  the  father  who  wasgoing  to  America.  The  children  had  heard  of  theexpense  of  such  a  journey,  and  just  before  parting  the  little  daughter,  about  six  years  of  age,TO  THE  UNITED  STATES        161slipped  a  half-penny  into  the  father's  hand.  "  Itis  all  I  have,  but  it  may  help  towards  the  expensein  America."  It  certainly  did  help  to  cheer  thejourney,  as  many  allusions  to  it  in  the  home  letters  abundantly  prove.In  the  hurry  and  rush  of  those  eight  busyweeks  the  family  in  Eccles  Street  was  never  forgotten.  The  leaves  of  the  journal  have  a  "  banknote  "  for  Bolton's  collection  of  stamps  and  bills;a  "coin  or  two  "  is  in  the  trunk  for  Robert's  collection.  Alas,  the  shops  of  New  York  are  "entirely  too  expensive  to  permit  of  the  purchase  ofmany  little  things  one  would  like  to  take  homeas  keep-sakes,"  but  "no  doubt  I  will  find  something  for  the  rest  by  and  by."  From  Cincinnatithe  plans  carried  the  party  to  Xenia,  Ohio,  andthence  to  Indianapolis,  and  every  occasion  for  aspeech  or  a  public  meeting  was  made  the  mostof  by  Mr.  Stuart  who  was  now  in  full  control.At  Springfield  the  life  and  death  of  Lincoln  isnoted  with  tender  words.  In  the  struggle  between  the  North  and  the  South,  my  father  hadtaken  a  definite  stand  in  a  speech  made  in  Glasgow  as  the  war  was  going  on,  on  the  side  of  theNorth.  Even  as  a  student  he  had  interested  himself,  as  we  have  seen,  in  the  liberation  movement.For  Lincoln  he  always  had  a  sincere  admiration162  FIRST  JOURNEYmingled  with  regrets  that  he  lacked,  what  myfather  thought  he  most  needed,  the  comforts  ofan  active  militant  Christian  life.The  State  of  Illinois  impressed  the  traveller  immensely.  He  writes,  "The  next  day  we  cameby  Dayton,  to  the  capital  of  Missouri  (St.  Louis)about  260  miles,  and  right  across  the  whole  Stateof  Illinois,  one  of  the  finest  and  richest  countriesI  have  ever  seen.  The  land  is  so  level  that  onesees  ten  miles,  and  so  fertile  that  it  needs  nomanure  for  twenty  years  and  produces  100bushels  of  corn  to  the  acre  ! "  In  St.  Louis,Springfield,  Lafayette  meetings  were  held  atwhich  my  father  preached,  and  then  the  partywent  on  to  Chicago.  He  writes,  "  I  am  notoverworked,  though  I  do  not  like  the  livinghere,  and  am  better  at  home  with  you.  But  theprofusion  of  things,  fruits  of  the  earth  especiallythat  are  eaten  is  something  wonderful.  Thestate  of  religion  is  much  like  as  with  us.  InEurope  people  do  not  enough  carry  religion  intotheir  business.  Here  I  think  they  carry  businessinto  their  religion  a  good  deal."Of  Chicago  the  impression  was  of  rush  andhurry.  "It  is  the  Queen  of  the  West,  with200,000  people,  where  thirty  years  ago  there  wereonly  600!  We  get  crowded  meetings,  and  areTO  THE  UNITED  STATES        163wonderfully  reported,  as  you  will  see,  not  inwhat  we  say,  but  how  we  say  it."  And  again,"We  are  carried  round  Sabbath-schools  to  noend,  and  Dr.  Denham  and  I  get  rid  of  a  good  dealof  perspiration.  Happily  we  have  plenty  of  icedwater."  Crowded  meetings  in  Pittsburg  arementioned,  and  thence  the  journey  was  to  Philadelphia.  Here  again  preaching,  speaking,  andvisiting  schools,  institutions,  and  attending  publicdinners  consumed  the  time,  until  at  last  my  fatherinsisted  on  a  day  or  two  of  leisure  to  visit  Baltimore  and  Washington,  both  of  which  cities  seemat  that  time  to  have  rather  disappointed  him,although  he  was  deeply  and  profoundly  movedby  the  graves  at  Arlington,  "where  rest  30,000soldiers,  sleeping  their  last  bivouac."Lecture  engagements  called  him  thence  to  Canada,  and  from  there  down  through  the  New  England  States,  speaking  on  the  way  at  Amherst,and  recalling  Jonathan  Edwards  as  he  passedNorthampton.  On  the  23d  he  was  in  New  Yorkagain  and  found  that  arrangements  had  beenmade  for  him  to  preach  in  the  morning  for  Dr.Adams  (New  School)  and  in  the  afternoon  inthe  Fifth  Avenue  Church  (Old  School),  and  atDr.  Duvyea's  in  the  evening.  On  the  24th  hewas  in  Princeton,  speaking  there  and  addressing1 64  FIRST  JOURNEYthe  Cliosophic  Society,  which  had  elected  him  amember.  Here  he  met  Dr.  Hodge  and  others.From  this  on  the  time  was  filled  with  various  appointments  and  visits  to  various  people,  includingthe  run  up  to  Canada,  already  mentioned,  andthen  on  the  I3th  of  July  passage  was  taken  onthe  City  of  London,  for  the  old  home.This  trip  to  America  made  a  great  impressionupon  him  of  the  vast  possibilities  for  good  orevil  that  lay  involved  in  the  tremendous  powerand  wealth  he  saw  was  in  the  future.  Mr.  Stuarthad  set  his  heart  on  having  him  come  to  America,even  before  this  visit,  but  the  idea  only  veryvaguely  crossed  his  mind  that  he  himself  shouldever  come,  but  in  one  place  he  says,  "  I  canhardly  overcome  the  idea  that  at  some  futuretime  some  of  the  children  will  be  on  this  continent,  where  things  are  done  on  so  much  larger  ascale  than  with  us."Looking  back  upon  his  first  visit  to  America,my  father  once  recorded  some  of  his  earlymemories  and  impressions  which  in  part  are  asfollows  :"  I  landed  from  the  City  of  New  York  steameron  Manhattan  Island,  not  as  an  emigrant  nor  amere  tourist,  but  to  discharge  an  honorable  andpleasant  duty  as  a  delegate  from  the  '  motherTO  THE  UNITED  STATES        165Church,'  in  Ireland  (for  so  we  may  truly  callher),  to  the  Presbyterian  Churches  in  Synod  andAssemblies  in  the  United  States.  Expecting  tobe  only  a  couple  of  months  in  the  country,  andthen  to  return  to  pastoral  duty  in  the  capital  ofmy  native  land,  I  meant,  of  course,  to  keep  eyesand  ears  very  wide  open,  and  to  carry  away  asmuch  as  possible  of — not  money,  for  my  expenses  were  provided  for  by  the  body  represented,  nor  glory,  for  I  thought  myself  quite  unfit  for  the  task — but  knowledge  of  the  places,  thepeople,  and  the  institutions  of  which  I  had  readand  heard  from  childhood."A  lovely  summer  day,  the  I3th  May,  1867 —was  the  day  of  landing;  and,  like  most  others,  Ilooked  with  unbounded  admiration  upon  thescenery  opening  up  to  the  eye  as  one  enters  theNarrows  and  approaches  the  city.  There  isnothing  just  like  it  in  Europe  as  a  bit  of  scenery,and  there  is  nothing  at  all  like  its  magnificent,dignified  ferry-boats,  with  their  great  beams  inthe  air,  not  to  speak  of  those  models  of  confidence  and  impudence,  the  steam-tugs.  I  had  hadthe  advantage  of  a  few  days'  seasickness  in  thesolitude  of  a  room,  knew  no  one  on  board,  andexpected  to  see  dear  friends  on  the  Americanshore;  so  when  the  tugs  rushed  past,  and166  FIRST  JOURNEYscreamed,  '  Keep  out  of  my  way  if  you  want  tobe  safe,'  it  was  natural  to  laugh  in  admiration.There  was  a  little  disenchantment  over  therather  ragged  piers  in  great  contrast  with  thesolid  cut-stone  docks  of  such  places  as  Liverpool,and  in  the  rather  rough  streets  over  which  onewas  rolled,  but  it  was  not  forgotten  that  thecountry  was  new,  and  some  things  needed  to  be'  fixed  up.'  There  was  an  opportunity  given  tospeak  the  very  night  of  the  first  day  on  theAmerican  soil,  and  I  am  bound  to  say  gratefullythat  the  country  has  continued  in  this  respect  asit  began  with  me."Oh!  what  a  day  that  was  that  laid  bare,  inpleasant  sunshine,  the  glories  of  the  Hudson,right  and  left,  as  surveyed  from  the  steamboat.There  were  books  and  papers  for  the  way,  butthey  had  a  holiday.  I  had  been  on  the  Rhine  andamong  other  tempting  bits  of  European  sceneryin  the  previous  spring.  There  were,  of  course,the  castles,  the  chalets  and  the  lingering  traditions;  but  for  grace,  dignity  and  interest  theHudson  is  far  ahead  of  them,  and  well  preparedone  for  the  Falls  of  Niagara  the  next  day.'  Blood  is  thicker  than  water,'  and  the  Fallswere  soon  forsaken  for  a  brother  and  a  group  ofunknown  cousins  on  the  Canadian  side.  It  wasTO  THE  UNITED  STATES        167good  to  see  an  old  aunt,  settled  in  Canada  aboutthe  time  I  was  born,  and  to  hear  her  tell  ofchildren  and  children's  children,  and  chuckleover  the  saying  of  the  neighbors  that  'if  youthrew  up  a  stone  anywhere,  it  would  fall  onone  of  them.'  Duties  really  began  at  Rochester,  where  an  Assembly  met.  I  came  inafter  midnight,  and  judge  of  my  horror  onfinding  the  portmanteau  that  contained  thespeeches  lost!  And,  to  add  to  the  terrors,  thespeech  had  to  come  off  early  next  forenoon.  Nomatter.  There  was  an  opportunity  to  see  thenoble  form  of  Dr.  Adams,  and  without  beingtold,  guess  his  commanding  position.  And  thespeeches  got  themselves  off  at  Cincinnati,  andXenia,  and  Indianapolis,  and  Chicago,  and  eachday  brought  its  store  of  new  ideas,  and  it  didseem  too  bad  to  have  only  a  few  days  in  Philadelphia,  and  then  a  few  more  in  New  York,  andthen  quit  the  continent  probably  forever!"The  voyage  home  was  uneventful.  At  firstcalm,  and  yet  very  slow.  The  notes  of  the  voyage  declare,  "  This  ship  is  about  390  feet  long,100  feet  longer  than  the  City  of  New  York,  moresteady,  but  her  machinery  is  defective,  and  shehas  had  to  stop  three  times  to  allow  it  to  coal.The  table  is  good.  The  first  few  days  we  had168  FIRST  JOURNEYfine  weather,  but  our  motion  was  slow,  one  daywe  only  did  156  miles.  I  have  been  able  topreach  each  Sabbath  morning,  and  to  very  attentive  audiences,  some  of  whom  wept.  Onerough  sailor  declared  to  me  in  a  sort  of  '  aside  'on  deck,  that  '  he  could  listen  to  me  talking  tothe  day  of  Pentecost,'  a  well  meant  though  ill-expressed  compliment.  I  have  read  a  good  dealon  board,  including  periodicals,  the  EdinburghReview,  North  British  Review  and  Charles  King-sley's  'Two  Years  Ago'  and  'Yeast."1  Thelanding  was  at  last  affected,  and  Dublin  wasreached,  where  the  little  family  was  found  inrestored  health.  For  while  away  the  twoyounger  children  had  been  ill.  At  once  wasbegun  the  ceaseless  round  of  visits  that  markedthe  faithful  ministry  during  its  whole  range.VII.

REMONSTRANCES.REASONS  FOR  GOING.  CORRESPONDENCE  WITH  ^AMERICA.<AN  IRISH  ESTIMATE  OF  SERVICE  RENDERED.EVEN  before  the  delegation  had  left  America,the  Fifth  Avenue  Presbyterian  Church  Session  had  considered  the  wisdom  of  calling  myfather  to  the  vacant  pulpit,  and  had  cautious  approaches  made  to  him.  These  overtures  werenot  however  taken  seriously  by  him,  and  in  hisignorance  of  local  conditions  he  could  give  themno  thought.  He  was  therefore  not  a  little  surprised  to  learn  from  Mr.  George  H.  Stuart  thatthe  matter  was  being  definitely  pushed,  and  thathe  would  be  compelled  to  consider  some  overture.  The  letter  stating  this  was  followed  almostimmediately  by  a  cable  from  Mr.  William  Walker,as  clerk  of  the  session,  saying,  "  Large,  meetingof  congregation  voted  you  cordial  and  unanimous  call."In  those  days  cables  were  not  as  common  asnow.     After  twelve  years  of  seemingly  almost171172         THE  CALL  TO  AMERICAfruitless  struggle  Mr.  Cyrus  Field  had  made  in1866  his  last  successful  effort.  Just  before  thestarting  of  the  Great  Eastern  with  the  cable  onboard,  a  number  of  clergymen  had1  been  invitedto  Valencia  to  inaugurate  with  appropriate  religious  services  the  undertaking.  Among  those  invited  had  been  my  father;  and  it  was  with  a  feeling  akin  to  awe  that  this  cable  message  a  fewmonths  later  was  viewed  in  the  family  circle.Among  the  household  treasures  was  a  piece  ofthe  cable,  and  a  finely  illustrated  history  of  theundertaking.  These  were  all  again  examinedand  admired  in  the  light  of  this  practical  exampleof  the  efficiency  of  the  Atlantic  cable.This  message  came  on  the  ist  of  August,  1867,and  was  at  once  taken  into  grave  consideration.Many  things  had  to  be  weighed  on  both  sides.The  aged  mother  in  the  north  of  Ireland  wasdeeply  moved  at  the  mere  prospect  of  having  thegreat  ocean  part  her  in  her  declining  days  fromthe  son  on  whom  she  now  gladly  and  freelyleaned.  Her  one  comfort  was  that,  "he  wouldbe  preaching  to  many  nations,  and  that  thoughher  hope  he  would  have  been  a  missionary  wasnot  fulfilled,  that  yet  at  least  his  voice  wouldbring  the  gospel  to  distant  parts."Had  all  the  love  and  affection  been  made  man-AND  ITS  ACCEPTANCE  173ifest  that  later  years  proved  existed,  the  partingfrom  Ireland  would  have  been  far  harder,  andthe  path  of  duty  less  plain.  But  my  father  felt,and  to  an  inner  circle  guardedly  said,  that  hissympathies  were  with  a  set  of  ideas  and  a  policyplainly  not  favored  by  the  General  Assembly  asa  body.  He  was  an  outspoken  Liberal  ;  the  policyof  the  Assembly  was  to  work  with  the  Toryparty  in  the  great  issues  at  least.  He  was  fordisestablishment  and  thorough  disestablishmentat  that;  the  Assembly  was — as  seen  in  its  actionof  1868 — on  the  other  side.  He  was  on  the  sideof  secular  and  undenominational  education;  theAssembly  was  not  heartily  in  favor  of  it,  althoughassenting  with  constant,  and  often  unjust  criticisms  of  their  representatives  on  the  NationalBoard  of  Education.  My  father  had  no  objectionto  either  organ  or  hymns,  but  these  were  theburning  questions — hardly  settled  yet — on  whicha  triumphant  majority  were  glad  year  after  yearto  assert  their  power  to  stop  progress  by  destructive  conservatism.  Along  many  lines  myfather  had  been  calling  down  the  criticisms  of  the"pillars"  and  "safe"  counsellors  in  the  churchby  demands  for  reforms  in  Sabbath-school  teaching,  by  his  temperance  activity  and  by  pleas  tocarry  on  the  evangelization  of  Ireland  along  thei74         THE  CALL  TO  AMERICAlines  laid  down  by  Dr.  Edgar.  There  was  littleor  no  opposition  of  an  open  kind  to  my  father'srestless  activity  along  these  and  other  lines;  butthere  was  a  steady  quiet  suppressing  of  his  energy.  He  longed  for  "more  atmosphere,"  andsaid  so  confidentially  to  an  inner  circle.  Yet  heloved  Ireland,  and  he  loved  Dublin.  He  clungwith  a  tender  and  unceasing  affection,  not  onlyto  a  little  band  of  ministerial  friends,  but  to  numberless  families  all  over  the  country.  In  Belfast,in  Newry,  in  Cork  as  well  as  in  Dublin  his  heartwas  bound  by  sweet  and  lasting  bonds  to  Christian  friends,  whom  he  never  forgot,  and  whonever  forgot  or  betrayed  him.Great  as  was  the  pressure  put  upon  him  to  accept  the  call  voices  were  at  the  same  timelifted  up  by  intimate  friends  both  in  Irelandand  in  America  urging  him  to  consider  thestep  carefully.  His  oldest  and  dearest  friendwrote:MY  DEAR  HALL:It  is  not  my  place,  of  course,  to  interfere  in  that  mostserious  business  of  your  going  to  New  York.  Serious  it  is,  inalmost  every  aspect  of  it.  I  know  quite  well  you  are  not  theman  to  act  from  impulse,  and  that  you  have  deliberatelyweighed  the  matter  in  all  its  bearings.  I  am  not  certainwhether  you  have  irrevocably  pledged  yourself  to  go,  nor  do  Iwish  you  to  tell  me  whether  you  have  or  not.  But,  if  you  haveNOT,  I  beseech  you  to  consider  the  position  of  responsibility  andAND  ITS  ACCEPTANCE  175influence  that  God  has  assigned  you  in  the  present  crisis  of  ourecclesiastical  and  national  history.  You  are,  I  am  quite  sure,satisfied  that  some  of  the  gravest  questions  that  have  ever  beendiscussed  in  our  church  in  our  time,  are  certain  to  come  upvery  soon.  You  are  needed.  You  know  I  am  never  given  toflattery.  But  I  only  say  what  I  think,  and  what  I  have  very,very  often  said  to  others,  that  of  all  the  men  in  our  church,  youare  the  man,  I  would  say,  we  cannot  spare.  God  is  not  tied  toany  individual  instrument,  it  is  true.  But  seeing  He  condescends  to  raise  up,  and  to  qualify  instruments  for  His  ownwork,  we  are  not  dishonoring  nor  disturbing  Him  when  werecognize  the  qualifications  for  special  service,  He  has  Himselfbestowed.  ...  I  write  in  confidence,  I  am  not  mentioningeven  to  my  wife  that  I  am  writing  to  you.  It  is  as  well  not.I  can  speak  more  freely.  There  will  be  only  one  feeling  inDr.  Kirkpatrick's  family  should  you  go — of  deep  and  poignantsorrow.  Those  young  people  are  all  exceedingly  attached  toyou.  I  know  these  are  small  matters,  but  I  can  at  least  do  noharm  to  mention  them.The  one  thing  that  weighs  upon  my  mind  is,  that  you  aremore  needed  for,  and  I  think,  considering  everything,  morefitted  for,  working  in  the  land  of  your  birth  (first  and  second)than  in  any  country  under  heaven.  If  the  Lord  still  opens  upyour  way  to  remain  among  us,  no  one  will  be  more  gratifiedthan  your  old  college  friend,  H.  MAGEE.To  J.  Hall,Aug.  ifth,  1867.From  an  Irish  friend  then  in  America  and  familiar  with  conditions  in  New  York  and  even  insome  degree  with  the  conditions  in  the  churchhe  asked  for  "  the  gloomy  side  "  of  the  call,and  received  a  very  sober  and  careful  letter,  ofwhich  some  abstracts  may  be  interesting.176         THE  CALL  TO  AMERICA"DEAR  DR.  HALL  :  —*****"  August  gth,  1867."  You  will  understand  that  my  object  is  to  laybefore  you  such  facts  regarding  this  country  andthe  church  as,  I  think  might  influence  your  decision  as  to  coming  out  here,  and  I  will  do  it  asfairly  as  I  can,  for  I  would  not  on  my  accountdesire  you  to  come  out  and  then  be  disappointedby  finding  anything  different  from  what  you  hadexpected,  and  yet  I  cannot  tell  you  how  thankfulI  should  feel  personally  if  the  Father  should  in  Hiskind  providence  bring  you  here  while  we  arestill  here."In  the  first  place  the  church  has  not  been  ina  very  satisfactory  state.  Some  did  not  treat  Dr.Rice  at  all  as  they  ought  to  have  done,  and  theone  who  took  the  lead  was     whom  youhave  met.  Some  particularly  desired  anothercandidate  when  Dr.  Rice  was  elected,  and  theynever,  therefore,  were  favorably  disposed  tohim.  Besides,  he  came  at  the  beginning  of  thewar.  He  was  a  Kentuckian  by  birth,  and  hiswife  and  most  of  his  friends  were  southern  people,  and  his  not  preaching  political  sermons  wasconstrued  by  his  enemies  into  a  sympathy  forthe  south.  But  it  was  really  only  a  few  of  theAND  ITS  ACCEPTANCE  177extremists  carried  away  by  the  excitement  andpassion  of  the  moment,  who  turned  against  him.The  great  mass  of  the  church  did  not  want  political  preaching,  nay,  they  were  very  thankfulnot  to  have  it.  They  loved  the  noble  old  doctormost  intensely,  no  one  had  any  idea  how  intensely,  until  he  was  compelled  to  leave  them.They  would  have  done  anything  to  have  retainedhis  connection  with  the  church.  But  he  wouldnot  remain  while  he  could  not  work  and  he  wascompletely  broken  down.  Of  his  own  free  willhe  resigned,  greatly  to  the  sorrow  of  the  greatportion  of  the  congregation.  In  your  case  however  the  church  is  perfectly  unanimous,  and  youcome  without  being  mixed  up  with  either  political  party.  ...  I  fear  however  should  youcome  out  you  will  miss  very  much  the  congenialcircle  of  ministers  which  you  must  break  fromin  leaving  Dublin.  You  will  find  a  prejudiceagainst  you  in  the  minds  of  some  of  the  smallerclergymen  here.  It  is  natural  that  they  shouldfeel  slighted  by  a  call  being  given  to  you  a  foreigner,  which  to  some  extent  will  be  strengthenedby  the  prejudice  against  Irishmen  in  particular;and  there  is  a  strong  party,  both  in  the  Presbyterian  church  and  out  of  it  called  the  'NativeAmerican  '  party,  who  would  not  scruple  to  use178         THE  CALL  TO  AMERICAthe  cry  of  foreign  birth  against  you,  if  it  suitedtheir  ends,  and  any  cry  of  this  kind  is  dangerouswith  a  people  like  the  Americans,  who  are  naturally  illogical  and  impulsive,  and  therefore  dogmatic  and  apt  to  be  carried  away  by  their  feelingsso  as  to  see  the  end  aimed  at  only,  and  for  meansdo,  what,  after  calmer  consideration  they  aresorry  for."  As  to  America  itself  (remember  I  am  tryingto  bring  up  all  the  objections  I  can  at  present)you  would  be  much  pained  by  the  toadyism  tothe  moneyed  aristocracy  (by  far  the  worst  kindof  an  aristocracy)  and  by  the  purse-proudness  ofmany  (even  among  Christians)  and  by  the  general  feeling  of  the  omnipotence  of  the  Almightydollar."The  education  of  your  children  would,  Ithink,  be  another  serious  obstacle.  I  would  behooted  at  for  hinting  at  such  a  thing,  but  my  feeling  is  that  here  the  education  is  very  superficial;though  1  confess  I  do  not  intimately  know  it,  butonly  the  results.  .  .  .  Again  the  rates  of  living  are  so  high  that  in  Ireland  I  believe  one  couldbe  more  comfortable  on  ^£500  than  on  ^1,000here,  and  in  many  things  the  tastes,  feelings  andideas  of  Americans  so  differ  from  ours,  that  Ithink  you  would  never  be  so  happy  here  as  inAND  ITS  ACCEPTANCE  179Ireland,  and  indeed  I  believe  it  would  be  a  personal  sacrifice  your  coming  out  here,  whichshould  only  be  made  in  consideration  of  the  important  place  you  are  called  to  fill,  believing  thatit  is  the  Master's  call,  and  that  it  is  He  who  hasopened  such  a  wide  field  for  you  to  labor  in."Not  all  the  letter  is  quite  in  this  strain,  at  thesame  time  other  and  personal  considerations  aredwelt  upon.  My  father  had  in  no  way  committed  himself  in  his  letters  to  Mr.  Stuart  and  atone  point  in  his  deliberations  words  from  certainquarters  urging  him  to  stay  would,  probablyhave  decided  him  for  Ireland.  Those  wordswere  not  spoken.  He  felt  that  he  could  bespared,  and  that  the  call  from  over  the  waterwas  the  voice  of  Providence,  and  he  said  finally"yes."The  moment  that  word  was  spoken  there  wassuch  a  tremendous  appeal  made,  and  such  acommotion  in  many  circles  that  my  father  wasfairly  stunned.  He  had  always  with  the  utmostvigor  upheld  Presbyterianism  against  the  claims,often  he  thought  haughty  and  arrogant,  of  theEstablished  Church.  Courteously  yet  firmly  andconstantly  he  battled  for  what  he  considered  amore  thoroughgoing  and  scriptural  Protestantismthan  the  somewhat  High  Church  Establishment.i8o         THE  CALL  TO  AMERICAWhat  then  was  his  pleasure  and  his  astonishmentto  find  some  of  the  very  warmest  and  strongestprotests  against  his  going  coming  from  thosewhom  he  had  already  begun  to  put  his  armoron  to  fight.  The  Roman  Catholics  had  goodwords  for  him,  and  letters  came  from  far-offConnaught  asking  that  he  stay  and  fight  out  thebattle  of  the  spelling-book  which  he  had  sobravely  carried  on.  The  disestablishment  partyin  the  church  saw  their  supposed  feeble  minorityleft  without  a  leader;  and  now  earnest  wordswere  spoken  by  even  those  whose  oppositionand  silence  had  made  my  father  feel  that  as  ayoung  man  in  a  very  leading  position  his  placewas  one  of  great  difficulty,  even  to  the  imperilling  the  peace  of  the  church.  He  profoundly  feltthat  after  the  struggles  in  which  the  church  hadbeen  engaged,  and  in  the  face  of  the  difficultieswithout,  peace  within  was  a  first  necessity.To  secure  that  peace  was  one  of  the  motives  thatled  him  to  be  willing  to  go.  Now  he  had  said"yes,"  and  all  protests  were  in  vain.  Friends  ofmy  father — I  never  heard  him  himself  complainof  it, — felt  that  the  Rutland  Square  congregationhad  not  dealt  generously  with  him.  He  had  madepecuniary  sacrifices  to  come  to  them.  WhenMr.  Findlater  built  the  church  he  distinctly  inti-AND  ITS  ACCEPTANCE  181mated,  in  the  letter  already  quoted,  that  he  expected  the  congregation  to  support  the  ministryliberally.  There  had  been  no  adequate  recognition  of  the  greatly  increased  labors  flung  on  theshoulders  of  the  younger  man,  by  the  larger  congregation  and  the  declining  strength  of  Dr.Kirkpatrick.  Now  that  he  was  going  the  mistake  was  seen,  but  it  was  too  late.  It  only  remained  by  great  public  meetings  and  addresses,as  well  as  by  memorial  silver  to  show  howstrongly  fastened  were  the  ties  that  bound  thepastor  to  the  people  he  was  so  soon  to  leave.To  his  friend  Dr.  Magee  he  wrote  at  once  saying :MY  DEAR  FRIEND  :ii  Eccles  Street,  Dublin,i8th  August,  7867.Your  kind  letter  certainly  moved  my  feelings  very  much,though  my  judgment  remains  as  I  had  formed  it  after  a  carefuland  serious  survey  of  all  the  circumstances  which  a  ministershould  take  into  view  in  determining  his  duty  in  a  case  of  thiskind.  Everything  that  formed  a  reason  for  my  coming  toDublin  has  its  stronger  counterpart  in  reference  to  New  York.If  the  Church  is  apparently  dependent  on  such  men  as  I  am,remaining,  it  may  be  the  best  discipline  for  her  in  the  presenttemper  of  the  majority  of  her  members  to  have  a  few  such  removed.  I  am  sensible  of  the  strength  of  the  case  made  by  theRutland  Square  people,  but  then  any  circumstance  of  ease,comfort,  society  or  business  would  withdraw  any  family  amongthem  from  us.  Many  whom  I  know  most  as  friends  are  providentially  removed  or  removing  and  I  should  have  only  to  do  indetail,  what  is  now  to  be  done  with  much  pain  to  myself  atonce.  I  always  valued — much  more  than  I  can  say — the182         THE  CALL  TO  AMERICAsympathy  and  affection  of  a  few  college  friends  among  whomyou  stand  in  a  foremost  place,  but  I  often  felt  as  if  the  prominence  of  the  place  I  was,  without  any  fault  of  mine,  put  in,and  the  multiplicity  of  duties  to  be  done,  deprived  me  of  theenjoyment  of  as  much  of  this  blessing  as  I  might  otherwisehave  had.  I  am  glad  of  the  good-feeling  of  the  young  people,to  which  you  kindly  allude,  but  I  do  not  think  it  would  be  atall  just  to  Dr.  Kirkpatrick  and  myself  to  alter  the  opinion  I  hadformed,  and  in  some  measure  indicated,  on  account  of  the  newproposals.1  He  and  perhaps  some  others — of  whom  I  knowyou  were  not  one — blamed  me  for  setting  him  aside  (or  sanctioning  that  course)  partially — how  much  more  if  I  were  aparty  to  doing  it  altogether?  Nor,  in  other  points  of  view,would  the  proposed  arrangement  long  continue  consistentlywith  our  self-respect,  independence  of  feeling,  and  generalcomfort.  But  my  reason  for  going,  though  founded  on  a  conjoint  view  of  all  the  circumstances,  rest  more  on  the  facts  inconnexion  with  New  York,  and  if  spared  to  live  and  laborthere,  I  shall  always  retain  the  friendships  of  other  and  lesscare-laden  times,  and  always  be  to  you  as  I  am  sure  you  willbe  to  me  a  sympathizing,  cordially  appreciating,  college  andChristian  friend,J.  HALL.Meantime  letters  in  abundance  pressing  theclaims  of  the  Fifth  Avenue  Presbyterian  Churchcame  to  hand,  and  the  news  of  the  hearty  character  of  the  call  gave  an  additional  reason  forprompt  acceptance.  The  session  of  the  Churchhad  issued  a  circular  to  the  members  who  werescattered  for  the  vacation,  as  follows:1  Dr.  Kirkpatrick  had  intimated  generously  to  the  congregation  that  he  was  ready  to  step  aside  to  enable  them  to  retain  hisfellow-minister.AND  ITS  ACCEPTANCE  183NEW  YORK,  July  18, 1867.DEAR  SIR  :The  Session  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  on  Fifth  Avenue,corner  of  Nineteenth  Street,  respectfully  calls  your  attention  tothe  communication  which  follows  :Those  members  of  the  congregation  who  have  had  the  opportunity  of  hearing  the  REV.  DR.  HALL,  of  Dublin,  preach,have,  we  believe,  without  exception,  expressed  a  desire  that  heshould  be  called  to  our  Church.  In  the  scattered  condition  ofour  congregation,  usual  at  this  season  of  the  year,  we  do  notfeel  justified  in  calling  a  meeting  to  consider  the  subject  without  giving  an  opportunity  to  all  members  of  the  congregationto  be  present,  and  to  express  their  views.We,  therefore,  take  this  method  of  informing  you  that  ameeting  of  the  congregation  will  be  held  on  WEDNESDAYEVENING,  JULY  3 1st,  at  the  Lecture  Room  of  the  Church,  athalf-past  seven  o'  clock.At  that  meeting  it  is  our  intention  to  nominate  Rev.  JohnHall,  D.  D.,  as  Pastor  of  our  Church,  and  to  recommend  himmost  cordially.We  are  happy  to  say  that  we  have  encouragement  to  believethat  he  will  accept  a  call  from  us,  if  he  can  obtain  the  consentof  his  people.The  circumstances  of  the  case,  are,  in  our  judgment,  such  asto  make  EARLY  ACTION  necessary.If,  from  any  cause,  you  should  be  unable  to  attend  the  meeting,you  will  very  much  oblige  us  by  addressing  a  note  to  WilliamWalker,   No.  69  Liberty  Street,  or  either  of  the   undersigned,Stating  your  approval  or  disapproval  of  the  proposed  call.We  are,Yours  respectfully,WILLIAM  WALKER,THOMAS  U.

DE  FOREST,HENRY  DAY.184         THE  CALL  TO  AMERICAThe  official  letter  giving  notice  of  the  formalcall  and  enclosing  the  papers  was  delayed,  butthe  clerk  of  the  session,  and  the  lifelong  friendof  my  father,  Mr.  William  Walker,  sent  at  oncea  letter  stating  the  full  result.  The  letter  read:MY  DEAR  SIR  :NEW  YORK,  Aug.  i,  1867.I  have  but  little  time  before  the  sailing  of  the  steamer  tostate  that  we  had  an  unexpectedly  large  meeting  of  our  congregation  last  evening,  and  with  entire  unanimity  a  call  wasmade  out  for  you.  I  received  in  addition  about  forty  letters(representing  probably  seventy-five  persons,)  from  those  whocould  not  be  present  at  the  meeting  expressing  their  cordial  approval  of  the  proposed  call.The  moderator  was  pleased  to  say  that  he  had  never  beenpresent  at  a  congregational  meeting  so  perfectly  harmonious  intheir  views.The  salary  proposed  is  $6,000  in  gold  and  the  free  occupation  of  a  suitable  dwelling-house.  In  addition  the  trusteeswere  instructed  to  pay  the  expense  of  bringing  your  familyhere.I  telegraphed  you  this  day  informing  you  of  the  call.The  necessary  papers  will  be  forwarded  as  soon  as  they  canbe  prepared.With  the  earnest  prayer  that  your  decision  may  be  such  thatGod  may  be  glorified  and  His  cause  promoted,  I  am  very  trulyYour  brother  in  Christ,WM.  WALKER.To  this  letter  my  father  replied  as  below:MY  DEAR  SIR  :DUBLIN,  zoth  August,  iSbj.I  have  received  your  kind  communication  and  severalothers  on  the  same  subject.  I  have  weighed  with  much  concernAND  ITS  ACCEPTANCE  185all  the  circumstances  of  which  I  think  a  minister  should  take  account  in  forming  his  judgment,  and  I  see  no  reason  to  alter  theopinion  of  which  you  and  other  friends  have  had  indicationsalready,  that  I  should  accept  the  invitation  of  your  Church  andremove  to  New  York.  The  fact  that  I  did  not  take  any  steptowards  a  settlement  in  America,  that  I  never  contemplated  it,the  great  and  commanding  importance  of  the  field,  the  unanimity  of  the  members,  and  the  urgent  counsel  of  leading  ministers  of  the  American  Church  are  among  the  principal  reasonsthat  have  led  me — through  a  most  painful  struggle  with  feelingsof  personal  and  local  attachment — to  this  conclusion.I  have  intimated  my  opinion  to  the  congregation  of  RutlandSquare  through  the  Session,  and  upon  their  taking  certain  stepsand  begging  my  reconsideration  of  the  case,  I  have  again  reported  my  unaltered  opinion  to  them.  I  shall  be  guided  bytheir  convenience  (as  my  colleague  is  just  now  in  Amsterdamat  the  Evangelical  Alliance  Conference),  as  to  the  time  of  asking  the  leave  of  the  presbytery  to  resign  ;  but  this,  and  I  trustall  other  necessary  steps  can  be  taken  so  as  to  admit  of  my  removal  to  New  York  with  my  family  during  the  month  ofOctober.  The  probable  time  of  the  equinoctial  gales,  thetime  of  a  suitable  steamer's  sailing  and  other  circumstancesmust  determine  the  exact  time  of  the  month,  and  of  thisyou  shall  have  the  earliest  intimation  possible  in  course  ofpost. The  cordial  and  harmonious  action  of  the  people  is  I  trustan  indication  that  this  thing  is  of  the  Lord,  and  I  hope  theywill  not  fail  to  beseech  Him  to  crown  the  arrangement  withHis  own  blessing.  I  am  deeply  sensible  of  the  importance  ofthe  work  to  which  I  go,  and  I  shall  enter  upon  it  in  dependenceon  Divine  aid,  and  in  expectation  of  that  confidence  and  cooperation  of  Session  and  congregation  of  which  it  has  been  myhappiness  to  enjoy  so  much  hitherto.  Believe  me  to  be,  dearMr.  Walker,Yours  most  faithfully  in  the  truth,WM.  WALKER.  ESQUIRE.JOHN  HALL.i86         THE  CALL  TO  AMERICAThe  parting  from  Dublin  was  made  very  serious  by  the  expressions  on  every  hand  of  the  lossthe  Church  at  large  and  the  city  sustained.  Manyinterests  had  to  be  cared  for.  The  EvangelicalWitness  passed  into  other  hands,  and  became  aweekly  paper  of  great  power,  and  is  still  theleading  organ  of  the  Presbyterian  church  as  theBelfast  Witness.  The  national  education  causeinterested  my  father  to  the  end  of  his  life,  and  hesaw  the  complete  triumph  of  his  views  beforemany  years  had  passed.  The  Episcopal  churchwas  disestablished,  and,  as  he  had  predicted,prospered  as  never  before  on  that  very  account.National  education  won  its  way  and  compelledthe  adhesion  of  even  the  extreme  Roman  Catholic  party.  The  Presbyterians  flung  off  the  leading  strings  of  the  Tory  party  and  became  intelligently  and  independently  liberal,  securing  theirown  representation  in  the  House  of  Commons,and  ceasing  from  that  day  on  to  be  the  mere"tail  to  the  Tory  kite."It  would  be,  at  this  date,  impossible  to  reproduce  and  tiresome  to  attempt  it,  the  manyprinted  estimates  and  criticisms  of  the  eighteenyears  of  public  service  in  Ireland.  Yet  one  estimate  in  the  Evangelical  Witness  after  it  hadpassed  from  under  his  control  is  worth  repro-AND  ITS  ACCEPTANCE  187duction,  as  it  is  from  the  pen  of  the  Rev.  ThomasCroskerry  of  Londonderry,  who  at  that  timewielded  large  influence  and  whose  services  inconnection  with  the  Evangelical  Witness  are  stillfresh  in  the  minds  of  Irish  readers.  The  articlecondensed  somewhat  was  as  follows:THE  REV.  DR.  HALL."  Our  gifted  predecessor,  after  a  brief  but  distinguished  ministry  of  eighteen  years,  has  left  hisnative  country  to  spend  the  remainder  of  hisdays  in  the  service  of  American  Presbyterianism.His  departure  is  a  subject  of  universal  and  unfeigned  regret.  It  is,  however,  a  subject  of  justpride  and  congratulation  that  he  will  nobly  represent,  in  another  land,  the  power  and  versatilityof  that  Scotch-Irish  race  which  the  historian,Bancroft,  has  glorified  in  connection  with  thecivil  and  ecclesiastical  history  of  America.  It  isalmost  unnecessary  to  say  to  Irish  Presbyterianswhat  Dr.  Hall  was  to  the  church  of  his  fathers.The  pulpit  was  the  throne  of  his  power.  Hewas  no  talker  of  drawling  platitudes  or  explanatory  futilities,  with  affected  rhetoric  or  artificialturns  of  phrase,  or  mental  inanity,  whose  sermons  act  upon  part  of  a  congregation  like  chloroform,  while  they  drive  another  portion  into188         THE  CALL  TO  AMERICAthinking  of  nothing,  a  third  into  wonderingwhen  the  preacher  will  be  done,  a  fourth  intoill-natured  criticism,  and  a  fifth  out  of  church  altogether.  He  was  something  more  than  a  merepounder  of  texts  in  a  doctrinal  mortar;  something  more  than  a  dry,  didactic  talker  after  modesbeaten  flat  by  the  incessant  hammering  of  centuries.  In  fact,  Dr.  Hall  was  one  of  the  freshestpreachers  of  the  age.  He  preached,  too,  as  hetalked,  with  a  fine  conversational  freedom  andnaturalness,  and  was  so  singularly  lucid  andhappy  in  expression  that  he  was,  to  our  mind,the  Goldsmith  and  Franklin,  in  one,  of  the  Irishpulpit.  His  sermons — some  of  them,  if  rumor  isto  be  credited,  like  Jonah's  gourd,  the  offspringof  a  single  night — are  powerful  from  their  heavenly  unction,  their  beseeching  tenderness,  theirpopular  scope,  and,  above  all,  their  wide  rangeof  analogical  illustration.  He  was,  indeed,  singularly  skillful  in  analogies,  in  the  structure  ofthose  '  aerial  pontoons  '  which  bridge  across  theliteral  and  the  figurative.  It  is,  perhaps,  thehighest  praise  of  Dr.  Hall's  sermons  and  speechesthat  they  do  not  read  well,  for  it  is  a  well-knownfact  that  the  newspaper  speech  which  is  polishedand  rounded,  and  Ciceronian  in  its  periods,  isanything  but  popular  or  pleasing  to  an  audience.AND  ITS  ACCEPTANCE  189We  must  say,  however,  that  the  speeches  of  ourgifted  friend  were  such  fresh  and  familiar  transcripts  of  good  sense  and  feeling,  with  a  certainrich  zest  and  flavor  and  power  about  them,  thatthe  reader  could  always  associate  the  image  ofthe  speaker  with  every  paragraph,  and  his  earseemed  to  catch  and  recognize  the  very  tones  ofliving  address.  His  speeches  were  always  short.Let  it  be  said  to  his  credit  that  he  always  exhibited,  in  debate,  a  high-bred  Christian  courtesy,and  that  he  abstained  from  all  those  weapons  offierce  and  sarcastic  recrimination  which  do  somuch  to  lower  the  moral  status  as  well  as  lessenthe  influence  of  the  ministry."We  cannot  well  estimate  the  amount  of  hisvarious  labors  for  our  denominational  benefit,whether  as  a  preacher,  as  a  journalist,  or  as  adirector  of  education.  For  six  years,  in  the  midstof  endless  concerns  of  public  and  private  urgency,  in  the  metropolis  of  the  country,  wherehe  was  surrounded  by  all  the  social  temptations  ofthe  popular  preacher,  he  sustained  the  Evangelical  Witness,  without  a  farthing  of  help  frompublic  or  private  funds,  and  did  vast  service  tothe  Presbyterian  cause  by  defending  and  explaining  Presbyterianism,  by  correcting  the  errors  andchastising  the  heresies  of  the  times,  by  rebukingTHE  CALL  TO  AMERICAthe  exclusiveness  and  intolerance  of  Churchmen,and,  above  all,  by  cherishing  the  literary  spiritin  our  ministers.  For  nine  years,  he  was  occupied  in  raising  Dublin  Presbyterianism  to  thatproud  and  commanding  position  it  held  in  thedays  when  Joseph  Boyse  preached  to  a  thousandhearers  in  Wood  Street,  including  the  Darners,and  Langfords,  and  Loftuses,  of  high  descent;and  for  eighteen  years  he  has  been  conspicuous,in  the  ranks  of  his  brethren,  not  merely  for  greateloquence  and  great  force  of  character,  but  as  aman  of  unblemished  integrity,  of  tried  courage,of  large  benevolence,  of  unaffected  piety — a  manwhose  views  were  always  tolerant  and  liberal,his  convictions  deep  and  hearty,  with  few  antipathies  and  many  sympathies,  yet  his  career,  inall  its  stages,  marked  by  decision.  We  can  thinkof  his  life  proudly  and  thankfully,  as  of  thecourse  of  a  river  filling  its  channel  from  bank  tobank,  moving  onwards  by  the  force  of  its  ownample  stream,  and,  with  effortless  ministry,watering  the  fields  and  the  flowers  on  eitherside."VIII.

PASTORAL  WORK.IT  was  a  beautiful  warm  autumn  day  whenafter  a  long,  but  on  the  whole  pleasant  trip,the  extra  Cunard  Steamship  Aleppo  broughtmy  father  and  his  family  to  the  dock  at  NewYork.  A  long-trusted  and  loved  housekeeperand  two  servants  accompanied  the  party.  Thefour  little  boys  all  arrayed  in  Scotch  caps  and  thebelts  and  blouses  worn  in  those  days  by  schoolchildren  in  Ireland,  but  unknown  in  America,  aresaid  to  have  attracted  an  attention  of  which  thewearers  were  happily  unconscious.  Nothingcould  have  exceeded  the  kindness  and  thought-fulness  of  those  who  had  made  provision  for  thecomfort  of  the  future  minister.  The  dwelling-house  was  in  every  way  suitable,  and  was  mostfitly  furnished.  In  a  letter  of  that  year  (9th  ofDecember,  1867),  the  impressions  made  are  described  in  a  letter  to  Dr.  Hamilton  Magee  :i94  THE  MINISTRY  INMY  DEAR  FRIEND  :As  I  write  in  the  dining-room,  the  living-room  of  our  house,for  here  the  drawing-room  is  called  "  parlor,"  you  and  the  otherbrethren  look  down  on  me  from  over  the  clock,  and  recall  allthe  days  and  evenings  of  labor  and  enjoyment  in  Dublin.  TheLord's  goodness  has  been  signal  and  conspicuous.  I  feel  asmuch  at  home  as  if  the  weeks  had  been  months,  to  say  the  leastof  it.  Our  communion — held  yesterday — was  exceedinglypleasant,  very  like  Rutland  Square,  only  that  the  afternoontime  is  given  to  it.  We  received  about  thirty  new  communicants,  nearly  twenty  of  them  on  profession  of  faith  which,  insome  instances  is  made  at  an  age  we  should  count  childhood  athome.  I  have  begun  with  ordinary  sermons  that  I  might  notpitch  the  standard  of  expectation  higher  than  I  could  honestlykeep  up — have  eschewed  all  attempts  at  sensationalism,  and  toldthe  people  that  our  reliance  must  be  upon  the  steady,  patientteaching  of  divine  truth.  So  far  the  Church  displays  all  thesigns  of  interest.  The  building  is  comfortable  ;  the  elders,  Ithink  right-minded  men,  and  I  suppose  I  have  heard  as  manyas  twenty  or  thirty  laymen  offer  up  prayer  in  public  very  appropriately.  There  is  a  fine  field  here  for  work,  and  a  readiness  I  think  to  value  an  evangelical  ministry.  I  hope  to  begina  down-town  mission  service  on  Friday  evenings —  we  live  "  uptown."  This  I  find  surprises  the  folk,  the  approved  wayhitherto  being  for  the  up-town  people  to  pay  students,  etc.,  to  dothis  work.  Mission-schools  are  the  hobby  of  our  congregation,and  they  are  good,  but  skilled  labor  is  a  little  wanted.  I  hopeto  begin  my  Bible-class  for  ladies  by  the  opening  of  the  year.Preparation  is  no  more  difficult  here  than  at  home,  and  I  havewritten  several  sermons — strange  as  it  may  seem — since  Icame  !Now   I  want  you  to  tell  the  dear  brethren  of  the  ministers'meeting — that  I  am  trying  to  be  what  they  would  have  me  (be)as  their  representative  in  New  York.     .     .     .Ever,  my  dear  Hamilton,Your  affectionate  friend,J.  HALL.NINETEENTH  STREET  CHURCH    195The  Church  itself  had  had  a  most  honorablehistory  which  perhaps  had  up  to  that  timereached  its  climax  in  the  long  and  most  successful  ministry  of  Dr.  James  Alexander,  the  immediate  predecessor  of  Dr.  Rice,  whose  failing  health,and,  perhaps,  supposed  southern  sympathies,  hadprevented  his  undoubted  worth  and  ability  beingfully  recognized.  The  war  had  closed,  and  manysouthern  people  found  themselves  attracted  bythe  theology  of  the  Old  School  to  which  wing  theChurch  naturally  had  belonged,  and  by  the  factthat  Dr.  Rice  did  not  say  anything  that  was  likelyto  wound  their  feelings.  There  were  howeveralso  intensely  northern  partisans.  It  was  thegood  fortune  of  the  Church  to  secure  as  a  minister  one  who  could  unite  both  wings.  The  congregation  had  worshipped  in  several  buildings.The  old  Cedar  Street  Church  having  been  built  in1808.  Then  the  Church  moved  to  Duane  Street,which  building  was  erected  in  1835.  In  1852  anew  building  on  Fifth  Avenue  and  NineteenthStreet  was  entered,  and  in  this  building  my  fatherbegan  his  New  York  ministry.  The  Church  stillis  used  having  been  moved  stone  by  stone  toFifty-seventh  Street  near  Eighth  Avenue,  wherewith  some  changes  it  stands  as  in  the  formerdays.  The  traditions  of  the  Church  carried  it196  THE  MINISTRY  INover  to  the  Old  School,  but  in  the  congregationwere  New  School  men,  attracted  by  the  eloquence  and  the  learning  of  Dr.  Alexander.  Hereagain  it  was  my  father's  good  fortune  to  be  identified  in  no  way  with  the  old  dispute.  Naturallyattracted  to  the  older  theology,  he  found  muchthat  was  sympathetic  in  the  warmer  evangelicalspirit  of  the  New  School  thought.  Of  AlbertBarnes  he  once  wrote  :  l"And  then  came  the  end  of  Albert  Barnes'labors.  It  was  like  the  life  that  preceded  it,  lifeand  death  of  a  piece.  Meek,  laborious,  systematic,  gentle,  he  sat  in  the  chair  of  a  departedfriend  to  give  comfort  to  the  survivors,  when  theLord's  messenger  touched  him,  and  said,  'Arise,and  follow  me;'  and  he  arose  and  enteredthrough  the  gates  into  the  city,  wondering,  wemay  well  believe,  whether  it  was  a  vision,  orwhether  that  was  true  which  was  done  by  theangel.  But  it  was  soon  all  real  ;  all  happy  ;  allhomelike;  'absent  from  the  body,  and  at  homewith  the  Lord.'"For  Dr.  William  Adams'  affection  and  admiration  mingled  from  their  first  meeting  at  the  NewSchool  Assembly  in  Rochester  in  1867  to  the  closeof  Dr.  Adams'  life.  The  stately  dignity  of  the1  The  American  Messenger,  March,  1871.NINETEENTH  STREET  CHURCH     197man,  together  with  the  gentle  pervasive  courtesyin  tone  and  manner  that  so  distinguished  thegreat  New  School  leader,  appealed  with  specialpower  to  my  father.  Quite  frequently,  particularly  in  his  earlier  experience  in  America  he  wasoffended  by  the  "slap-dash,  slap-on-the-back  "(as  he  called  it)  type  of  minister,  who  mistakesrude  familiarity  for  ease,  and  substitutes  brusque-ness  for  straightforwardness.  He  had  beennaturally  thrown  as  a  delegate  from  Ireland  intoconnection  with  both  Assemblies,  and  the  attachments  thus  formed  he  used  to  good  effect  inthe  following  years  of  rapid  approach  on  thepart  of  the  two  Assemblies.Already  in  1867  men  were  talking  about  a  possible  reunion  of  the  Church.  It  was  impossiblefor  one  coming  so  recently  to  the  country  to  takewith  good  grace  any  leading  part  in  such  a  movement.  Yet  it  was  with  earnest  and  hopefulsolicitude  that  he  watched  each  step  towards  sucha  consummation,  and  no  one  rejoiced  more  sincerely  in  the  ultimate  result  than  did  the  newcomer  to  American  shores.  The  union  was  completed  in  1869  when  at  Pittsburg  the  two  Assemblies  came  together,  and  on  the  plan  ofmutual  forbearance  and  reasonable  liberty  theChurch  became  one.  In  accordance  with  his  in-198  THE  MINISTRY  INstincts  my  father  turned  at  once  to  the  UnitedChurch  for  a  better  support  for  educational  institutions,  and  particularly  for  a  larger  and  deeperconception  of  the  culture  and  learning  needed  inthe  ministry.  In  an  appeal  to  the  United  Church,headed,  "What  Next?"  he  urged  the  chief  advantages  of  the  reunion.  He  asked  in  thecolumns  of  the  Evangelist,"And  for  what  are  we  one  ?  To  overshadowor  absorb  other  churches  ?  No.  That  were  apoor  and  unchristian  ambition.  Let  our  Methodist  brethren  cry  aloud  '  ye  must  be  born  again,'and  sanctify  social  sympathies;  let  our  Congregational  friends  assert  all  human  liberties  underdivine  lordship — the  very  freaks  of  their  freedom  are  better  than  the  decay  and  decency  ofdespotism;  let  our  Baptist  brethren  make  thewilderness  a  pool  of  water;  let  our  evangelicalEpiscopalians — we  have  nothing  to  say  for  theother  sort — make  prayer  common  everywhere.They  are  all  needed  by  the  country,  needed  withus,  perhaps,  to  present  the  full-orbed  truth.  Letthem  all  render  their  parts  in  the  anthem  ofAmerican  praise  to  Jehovah.  When  they  all  singtheir  loudest,  many  places  are  still  silent;  and  inmany  their  voice  is  not  heard.  Be  our  aim  toswell  the  cry— not  to  silence  other  voices.  WeNINETEENTH  STREET  CHURCH     199have  a  share  in  their  graces  and  successes,  andthey  in  ours,  by  that  prerogative  of  saints,  'allthings  are  yours';  and  if  we  turn  our  union  totrue  and  spiritual  account,  they  ought  all  to  be  thebetter  for  it."  One  thing  seems  by  common  consent  agreedupon,  that  the  colleges  and  seminaries  of  theChurch  must  be  placed  upon  a  better  foundation.We  are  now  employing  the  first  men  in  thecountry,  on  incomes  shamefully  inadequate.  Itis  vain  to  expect  that  talent  and  culture  can  belong  retained  in  our  service  under  the  pressure  ofcares  that  belittle  and  vex;  and  that  vex  speciallythe  best  order  of  minds — minds  that  do  not  givea  thought  to  the  privations  of  poverty,  but  arechafed  by  its  meanness,  by  enforced  small  savings  and  compulsory  checks  upon  every  generousaspiration."  The  ministry  of  the  Word  has  similar  justground  of  complaint.  But  nine  out  of  ten  ministers  will  not  teach  their  people  duty  on  thismatter.  How  many  ministers  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  have  fairly  expounded  to  their  peoplei  Cor.  9?  The  press  must  speak  out  on  thissubject,  and  laymen  must  take  it  in  hand.  Thebetter-supported  ministers,  too,  who  can  speakon  this  point  without  the  suspicion  or  appearance200  THE  MINISTRY  INof  pleading  their  own  cause,  must  come  to  thehelp,  not  of  their  brethren,  but  of  the  churchthey  serve.  It  is  worth  considering  whether  effort  judiciously  and  successfully  laid  out  here,would  not  set  the  ministry  free  of  ill  conditionsthat  now  repel  some  who  could  educate  themselves,  and  so  swell  the  incomes  of  our  educational  institutions,  and  promote  other  desirableobjects.  Promptly  and  frankly  invited  to  thecolumns  of  The  Evangelist,  in  the  spirit  of  theunion,  it  would  be  a  great  joy  and  honor  to  thepresent  writer  if  he  could  make  any  contributionto  the  Church's  efficiency  in  these  directions."In  another  place  he  ventured  to  criticise  themethods  by  which  students  were  helped  into  theministry;  methods  which  he  could  not  but  feelundermined  their  self-respect,  and  jeopardizedtheir  standing  in  the  community.  Dr.  Hodgetook  him  very  sharply  to  task  for  his  opinions  onthis  subject,  but  they  remained  his  opinions  tothe  end.Very  early  in  his  ministry  good  ladies  askedhim  to  read  a  notice  from  the  pulpit  asking  forcast-off  clothing  for  the  theological  students  atPrinceton.  He  refused  to  do  it,  and  explainedhis  reasons.  To  him  it  seemed  unworthy  of  themanhood  and  womanhood  of  the  church  to  treatNINETEENTH  STREET  CHURCH    201those  who  were  to  be  leaders  and  teachers  as  objects  of  a  careless  charity  of  this  kind.  He  hadno  objection  to  the  church  training  her  ministry,but  her  methods  he  thought  altogether  wrong,and  traced  to  those  methods  much  of  the  restlessness  and  inefficiency  among  the  ministers  andchurches.  It  was  a  habit  of  his  to  watch  thenews  column  of  the  weekly  religious  press,  andwhen  he  saw  that  the  "Rev.  Mr.  A.  of  Boom-town  had  had  a  most  remarkable  ministry  full  ofsuccess,  and  had  just  added  thirty  souls  to  thecommunion  roll,"  he  said  he  expected  soon  eithera  note  asking  his  aid  in  a  change  for  Mr.  A.  or  aparagraph  stating  that  the  Rev.  Mr.  A.  contemplated  a  period  of  rest  after  his  labors.One  of  the  things  which  he  mourned  and  bewailed  in  common  with  Dr.  Adams  was  thecrowd  of  relatively  irresponsible  book  agents,insurance  solicitors,  and  unattached  ministerswho  filled  up  the  presbyteries,  and  destroyedoften  the  fraternal  confidence  which  alone  makesthe  presbytery  an  efficient  body.  It  remainedalso  his  opinion  to  the  end  that  Professors  ofTheology  should  be  admitted  as  active  elders  tothe  churches,  and  that  only  so  should  they  havefull  recognition  in  the  counsels  of  the  church.The  flitting  of  ministers  he  attributed  to  the  fault202  THE  MINISTRY  INof  both  churches  and  pastors.  Many  ministers,he  said,  reminded  him  of  the  little  sparrows  onthe  roof  which  keep  their  wings  twitching  all  thetime  ready  at  any  time  to  fly  on  the  slightest  impulse.My  father  thought  very  highly  of  Americanspeaking.  He  was  wont  to  contrast  Englishspeaking  with  the  American  type  of  easy  naturaladdress,  such  as  is  so  often  heard  on  the  platform  or  at  the  dinner-table.  He  did  not  think  sohighly  of  American  preaching,  highly  as  he  estimated  the  best  preachers.  Very  gently  hesought  to  intimate  as  much  in  his  early  ministry.After  the  reunion  he  wrote  an  article  that  wasmuch  quoted  on  "What  the  reunion  could  notdo."  The  italics  in  the  selection  from  it  are  hisown.  In  it  among  other  things  he  said:"There  are  many  desirable  objects  which  theUnited  Church  cannot  effect  by  any  direct  agency.She  cannot,  for  example,  make  all  her  ministersgood  preachers.  If  a  man  is  inclined  to  air  hisvocabulary  or  indulge  in  metaphysical  speculation,  in  his  sermons,  he  will  not  be  immediatelyaltered  by  being  in  the  United  Church.  Or  if  hecultivate  'simplicity'  until  it  becomes  childishness,  or  mistake  foolish  preaching  for  '  the  foolishness  of  preaching,'  the  union  will  not  instantlyNINETEENTH  STREET  CHURCH    203change  him.  This  is  a  matter  outside  the  powerof  the  General  Assemblies.  Presbyteries  indeedcan  use  greater  care  in  admitting  to  the  place  ofpreachers  those  who  are  destitute  of  the  powerto  preach;  but  as  regards  those  of  us  who  arelicensed,  our  preaching  must  depend  on  our  congregations  first,  and  secondly  on  ourselves.  Ifour  people  weary  and  harass  us  with  a  multiplicity  of  small  matters  they  could  better  managethemselves;  if  they  demand  that  we  swell  thepomp  of  every  social  gathering,  sit  through  everycommittee,  and  be  on  hand  generally  for  anything  and  everything,  then  we  shall  be  inferiorpreachers.  The  same  unhappy  end  can  bereached  by  forcing  a  portion  of  our  strengthaway  from  our  work,  as  for  example,  to  the  acquirement  of  further  means  of  living,  or  the  painful  and  anxious  economy  of  what  we  have."  Much  depends  on  ourselves.  If  we  livemainly  among  books  and  little  among  men;  ifwe  defer  the  severe  labor  of  composition  till  theend  of  the  week,  and  then  think  how  to  get  respectably  through  for  the  Sabbath,  intending  todo  better  next  week  ;  if  we  take  no  pains  toknow  the  points  at  which  we  and  the  messagewe  carry  can  come  into  contact  with  the  mindsof  our  hearers;  then  plainly  our  preaching  power204  THE  MINISTRY  INwill  be  small,  even  though  the  union  were  athousand  times  more  glorious  than  it  is.  But  ourpreaching  power  is  our  real  power,  and  there  isnot  one  among  us  that  will  not  own  that  hecould  have  made  much  more  of  it.  While  therefore  the  great  event  of  our  time  cannot  in  this  respect  improve  us,  it  were  surely  a  good  time  forour  people  and  ourselves  to  seek  that  improvement.  A  living  church  will  always  be  a  preaching  Church.  The  decay  of  the  pulpit  goes  handin  hand  with  the  decay  of  piety,  partly  as  cause,and  partly  as  effect.  We  shall  be  strong  whenmen  shall  feel  that  where  the  church  is  Presbyterian,  the  strong  presumption  is  that  there  willbe  in  it  thoroughly  good  preaching."As  a  preacher  his  own  success  in  New  Yorkwas  instantaneous.  In  the  letter  already  quoted(page  194)  to  his  friend  Dr.  Magee  he  dwellsupon  the  simplicity  which  adorned  his  preachingto  the  end.  His  first  sermon  was  preached  onNovember  the  jjd  on  the  text  Isa.  52  :  7,  "Howbeautiful  upon  the  mountains  are  the  feet  of  Himthat  bringeth  good  tidings,  etc."  The  sermondwelt  upon  the  poetical  character  of  the  passage,and  the  beauty  of  the  language,  then  expoundedthe  substance  of  the  message — a  message  ofpeace,  through  forgiveness  of  sin  and  loving  re-NINETEENTH  STREET  CHURCH    205lations  established  in  Christ  Jesus.  This  earlypreaching  was  characteristic  of  the  preaching  ofthe  lifetime.  Old  sermons  were  often  refused,and  my  father  not  only  did  not  despise  repreach-ing  of  sermons  but  thought  that  the  self-criticismof  the  process,  if  the  second  preparation  was  asconscientious  as  it  ought  to  be,  was  an  actualbenefit  both  to  the  preacher  and  his  people.Later  in  life  he  published  his  volume  on  "God'sword  through  preaching"  in  the  "  LymanBeecher  Lecture  "  course  before  the  Yale  Theological  Seminary,  in  which  he  set  forth  fully  hisviews  of  preaching  in  method  and  spirit.  Healso  wrote  at  one  time  an  interesting  little  autobiographical  sketch  of  his  pulpit  progress,  ofwhich  a  few  extracts  are  appended."Among  the  gifted  professors  of  the  Theological  Seminary,"  he  writes,  "of  which  I  enjoyedthe  advantages  were  two  men  of  conspicuousprominence  as  preachers.  Dr.  Henry  Cooke  andDr.  John  Edgar  were  unlike  in  style  and  manner,but  each  enjoyed  the  public  confidence  and  commanded  the  attention  of  the  community.  Theywere  not  only  instructors  in  principles  and  inmethods;  they  were  examples  and  inspirers.  Nominister  of  prominence  in  the  PresbyterianChurch  of  Ireland,  of  that  day,  read  his  manu-206  THE  MINISTRY  INscript  in  the  pulpit.  A  certain  proportion  of  itssix  hundred  pastors,  at  the  present  time  however,  read  carefully  prepared  discourses."It  was  the  rule  of  the  classes  for  the  student  toreceive  texts,  and  to  preach  from  them  before  theprofessor  and  the  class,  and  to  receive  such  criticism  from  the  professor  upon  arrangement,  matter,  and  manner,  as  he  felt  to  be  proper.  Thesermons  were  commonly  memorized  and  givenverbally  as  written.  Reading  was  not  the  orderof  those — to  the  preacher,  solemn  occasions."  We  were  not,  of  course,  taught  that  memorizing  the  language  was  to  be  our  enduring  method,but  that  careful  writing  contributed  to  order,clearness,  correctness  of  description,  and  definite-ness.  All  my  experience  since  my  student-daysconfirms  that  impression."My  ministry  began,  and  continued  for  threeyears,  in  somewhat  peculiar  conditions,  the  congregations  consisting  of  the  Protestant  Gentry,not  Presbyterians,  a  few  Presbyterians,  and  themajority  not  only  not  used  to  Protestant,  butmany  of  them  not  used  to  the  English  language.It  was  necessary  to  prepare  to  speak  in  such  away  as  to  interest  the  educated  and  at  the  sametime  to  be  intelligible  to  the  rest  of  the  hearers.It  was  not  uncommon  to  deliver  a  carefully  pre-NINETEENTH  STREET  CHURCH    207pared  sermon  in  the  forenoon,  to  go,  frequentlyon  foot,  seven  or  eight  miles  in  the  afternoon,and  repeat  it  to  a  corresponding  congregation,  inthe  evening.  The  experience  of  the  morningsometimes  led  to  modifications  in  the  evening.What  seemed  to  be  obscure  to  the  hearers  in  themorning  was  clarified  as  much  as  possible  in  thedelivery  to  the  evening  hearers."  It  appeared  to  be  my  duty,  at  length,  to  comefrom  the  '  West  of  Ireland  '  to  my  native  country,  and  take  charge  of  the  First  PresbyterianChurch,  in  succession  to  a  pastor  of  great  cultureand  of  high  character.  The  congregation  included  a  large  portion  of  the  educated  people  ofthe  city,  and  the  rest — one  half  the  congregation— consisted  of  comfortable  farmers  all  around  it,within  a  radius  of  two  to  three  miles.  The  samenecessity  existed  for  sermons  that  would  be  edifying  to  the  city  people  without  being  '  over  theheads'  of  the  rural  members.  The  writing  ofthe  sermons  went  on  as  before,  but  with  a  littleless  reproduction  in  speaking  of  the  language  aswritten.  The  topics  were  selected  early  in  theweek.  It  was  needful  to  go  into  the  rural  districts  for  week  evening  sermons,  in  schoolhousesand  in  farmers'  houses,  and  while  preparationwas  made  for  discourses  for  these  meetings,  it208  THE  MINISTRY  INwas  less  formal  than  for  the  Lord's  day,  consisting  of  'abstracts/  or  'notes,'  with  a  system  ofcontractions  both  of  sentences  and  of  words,  ofmy  own  invention."  It  was  then  common  to  arrange  topics  in  aseries,  so  that  preparation  in  reading  could  becarried  on  in  advance,  and  also  to  have  one  of  thetwo  services  expository — a  method  of  teachingwhich  many  people  need,  and  which  saves  thepastor  from  the  dreary  soliloquy,  'I  wonderwhat  I  should  preach  on  next  Sabbath.'  Theexpositions  did  not  require  as  much  writing,  butquite  as  much  study,  as  did  the  sermons;  and  itwas  found  to  be  a  help  to  regular  attendance  bythe  best  of  the  people,  when  they  naturally  said:'  I  would  like  to  hear  the  rest  of  what  he  has  tosay  on  that  line,'  of  subjects  or  of  an  Epistle,  ora  minor  prophet."After  half-a-dozen  happy  years  in  the  capitalof  my  native  county,  at  the  urgent  request  ofbrethren  to  whom  I  looked  up,  I  was  removedto  the  capital  of  my  native  land,  to  be  colleagueto  a  saintly  pastor  whose  name  I  write  downwith  affectionate  remembrance,  Rev.  Wm.  B.Kirkpatrick,  D.  D.  For  the  first  year  or  two  Ihad  only  to  preach  once  each  Sabbath  in  our  ownpulpit,  but  my  brethren  of  various  denominationsNINETEENTH  STREET  CHURCH    209were  very  good  to  me,  and  afforded  opportunitiesto  preach  when  I  was  not  needed  in  our  Mary'sAbbey."  It  is  proper  to  say — as  already  mentioned  thatevery  word  is  not  written  down,  nor  every  wordin  full.  One  learns  to  contract  sentences,  keeping  in  its  place  every  determining  word,  and  tocontrast  also,  familiar  words.  One  incidentaladvantage  of  this  it  may  be  allowable  to  mention.When  a  gentlemanly  reporter  asks  for  the  sermonthe  true  reply :  '  I  write  out,  but  with  a  systemof  abbreviation  a  printer  could  not  use,'  is  'asaving' — in  several  directions.'"  It  would  be  natural  to  say:  '  What  is  the  useof  writing  in  this  way?'  The  answer  I  givemight  not  be  pertinent  in  other  cases.  Thewriter  can  only  speak  for  himself.  One  hasoften  general  ideas,  indefinite  views  partly  fromthe  feeling,  partly  from  the  judgment.  To  putthem  down  distinctly  tends  to  remove  the  nebulous  element,  and  makes  them  communicable;for  how  can  an  audience  catch  an  idea  which  thespeaker  cannot  put  into  lucid  expression  ?Conciseness  is  thus  produced,  and  the  mind  ishelped  to  follow  the  natural  sequence  of  ideas.What  one  sees  under  heads  I,  II,  and  III,  withperhaps,  orderly  items  (i),  (2),  (3),  and  practical210  THE  MINISTRY  INapplications  (a),  (b),  (c),  will  usually  be  moreorderly,  easier  of  recollection,  and  more  intelligible  than  would  be  an  extemporaneous  addresshowever  much  thought  out.  There  is  moreover —the  writer  now  speaks  for  himself — a  certain  reliefto  the  mind  when  one  can  say  to  his  own  conscience:  'It  is  a  poor  sermon  for  such  a  grandtheme,  but  it  is  the  best  that  I  can  do.'  It  maynot  be  improper  to  add  that  I  have,  many  a  time,outlined  the  topics  for  thanksgiving,  confession,and  petition  in  prayer,  so  as  to  give  the  best  expression  I  could  to  what  the  people  should,  andwould,  join  in  presenting  before  the  Father'sthrone."The  building  at  Nineteenth  Street  was  soonpacked  at  each  service.  Camp-chairs  were  placeddown  each  aisle.  The  inconvenience  to  pew-holders  of  the  coming  of  strangers  into  theirpews  gave  rise  to  complaint;  and  promptly  sixof  the  most  influential,  and  one  or  two  of  themthe  oldest,  members  in  the  session  and  board  oftrustees  took  upon  themselves  the  task  of  seating  the  strangers,  and  made  in  many  ways  thechurch  one  of  the  pleasantest  to  visit.  WhenMr.  Robert  L.  Stewart  or  Mr.  Henry  Day  askedany  one  if  they  could  seat  a  stranger,  a  refusalwas  given  only  in  case  of  disagreeable  necessity.NINETEENTH  STREET  CHURCH    211The  services  being  in  the  morning  and  afternoon,  my  father  preached  almost  regularly  onSunday  evenings  in  some  other  church,  and  hisvoice  was  soon  familiar  in  almost  all  the  Evangelical  Churches  of  New  York  and  Brooklyn.Into  the  New  York  pastorate  was  brought  thesame  systematic  pastoral  work  that  had  markedhis  Dublin  and  Armagh  periods.  Day  after  dayhe  sought  out  the  members  of  his  flock,  high  andlow,  visiting  with  caretaking  system  family  afterfamily,  watching  over  those  employed  in  households  with  the  same  diligence  as  those  who  employed.  From  time  to  time  he  visited  the  business  section  of  the  city,  and  although  seldomsitting  down,  he  yet  visited  the  offices  of  thebusiness  and  professional  men.  He  liked  toknow,  he  said,  where  and  how  they  work.  Thesick  he  visited  regularly,  and  doctors  who  areoften  and,  sometimes  reasonably,  suspicious  ofministers'  visits  to  their  serious  cases,  have  toldthe  writer  that  they  made  exception  in  the  caseof  my  father,  whose  low  accents  and  readytact  and  short  ministrations  encouraged  andstrengthened  and  soothed,  where  less  skillful  orsympathetic  visitation  would  have  excited  anddone  harm.For  purely  social  engagements  he  had  no  time.212  THE  MINISTRY  INThe  number  of  houses  where  he  ever  dined  ina  formal  social  way  could  be  numbered  on  hisfingers.  He  felt  in  later  life,  that  he  perhaps  hadneglected  opportunities  along  this  line.  Yet  henever  saw  exactly  what  other  course,  underthe  circumstances,  he  could  have  pursued.  Thatthat  which  is  known  as  the  "  social  world  "  wasaltogether  out  of  his  range  and  knowledge  hefelt  with  some  degree  of  sadness.All  that  was  harmless  and  innocent  he  thoughtshould  be  in  contact  with  the  religious  life,yet  many  things  he  was  opposed  to,  whichChristian  feeling  he  deeply  respected  consideredinnocent.  Thus  he  never  thought  the  theatreanything  but  an  evil,  and  though  fond  of  music,even  if  in  an  untrained  way,  yet  he  never  wentwhere  he  thought  the  prejudices  of  any  wouldbe  offended,  and  when  abroad  he  always  resistedthe  inducements  often  held  out  to  him  by  friendsto  go  to  the  opera,  unwilling  to  do  abroad  whathe  would  not  do  at  home.Yet  he  had  abundant  charity  when  he  was  surethat  Christian  judgment  was  convinced  that  another  course  was  proper.  "I  am  not  a  policeman,"  he  once  said  to  one  who  playfully  confessed  a  fondness  for  the  theatre,  "  I  am  only  anadviser.  I  advise  you  not  to  go,  but  to  yourNINETEENTH  STREET  CHURCH    213Saviour  alone  you  stand  or  fall  in  such  matters;I  may  be  wrong."  And  once  writing  in  theChristian  Intelligencer  he  put  the  case  strongly,saying:"Let  us  not  as  Christian  ministers  undertake  to  pronounce  upon  amusements,  discriminating  which  is  good,  which  is  bad,  and  when  aninnocent  becomes  a  sinful  game.  For  one  thing,we  have  more  dignified  work  to  do  than  tomeasure  the  comparative  qualities  of  all  the  pastimes  of  the  people,  from  'fox  and  goose'  upward  or  downward.  For  another,  our  oraclewill  be  construed  in  ways  we  never  intended.We  approve,  for  example,  of  square  dances,  notof  round.  Well,  the  devil  will  soon  put  themischievous  elements  of  the  dance  we  condemninto  that  we  approve;  and  we  are  now  in  aworse  case  than  before,  for  the  evil  proceedswith  our  approval,  and  we  cannot  turn  dancing-masters  to  oppose  it,  nor  be  always  on  hand  topoint  it  out."For  yet  another  thing,  this  plan  minimisesChristian  people.  'Our  minister  allows  so  andso;'  'Our  pastor  disapproves  of  so  and  so.'What!  have  you  no  judgment,  no  conscience,  noBible  ?  or  are  they  packed  away  like  children'sknives,  lest  they  should  cut  their  innocent  fingers,2i4  THE  MINISTRY  INwhile  a  clerical  mamma,  or  a  Rev.  '  Father'  doesall  the  serious  cutting  ?  Let  me  be  a  preacher,  ateacher,  a  writer,  if  1  can;  but  let  me  never  become  that  compound  of  vanity,  ambition,  love  ofpower,  misguided  zeal  and  distorted  religion,  '  aspiritual  director.'  We  are  helpers  of  the  people's  faith.  Saintliness  as  well  as  sex  forbids  ourbeing  degraded  into  duennas."Many  thought  on  account  of  his  firm  views  onsuch  subjects  that  they  had  to  be  hypocrites  tohim.  But  that  was  not  the  case.  Some  of  hisdearest  friends  differed  from  him  and  he  hadonly  to  be  sure  that  they  were  acting  conscientiously,  and  for  him  the  matter  was  settled.He  might  think  them  mistaken,  but  he  left  thefinal  decision  to  themselves.For  his  judgment  in  even  business  matters  menversed  in  such  things  had  a  profound  respect.As  he  went  in  and  out  as  a  pastor  his  worth  as  afriend  and  helpful  adviser  was  recognized.  Hiscorrespondence  up  to  the  day  of  his  death  revealsthe  thousand  avenues  of  his  influence  as  hiscounsel  was  sought  for  far  and  wide.  In  hispastoral  work  he  sought  to  bring  forward  thespiritual  interests  he  had  at  heart.  Where  it  waspossible  and  it  could  be  tactfully  done  he  soughtto  have  prayer  with  those  whom  he  visited.  OfNINETEENTH  STREET  CHURCH    215course  in  a  great  city  this  was  not  always  possible.  But  sooner  or  later  on  occasion  of  troubleor  loss  or  difficulty  he  came  as  the  bearer  of  amessage  into  nearly  every  family  of  his  congregation.  And  even  after  the  first  shock  had  laidthe  foundation  for  the  trouble  that  ended  his  life,he  toiled  patiently  up  high  flights  of  stairs,  often,in  vain,  seeking  those  who  sometimes  had  butthe  barest  claims  upon  his  ministry.  A  physician  who  knew  him  only  by  sight  was  deeplymoved  in  the  spring  of  1898  by  seeing  him  leaning  heavily  and  breathlessly  on  the  balustradetoiling  up  three  flights  of  stairs  he  should  neverhave  attempted  to  climb,  as  he  sought  out  someone  to  whom  he  was  bringing  his  message  ofpeace  and  hope.IX.

THEOLOGY.NEW  YORK  in  the  years  between  1867  and1870  was  in  many  respects  a  very  differentcity  from  the  Greater  New  York  of  to-day.  Noris  the  new  city  altogether  an  improvement.  Thewhole  scale  of  living  was  simpler.  The  extremesof  poverty  only  began  to  be  apparent  after  1873,and  the  city  itself,  if  wholly  lacking  in  architectural  attractiveness,  had  yet  an  air  of  comfortablesufficiency  written  on  even  its  byways.  Eventhe  gaudy  Bowery,  in  those  days  the  climax  ofrough  looseness  of  life,  was  neither  so  squalidnor  so  repulsive  as  are  similar  situations  in  thegreater  city.  At  the  same  time  there  was  written  then  on  the  face  of  New  York  the  fact  that  theperiod  was  one  of  transition.  The  "old  inhabitants''  whose  fishing  stories  included  CanalStreet    in    their  hunting-grounds,   felt  that  the219220    THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGmovement  up-town  was  not  going  to  stop  atTwenty-third  Street.  The  insufficiency  of  thebuilding  at  Nineteenth  Street  and  Fifth  Avenue  tocontain  the  congregation  was  made  clear  fromthe  very  first.  In  the  beginning  it  was  felt  thatthe  increase  might  perhaps  be  temporary,  butthe  pastoral  work  that  followed  up  the  preachingmade  the  pressure  on  the  pews  only  greater  fromweek  to  week.  Moreover  the  visiting  was  moreand  more  "  up-town,"  and  the  drift  of  the  population  was  manifest.  At  the  same  time  CentralPark  seemed  to  supply  a  natural  barrier,  andwhen  at  last  the  demand  for  more  room  becameimperative,  many  asked  themselves,  where  canwe  go  and  be  safe  for  years  to  come  ?  The  answer  to  that  question  was  not  easy  to  give,  andcaused  delay  for  some  time.  Many,  and  thosethoughtful  men,  wanted  simply  to  stay  and  buildon  the  old  site  a  larger  church.  Others  thoughtthat  the  neighborhood  of  Forty-first  Street  wasas  far  up  as  the  congregation  could  with  safetygo.  At  first  a  small  number,  but  a  graduatelyincreasing  one,  decided  that  if  the  church  movedit  should  move  ahead  of  the  centre  of  presentpopulation,  and  that  by  going  near  to  the  CentralPark  a  fair  permanency  might  be  obtained.This  view  my  father  shared.  He  felt  howeverAND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE    221that  under  all  the  circumstances  the  congregationmust  take  the  responsibility  of  any  change.Already  in  July  of  the  year  1868  there  had  cometo  the  old  Nineteenth  Street  Church  the  enterprising  owner  of  the  family  weekly  paper  whichhad  then  the  widest  circulation  of  any  familypaper  in  America,  if  not  in  the  world.  Mr.  Robert  Bonner  was  of  Scotch-Irish  blood,  and  a  manof  prodigious  energy  and  wonderful  discernmentand  knowledge  of  men  and  things.  He  was  atonce  attracted  to  my  father  and  the  two  men,  inmany  ways  utterly  unlike,  became  fast  and  lifelong  friends.  He  at  once  flung  himself  quietlybut  most  efficiently  into  the  affairs  of  the  church.He  was  known  and  utterly  trusted  by  the  groupof  men,  who  one  by  one  were  taken  away  fromthe  counsels  of  the  church  by  death,  until  at  lasthe  remained  well-nigh  the  only  survivor  at  thetime  of  my  father's  own  decease.  He  was  knownall  over  the  world  as  the  owner  of  "Dexter  "  thefamous  trotter  whose  record  has  been  beaten,  butwhose  fame  has  never  been  surpassed.  He  however  had  tried  to  explain  to  my  father  in  a  playfulletter  that  he  never  trotted  his  horses  for  money,and  never  had  them  raced.  Far-seeing  and  resolute  Mr.  Bonner  had  made  up  his  mind  very  earlyjust  where  the  church  should  be  built,  and  in222     THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGquiet  talks  with  those  who  had  been  longer  inthe  church  he  succeeded  in  getting  a  number  toshare  his  views.  He  was  moreover  of  the  opinion  advanced  by  Mr.  R.  L.  Stuart,  at  that  timethe  most  influential  officer  in  the  church,  thatwhen  the  new  building  was  undertaken  it  shouldbe  both  in  extent  and  character  worthy  of  Pres-byterianism  in  the  metropolitan  city  of  the  East.By  1872  the  plans  were  well  under  way,  and  ina  congregational  meeting  the  resolution  hadalready  been  carried,  with  practical  unanimity  togo  up-town.  Real  estate  was  at  that  time  countedhigh,  and  the  price  of  the  lots  seemed  to  manyenormous,  although  they  could  not  now  bebought,  probably,  for  anything  like  the  sum  thenpaid.  The  plans  for  the  building  that  now  standson  the  corner  of  Fifth  Avenue  and  Fifty-fifthStreet  were  approved  and  bonds  were  issued  tosecure  the  necessary  funds.  The  correspondenceof  the  years  1872  to  1877  are  filled  with  the  plansand  pains  attendant  upon  so  large  an  enterprise.To  "own  a  pew"  meant  in  the  Old  Worldtradition  family  possession  with  the  payment  ofa  yearly  tithe.  This  plan  had  been  adoptedwith  reference  to  the  Nineteenth  Street  building,hence  when  the  change  was  contemplated  the"owners"  of  pews,  in  distinction  from  thoseAND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE    223simply  renting  them  yearly  from  the  trustees,  inthe  old  building  had  already  claims  for  "ownership  "  in  the  pews  of  the  new  structure.  In  someways  this  was  felt  to  be  unfortunate  by  several,yet  on  the  other  hand  the  plans  for  a  changewere  fostered  by  those  who  were  bound  by  theold  tradition,  and  who  felt  they  had  a  life  interest  in  the  material  side  of  the  church  organization.The  building  committee  was  a  strong  body  ofable  men  ;  the  plans  were  made  on  a  liberal  scale,and  the  building  was  started.  In  spite  of  the  factthat  the  panic  of  1873  found  many  of  the  congregation  financially  imperilled,  and  notwithstandingthe  losses  all  suffered  in  the  falling  prices,  thebuilding  proceeded  steadily  and  was  occupied  in1875.By  this  time  my  father  had  also  removedhis  residence  to  No.  3  West  Fifty-sixth  Street,Which  house  became  the  parsonage  from  thattime  until  later  lots  were  bought  next  thechurch,  in  part  to  protect  its  light  and  appearance,and  on  those  lots  a  parsonage  was  then  built.The  debt,  however,  hanging  over  the  church  wasa  burden  on  my  father's  heart.  Many  were  inclined  to  let  "  another  generation"  bear  some  ofthe  burdens.  The  minister  felt  the  infelicity  of224    THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGsuch  a  course.  He  feared  a  possible  vacancy  inthe  pastoral  office,  and  dreaded  the  ill-effects  of  alarge  debt  on  other  churches.  He  found  also  thatthe  benevolences  of  the  church  might  suffer.Hence  he  strained  his  influence  with  the  congregation  to  the  utmost,  and  having  the  heartysupport  of  Mr.  Robert  Bonner,  whose  total  giftsfar  exceeded  those  of  any  other  single  individual,the  debt  was  paid  in  the  spring  of  1877.  Thisclosing  of  the  debt  account  was  felt  to  begin  anew  era  of  activity.  From  this  on  the  churchbecame  the  centre  of  untold  streams  of  influence,and  the  incessant  labors  of  the  pastor  seemed  tohave  no  end  and  no  limit.No  sketch  of  my  father's  life  would  be  according  to  his  mind  and  heart  without  some  record  ofthat  group  of  men  who  shared  his  earliest  ministryin  New  York,  and  who  remained  his  warm  and  enthusiastic  supporters  until  death  took  them  one  byone  from  each  other.  The  two  brothers  Mr.  R.  L.and  Alexander  Stuart  were  among  the  first  towelcome  the  young  Irish  delegate  in  1867,  andbecame  warm  advocates  of  the  policy  of  callinghim  to  America.  The  wealth  at  their  disposalthey  gave  freely  and  thoughtfully.  They  bothhad  peculiarities,  such  as  are  often  found  in  menof  those  earlier  days,  but  they  remained  to  theAND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE     225end  of  their  lives  faithful  and  wise  friends  of  myfather.  To  Mr.  Henry  Day  he  was  also  devotedly  attached;  like  Mr.  De  Forest,  Mr.  HenryDay  stood  openly  upon  a  theological  groundbroader  than  was  the  tradition  of  the  church.But  for  such  differences  my  father  had  but  littleinterest;  he  saw  in  the  men  the  Christ-life,  andhonored  it  under  other  theological  terms,  whileholding  fast  and  deeming  of  importance  hisown  theological  forms.  Very  early  Mr.  WilliamWalker  was  taken  from  the  side  of  his  pastor,and  he  was  sorely  missed.  He  was  a  peculiarlyoutspoken  man,  although  gentle  almost  to  weakness,  and  with  him  my  father  had  profoundspiritual  sympathies.  They  shared  some  hopesand  fears  for  the  church  together,  about  whichmy  father  seldom  spoke  to  any  other  of  his  officers.  Upon  Mr.  William  Sloane  also  my  fatherleaned  for  many  things.  He  honored  Mr.  Sloane'sfaithful  personal  services.  As  the  treasurer  ofthe  church  he  did  with  his  own  hand  in  themidst  of  an  exceedingly  busy  life,  work  he  refused  to  entrust  to  any  clerk,  as  he  felt  it  was  ofa  highly  confidential  nature.  Mr.  William  Skid-more  too  was  one  who  stood  closely  to  the  interests  of  the  church,  and  was  near  my  father  inall  counsels.  There  were  others,  some  of  his226     THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGearly  advisers  and  friends  God  has  spared  in  Hisgoodness,  to  this  day,  and  others  like  Mr.  H.  M.Alexander  survived  him  by  only  a  little  while.The  entrance  into  the  new  building  was  followed  by  an  immediate  increase  in  the  work  entailed  upon  the  pastor.  The  visiting  becameeven  more  difficult  as  it  stretched  from  Washington  Square  far  up-town  past  the  Central  Park.To  make  the  visitation  more  efficient  the  planwas  adopted,  of  reading  from  the  pulpit  thestreets  in  which  the  pastor  expected  to  visit  during  the  week.  It  was  one  of  the  discouragements  of  his  later  ministry  that  the  pastoralvisitation  did  not  seem  to  him  as  effective  or  asmuch  sought  after  as  before  the  great  scatteringof  the  city,  and  the  changes  that  have  taken  placein  the  mode  of  living  of  the  people.  Thesechanges  were  going  on  very  rapidly.  The  steadyquiet  life  that  was  characteristic  of  the  so  manyAmerican  homes  in  the  earlier  period  exists,  nodoubt,  to-day,  but  the  showy  luxurious  life  of  agreat  wasteful  cosmopolitan  city  is  what  is  onthe  surface;  is  seen  daily,  and  affects  sooner  orlater  all  classes.It  was  to  my  father,  as  probably  to  manyanother  thoughtful  city  minister,  a  source  ofanxiety  that  the  home  training  no  longer  seemedAND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE     227to  him  to  emphasize  properly  the  religious  element.  This  was  undoubtedly  an  increasing  anxiety  as  the  congregation  grew  larger  and  largerand  less  and  less  homogeneous.The  expense  of  the  church  was,  of  course,  amatter  of  remark  and  of  some  criticism.  Thiscriticism  my  father  always  considered  thoughtless  and  short-sighted.  By  nature  he  was  interested  in  and  attached  to  institutions.  He  saw  inthe  institutional  life  of  the  Presbyterian  church  atremendous  force.  That  force  could  only  be  felt,he  realized,  in  a  great  and  growing  city  by  aninstitutional  life  worthy  in  external  character  ofthe  life  it  represented.  It  was  not  needless  display,  but  a  harmony  between  the  external  andthe  inner  life  which  attracted  him  in  the  plans  fora  permanent  building  of  larger  proportions  thanthe  ordinary  church  life  demands.  The  buildingrepresented  to  him  the  place  he  felt  Presbyterian-ism  should  have  in  the  forming  of  the  city  life,and  in  the  moulding  of  future  character.  Intothe  new  building  he  built  his  own  life  and  heart,not  for  his  own  sake,  but  for  the  sake  of  thatwhich  was  dearer  to  him  than  life.The  sale  of  the  pews  took  place  on  a  Mondaynight  and  on  Tuesday  the  following  characteristicnote  from  Mr.  Bonner  announced  the  result.228     THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGTuesday  morning,  1875.DEAR  DR.  HALL  :Five  hundred  and  twenty  thousand  dollars  for  one  hundred  and  ninety-one  pews  !  Nothing  like  it  was  ever  known.At  least,  so  they  all  say.  It  was  too  late  last  night,  when  weascertained  the  result,  or  John  A.,  and  R.  B.,  would  have  beenover  at  your  house  to  congratulate  you.  As  Napoleon  said,"  Much  has  been  done,  but  much  yet  remains  to  do."In  Dr.  James  W.  Alexander's  "  Familiar  Letters  "  he  hasseveral  passages  about  the  Nineteenth  Street  church  buildingwhen  it  was  new  which  I  think  will  interest  you.  I  presumeyou  have  his  "  Letters  "  ;  but  I  have  marked  several  passagesin  my  volume,  so  that  you  can  see  them  at  a  glance.  Seepages  178,  179,  180,  181,  182  and  183.We  are  all  delighted  with  the  result.  The  most  sanguine  ofus  did  not  expect  over  $30,000  in  premiums,  and  yet  we  hadover  $74,000  for  the  privilege  of  taking  pews  at  those  highprices  !  Ever  yours,ROBERT  BONNER.The  building  was  largely  paid  for  by  the  energy  of  a  few.  In  a  note,  intended  to  restrain  ina  playful  way  any  tendency  to  excessive  exultation,  Mr.  Bonner  sent  later  the  following  calculations  with  regard  to  the  sources  of  the  income:May  8th,  1877.MY  DEAR  DR.  HALL  :Inasmuch  as  you  have  asked  me,  I  will  answer  franklythat  I  do  not  think  you  have  any  particular  reason  for  "  bragging  "  much  of  the  work  that  your  "  people  "  have  done  in  paying  off  the  debt.Let  us  look  at  the  facts  :  Figures  in  this  case  will  not  lie.Before  we  entered  the  new  church,  we  raised  exactly  $180,-222.09  ;  an(i  now  we  have  had  subscribed,  including  collection,$148,174.00, — making  from  all  sources  a  total  of  $328,996.09AND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE     229that  has  been  given  to  the  church.  This,  of  course,  has  noreference  to  receipts  from  sales  of  pews;  but  it  is  «//that  hasever  been  given.  Now,  of  this  entire  sum  I  find  that  WilliamSloan  has  given  #50,000  ;  R.  L.  and  A.  Stuart  #65,000  ;  R.  B.#131,000 — making  from  three  parties  alone,  #246,000.  If  youtake  #246,000  from  #328,996.09,  you  have  only  #82,996.09left ; — but  even  of  this  sum  the  pastor  and  his  family  contributed#3,427.88  ;  so  that  all  which  your  "  people  "  (three  parties  onlyexcepted)  have  ever  given  under  any  and  all  circumstances,  forthe  million-dollar  church,  amounts  to  just  #79,568.21.  Notmuch  in  my  judgment,  (which  you  ask),  to  "  brag"  of.The  congregations  at  once  filled  the  building.At  first  it  was  thought  that  after  a  little  while  thecongregations  would  fall  off — curiosity  havingbeen  satisfied.  This  was  not  the  case.  Thefaithful  pastoral  work  that  followed  up  thepreaching  secured  ever  increasing  strength  to  thepermanent  worshippers,  and  Sunday  after  Sunday  throughout  the  winter  months  great  audiences  listened  to  the  simple  straightforwardpreaching  that  remained  substantially  the  samein  message  and  character  from  the  beginning  tothe  end.Here  may  be  the  place  to  speak  of  the  outsidework  that  fell  to  the  lot  of  the  minister  of  solarge  a  church.  It  was  often  an  amazement  tothose  who  had  correspondence  with  him,  howthe  pastor  of  the  Fifth  Avenue  church  could  dohis  work  without  a  secretary.  The  extent  of  the230     THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGcorrespondence  was  enormous.  Every  activityin  which  he  had  an  interest  brought  with  it  innumerable  notes,  requests,  demands  of  one  sortor  another.  From  the  first  all  letters  were  answered  by  himself,  and  with  the  exception  ofthree  winters,  when  the  writer  cared  for  his  correspondence  in  part,  and  two  winters  when  hehad  outside  help  in  arranging  all  his  papers,  hecared  for  all  his  writing  with  his  own  pen.  Tothe  last  he  wrote  the  same  firm,  rapid,  legiblehandwriting  which  made  his  little  "nightschool"  on  the  old  farm  a  much  sought  circle.His  interest  in  education  was  intelligent  andkeen.  Perhaps  his  experience  from  the  days  ofthat  boyish  experiment  in  some  degree  accountsfor  this  interest.  Very  early  he  began  to  raisehis  voice  in  favor  of  more  thorough  education  inthe  United  States.  He  defended  the  publicschool  system  of  New  York  in  days  when  theundue  preponderance  of  Irish  Roman  Catholicsof  an  earnest  but  ignorant  type  attacked  it  withsome  show  of  success.  This  was  the  same  battle  for  "Godless"  education  as  even  good  Protestants  called  it,  which  he  had  fought  in  Ireland.When  the  reunion  of  the  Old  and  New  SchoolAssemblies  took  place  he  was  given  a  representative  responsibility  in  the  Board  of  Directors  ofAND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE    231Union  Theological  Seminary.  He  was  also  atrustee  of  Princeton  College,  and  had  a  good  dealto  do  with  obtaining  Dr.  McCosh  as  president  ofthat  institution.  In  Princeton  Seminary  he  wasalso  deeply  interested,  and  rejoiced  at  the  warmsupport  given  that  school  of  learning  by  Mr.  andMrs.  Stuart.  After  Dr.  Hodge  had  forgiven  himfor  his  heresies  on  the  subject  of  eleemosynaryeducation,  the  affinity  in  theology  drew  the  twomen  together,  and  the  warm  and  kindly  temperof  Dr.  Hodge  was  always  highly  praised  whenever  he  spoke  on  the  subject.Along  another  line  quite  outside  the  individualChurch  much  strength  and  time  was  given  fromthe  first  by  the  newcomer  to  American  shores.He  found  the  Sunday-school  instruction  beyondall  description  bad.  It  is  weak  and  superficialenough  now,  but  then  it  was  far  worse.  TheInternational  Sunday-school  Series  had  his  warmest  support  and  advocacy.  In  fact  the  International  character  was  largely  due  to  his  influenceand  exertions.  From  the  beginning  he  sat  withthe  committee  on  the  lessons,  and  week  afterweek  wrote  expositions  of  those  lessons  for  theSunday-school  World,  the  organ  of  the  American  Sunday-school  Union.  In  later  life  he  wentoff  the  committee  and  felt  in  some  degree  that232     THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGthe  International  Lessons  had  served  their  purpose.  He  was  loyal  to  the  General  Assembly'sdecision  to  establish  a  Sunday-school  Board,  atthe  same  time  he  had  given  so  much  time  andstrength  to  the  Interdenominational  Sunday-school  work  that  to  the  end  this  aspect  had  hismost  hearty  sympathy.  One  whole  summer  hedevoted  to  a  tour  on  behalf  of  the  work  ofthe  Sunday-school  Union,  and  visited  all  thelarger  places  of  Iowa,  Kansas,  Illinois  and  on  intoMichigan  working  with  Mr.  Ensign,  and  holding  night  after  night  great  meetings  the  effectsof  which  are  yet  felt  in  the  western  work.One  of  the  impressions  he  records  on  that  tripwas  of  a  lack  of  really  highly  cultured  youngwomen  as  teachers,  a  lack  more  felt  then  perhapsthan  now,  and  he  took  a  warm  interest  in  the  workof  the  colleges  for  women.  He  had  prejudicesagainst  coeducaton,  even  where  he  saw  it  wasinevitable,  but  as  trustee  for  Wellesley  and  aspreacher  to  other  such  institutions  he  did  whathe  could  to  show  his  sense  of  the  need  of  high-class  intellectual  work  for  women.Much  against  the  advice  of  some  very  near  tohim,  he  refused  to  acquiesce  in  the  hopelessnesswith  which  some  had  come  to  regard  the  NewYork  University.  His  friend  Dr.  Howard  CrosbyAND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE    233had  without  any  compensation,  and  with  muchenergy  and  tact  conducted  the  affairs  of  the  University  as  chancellor.  He  at  last  became,  myfather  thought,  unnecessarily  discouraged,  andthe  institution  was  in  actual  danger.  With  thenew  church  on  his  hands  and  all  the  other  dutiesto  do,  it  seemed  quite  impossible  for  him  to  assume  a  new  responsibility.  But  he  did.  Withthe  title  of  chancellor  pro  tern,  he  at  once  tookhold,  and  raised  enough  to  insure  the  existenceof  the  institution.  Then  he  summoned  to  his  aidDr.  MacCracken,  who  became  vice-chancellor,and  as  soon  as  the  reins  were  in  his  hands  relieved  my  father  of  responsibility  along  thoselines.  This  was  in  the  year  1881,  and  he  onlyretired  from  the  position  in  1891,  when  the  obvious  success  of  the  acting  chancellor,  Dr.  MacCracken  made  him  no  longer  necessary  to  theinstitution's  success.  It  was  with  profound  conviction  that  such  an  institution  of  learning  wasneeded,  even  while  recognizing  the  wide  scopeof  Columbia  University,  that  the  work  was  done.He  was  firmly  persuaded  that  under  existingconditions  no  one  place  of  learning  would  represent  all  the  aspirations  for  higher  education  foundin  New  York.  He  considered  it  wholesome  forboth  institutions  that  they  should  prosper  along234    THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGtheir  own  lines.  In  his  judgment  there  was  notonly  room  and  place  for  both,  but  a  very  realneed  for  both.  How,  he  used  to  ask,  would  anyBoard  of  Trustees  succeed  in  representing  all  theconflicting  interests  and  various  educational  idealsfound  in  our  heterogeneous  population  ?  Thewisdom  of  his  action  has  been  abundantly  justified  by  the  success  of  the  institution.As  the  education  struggle  in  Ireland  fitted  himin  some  degree  for  facing  the  educational  problems  of  America,  so  also  the  experience  in  themissions  of  Connaught  made  him  ever  a  warmsupporter  of  home  missions  in  his  adoptedcountry.  After  the  reconstruction  of  the  Church'swork  in  connection  with  the  reunion  he  becameconnected  officially  with  the  Home  Board,  andserved  its  interests  faithfully  until  his  illness  in1898  when  he  desired  to  lay  down  his  office  ofPresident  of  the  Board.  To  Assembly  afterAssembly  he  addressed  stirring  appeals  for  thecause  he  had  ever  on  his  heart.  He  enlisted  awide  public  sympathy  on  behalf  of  the  West,  andhis  personal  knowledge  of  the  country  gave  hisappeals  great  force.  In  his  choice  of  colaborershis  fault  was  an  unbounded  but,  alas,  not  alwayswell-founded  faith  that  all  men  had  his  enthusiasm  and  his  capacity  and  willingness  to  work.AND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE     235It  was  at  times  quite  pathetic  to  see  how  woundedand  hurt  he  was  by  the  carelessness,  blundersand  incompetency  of  those  whom  he  had  trustedas  good  men  with  sincere  professions.It  was  in  good  faith  that  he  assumed  the  presidency  of  the  Board  of  Home  Missions  of  the  reunited  church.  He  felt  himself  to  be  a  representative  of  both  wings,  and  he  always  tried  toinsist  on  fairness  and  justice  in  the  theologicaldisputes  some  tried  to  introduce  into  its  workings.  Indignantly  he  repelled  the  suggestion  ofmaking  the  Home  Board  representative  of  oneshade  of  thought  in  the  church.  Many  whoheard  his  speech,  made  by  courtesy  at  the  Assembly,  of  which  he  was  not  a  member,  in  defense  of  the  policy  he  stood  for  in  Pittsburg  in1895,  bitterly  resented  it,  but  he  carried  the  Assembly  with  him,  and  saved  the  good  faith  andthe  credit  of  the  Board  of  Home  Missions.  Atthat  Assembly  it  had  been  proposed  to  practicallymake  the  Home  Board  the  organ  of  a  particularshade  of  theological  opinion.  The  results  of  anysuch  action  would  have  been  disastrous,  yet  undoubtedly  the  proposal  would  have  been  carried,had  not  my  father  as  the  president  of  the  Board,obtained  the  floor  and  in  a  brief  speech  of  greatpower  completely  turned  the  tide.236     THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGOnly  now  and  then  were  the  really  remarkablepowers  of  persuasion  and  of  debate,  possessedby  my  father,  seen  to  their  best  advantage.  Heboth  distrusted  Mr.  Henry  Ward  Beecher's  theology  and  disliked,  what  he  considered,  Beecher'ssuperficial  treatment  of  the  older  thought.  Hehad  occasion,  however,  in  his  earlier  life  in  NewYork  to  indirectly  have  a  good  deal  of  intercoursewith  Mr.  Beecher,  through  Mr.  Robert  Bonner,who  was  a  warm  friend  of  Mr.  Beecher's,  andcontinued  so,  until  he  thought  Mr.  Beecher  misused  his  confidence  when  a  certain  coldness  camebetween  the  two  men.  Mr.  Beecher  often  expressed  a  good  deal  of  admiration  for  the  "  youngIrishman  with  the  golden  mouth,"  as  he  once  calledhim,  and  got  several  articles  for  his  paper  from  hispen.  They  also  met  occasionally  on  the  platform,and  at  one  such  meeting  Mr.  Beecher  took  occasionto  speak  slightingly  of  Calvin.  This  gave  an  occasion  for  my  father. to  defend  in  courteous,  butvigorous  language  what  he  considered  Mr.Beecher  had  too  lightly  defamed.  My  father  wasat  that  time  relatively  unknown,  but  many  whowere  present,  have  since  told  the  writer  that  theynever  heard  a  more  able  and  impressive  answer,and  never  saw  a  great  audience,  at  the  beginninghostile,  so  completely  carried  off  by  enthusiasmAND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE    237for  that  at  which  a  few  minutes  before  theywere  laughing  and  jesting  under  the  influence  ofMr.  Beecher's  wonderful  powers  of  banter  andattack.Another  line  of  work  strongly  attracted  myfather.  He  felt  the  need  of  maintaining  andstrengthening  the  institutional  church  life  ofProtestantism  in  the  city.  Both  in  the  work  ofchurch  extension  and  in  city  missions  was  he  engaged  faithfully  and  actively  for  many  years.He  was,  perhaps,  inclined  to  underestimate  thenecessity  of  a  variety  in  the  church  work  amongthe  more  floating  populations,  and  to  considerextravagant  what  other  men's  experience  taughtthem  to  consider  necessary  expense.  Yet  henever  for  one  moment  doubted  that  as  the  citywas  so  would  the  country  be  soon.  Like  Paulhe  felt  that  the  city  must  be  captured  and  held  ifthe  cause  of  Christ  and  righteousness  were  totriumph.  This  faith  in  institutional  life  showeditself  in  his  eagerness  to  advance  church  erectionover  the  land.  When  the  General  Assemblypassed  the  very  wise  rule  that  a  minister  shouldhave  a  place  on  only  one  board,  against  his  judgment,  and  at  the  request  of  the  Board  of  ChurchErection  my  father  was  made  a  special  exception,and  he  remained  on  both  boards  as  long  as  he238     THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGthought  he  could  be  useful.  His  special  eagerness  being  to  provide  parsonages  as  far  as  possible  in  connection  with  the  weaker  churches.His  arguments  were  that  such  a  "manse"  wasgenerally  a  good  investment;  gave  the  ministeran  official  residence  that  was  there  beyond  criticism  as  "too  shabby  or  too  luxurious";  was  acertain  part  of  the  salary  that  could  not  "getbehindhand";  and  was  to  the  community  acertain  guarantee  of  permanence  in  the  churchlife.The  literary  ambitions  of  my  father  werelimited  to  immediate  influence  upon  his  owngeneration.  From  his  earliest  public  life  in  Con-naught  he  had  made  use  of  the  public  press.Early  he  valued  highly  the  weekly  press,  and  rejoiced  in  every  opportunity  of  addressing  thosewho  might  in  no  other  way  come  under  his  influence.  The  enormous  amount  of  literary  workhe  accomplished  in  the  midst  of  his  other  laborsseems  well-nigh  incredible.  From  1869  to  about1887,  he  must  have  averaged  weekly  an  amount  ofwriting  equal  to  at  least  three  columns  of  the  ordinary  daily  paper.  For  the  New  York  Ledger  hewrote  regularly  and  successfully,  and  in  large  degree  considered  it  a  part  of  his  best  work.  Hisarticles  had  always  a  moral  and  religious  aim,AND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE     239and  yet  they  were  read  by  thousands  whose  liveshe  could  in  no  other  way  touch.  Dr.  TheodoreD.  Cuyler  has  often  emphasized  the  "pen  andthe  weekly  press,"  and  along  the  same  lines  myfather  steadily  worked.  With  the  exception  ofa  little  volume  of  "  Papers  for  Home  Reading  "published  by  Dodd  and  Mead  he  refused  to  evenattempt  to  give  a  permanent  form  to  these  writings.  He  said  of  them  as  of  sermons  that  thethought  of  writing  for  posterity  would  detractfrom  their  power  for  the  present.  All  his  literary  work  sprang  thus  from  his  sense  of  immediate  need.  Early  he  published  a  volume  of"  Family  Prayers  "  because  he  found  many  coming  over  to  evangelical  Protestantism  who  knewnot  how  to  pray,  save  as  they  had  some  printedguidance.  He  followed  Mr.  Henry  WardBeecher  in  the  Yale  Lecture  Course  on  Preaching,with  a  series  of  simple,  but  direct  lectures  on"  God's  Word  through  Preaching"  (Dodd,  Meadand  Co.,  New  York).  For  the  American  Sunday-school  Union  he  once  wrote  a  volume  on  "  TheChristian  Home"  1883,  and  one  of  the  tasks  inwhich  he  took  great  delight  towards  the  close  ofhis  life  was  a  volume  of  daily  texts  with  comments  called  "Light  Upon  My  Path"  publishedby  Brentano.  He  had  no  ambition  to  shine  either240     THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGas  a  profound  thinker,  or  as  a  literary  genius.Yet  all  that  he  wrote  is  marked  by  the  utmostrefinement  of  feeling  for  style  and  balance  ofsentence.  And  all  his  writings  breathe  the  clear,simple  manly  common  sense,  that  made  him  theready  helper  of  so  many  thousands.He  never  overestimated  his  own  powers,  indeed  he  rather  underestimated  them,  and  whatever  he  did  he  did  with  a  certain  force  and  directness  peculiarly  his  own.  He  actually  objectedto  publishing  or  printing  his  sermons  and  addresses,  and  in  the  few  cases  in  which  this  wasdone  he  generally  appended  an  apology.  Yetnaturally  many  such  sermons  and  addressesfound  their  way  into  print.  Some  he  revisedhimself,  but  generally  all  he  attempted  was  tocorrect  with  his  own  pen  any  slips  and  obscurities.In  all  his  literary  work,  as  in  his  preachingwhat  he  regarded  as  the  "  Gospel  "  shines  out.He  had  a  definite  system  of  theology;  and  he  attached  importance  to  it.  Most  clearly  was  he  inthe  habit  of  stating  such  positions  in  the  lecture-room  on  Wednesday  evening,  or  to  his  Ladies'Bible  class  on  a  week-day  afternoon.  Yet  eventhen  it  was  not  a  theology  he  taught  so  much  asa  message  he  delivered.  His  theological  systemAND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE     241was  the  eclectic  evangelical  Calvinism  prevalent  in  evangelical  circles  in  the  United  Kingdom,  after  the  great  religious  movements  of  theEighteenth  Century.  It  lacked  the  sharp  definite  structure  of  the  theologies  of  the  SeventeenthCentury,  but  more  than  made  up  for  that  by  thegentleness  of  tone,  and  the  emphasis  upon  Godas  the  believer's  Father.  It  is  a  dangerous  thingto  attempt  to  formulate  any  one  else's  faith  in  afew  words,  and  yet  so  simple  and  so  clear  werethe  outlines  of  the  system  that  underlay  all  myfather's  preaching  and  teaching  that  justice  can  atleast  be  partly  done  to  it.He  accepted  simply  the  doctrine  of  the  Trinityas  a  mystery,  but  a  mystery  in  the  sense  that  it  wasdeclared,  and  in  its  declaration  was  an  aid  to  faithand  devotion.  At  one  time  he  was  attracted  tothe  "  Kenosis"  or  "  emptying  "  theory  to  explainthe  twofold  nature  of  Jesus  Christ,  but  soonturned  definitely  away  from  it  and  all  explanations,  preaching  simply  the  perfect  manhood,and  absolute  divinity  of  Jesus  Christ.  Hereagain  he  accepted  the  modifications  in  Christol-ogy  brought  about  by  the  evangelical  revival,and  Jesus  as  the  man  suffering  with  us  had  constant  place  in  his  proclamation.  Once  in  theearly  days  of  his  ministry  in  New  York  he  was242     THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGasked  to  preach  at  Harvard,  and  knowing  something,  by  report,  of  the  atmosphere  there  he  determined  to  preach  Jesus  as  attractively  but  asstrongly  as  he  courteously  could.  He  had  metDr.  Peabody  on  his  trip  to  America,  in  1867,  butin  some  way  did  not  recognize  him  on  the  platform.  Dr.  Peabody  walked  home  with  him  andspoke  so  warmly  of  the  sermon  that  my  fatherassumed  that  his  companion  was  in  full  sympathy  with  the  trinitarian  position,  and  saidsomething  about  his  object  in  thus  speaking;then  Dr.  Peabody  made  himself  known  and  remarked  that  if  Jesus  Christ  had  been  so  presentedin  the  days  of  the  Unitarian  struggle,  manywould  have  kept  their  places  in  evangelicalcircles.  He  held  firmly  to  the  theory  of  theatonement  as  a  sacrifice  to  satisfy  an  abstract  outraged  Justice;  but  held  that  God's  love  vindicated  itself  in  providing  the  ransom  and  in  accepting  the  substitution;  thus  as  he  saw  it,  maintaining  the  moral  order  of  the  universe  andrevealing  the  Father's  love.  At  the  same  time  hedefinitely  proclaimed  this  theory  only  as  the  onethat  satisfied  his  judgment  best,  while  havingpatience  with  other  theories  so  long  as  the  sacrificialnature  of  the  atonement  was  involved.His  theory  of  inspiration  remained  an  unshakenAND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE     243faith  that  whatever  errors  transcription  mighthave  introduced  into  the  pages  as  we  have  them,that  inerrancy  in  a  very  strict  sense  was  to  be  attributed  to  the  inspired  word.  In  early  life  hehad  attacked  with  a  good  deal  of  severity  thepremilleniarian  views  so  frequently  found  inevangelical  circles.  Though  he  never  adoptedthem  he  became  markedly  more  patient  withthem  in  later  life,  and  clung  to  the  faith  that  theJews  as  a  nation  were  yet  to  be  converted,  andthat  then  the  "fullness  of  the  Gentiles"  wouldcome  in.  Rather  remarkable,  indeed,  is  the  history  of  this  hope.  He  had  it  from  his  mother,who  in  turn  had  it  from  her  cousin  the  Rev.Wm.  Magowan  who  was  minister  in  MountMorris,  where  stood  the  parish  church,  and  whobaptized  my  father.  Mr.  Magowan  gave  a  greatdeal  of  time  and  strength  to  work  for  convertingthe  Jews,  and  when  the  mother  was  compelledto  say  good-bye  to  her  eldest  son  going  as  aminister  to  New  York,  she  left  on  record  the  factthat  in  her  sorrow  her  one  comfort  was  that  her"boy  would  be  preaching  to  many  nations,  andmight  evangelize  many  of  God's  Israel."In  the  refinements  of  theological  speculationhe  had  little  interest.  For  him  the  theology  thatresolved  the  doubts  of  the  ordinary  theologically244    THE  NEW  CHURCH  BUILDINGuntrained  hearer  was  sufficient.  He  knew  nothing  of  German  speculative  theology,  and  was  inclined  to  regard  it  as  useless  if  not  dangerous,  atthe  same  time  felt  that  a  trained  minister  whohad  the  opportunity  should  master  it  if  he  could.Very  early  in  the  theological  training  of  the  present  writer  he  advised  acquiring  a  knowledge  ofFrench  and  German,  and  more  than  once  he  himself  undertook  the  study  of  French.  Yet  he  didnot  feel  the  necessity  for  his  own  thought  ofwork  along  the  directions  of  modern  speculation,and  scientific  enquiry.  He  was  apt  to  distrustnew  phraseology,  and  felt  even  some  measure  ofimpatience  with  those  whom  the  older  phrasesno  longer  satisfied,  and  who  were  compelled  torecast  the  forms  in  which  faith  was  expressed.In  a  life  of  such  ceaseless  activity,  in  a  theologyin  which  a  deep  and  constant  Christian  experience  was  the  real  basis,  the  intellectual  elementsalthough  not  wanting  did  not  play  the  principalpart.  There  was  firm  faith  that  the  system  ofevangelical  teachings,  that  even  the  round  ofevangelical  formulae  which  seemed  most  consonant  with  Scripture,  would  stand  the  mostsearching  tests,  but  the  application  of  those  testsmy  father  was  content  to  leave  to  others.  Andfor  the  most  part  he  confined  himself  to  the  factsAND  ENLARGING  INFLUENCE    245of  Christian  experience,  and  had  therefore  amongthose  whom  he  deeply  influenced  many  whoseintellectual  life  and  whose  intellectual  convictionsdiffered  greatly  from  his  own.X.

To  many  the  extreme  earnestness  of  the  pulpit  ministrations  seemed  to  excludeany  humorous  side,  as  my  father  never  raised  alaugh  or  even  often  caused  a  smile  while  preaching.  At  the  same  time  he  was  gifted  with  akeen  sense  of  humor,  had  many  a  good  story,and  in  public  address  had  a  most  happy  way  ofputting  the  audience  in  touch  with  him  by  somewhimsical  remark.  Yet  even  here  the  smile  wasmerely  a  means  to  an  end,  and  the  end  was  seldom  merely  amusement.The  present  writer  does  not  know  whetherany  special  pedagogic  theories  ever  occupied  thefather's  attention,  but  the  circumstances  of  achanging  field  of  work  did  somewhat  disturbthe   educational    plans    for  the  family.     In   the249250  HOME  LIFEhome  books  were  on  hand  on  all  sorts  of  subjects,and  interest  in  a  great  variety  of  topics  was  cultivated.  The  home  life  included  great  freedomof  both  thought  and  action.  A  note  in  a  strayengagement  book  marks  the  fact  "to-day  securedfor  Dick,  Darwin's  '  Descent  of  Man.'  "  As  theboy  was  only  then  fifteen  and  Darwin  in  1874was  being  denounced  from  nearly  every  pulpit,and  in  the  columns  of  the  weekly  religious  pressas  the  arch-destroyer  of  the  faith,  and  as  myfather  himself,  so  far  as  the  present  writer'sknowledge  goes,  never  accepted  Darwin's  views,such  an  entry  marks  the  spirit  of  freedom  in  whichthe  family  grew  up.  To  some  degree  the  verycatholicity  of  the  man  sprang  from  the  sure  faithin  him  that  he  had  common  sense  and  truth  onhis  side  so  evidently  and  so  strongly  that  it  onlyneeded  statement  to  convince  any  right  understanding.  He  felt  that  things  must  be  arguedout,  and  had  little  fear  as  to  the  ultimate  result  ofthe  argument.  Moreover  his  dealings  with  RomanCatholic  methods,  and  his  strong  Protestantismmade  him,  as  it  made  Dr.  Henry  Cooke  histeacher,  afraid  of  suppressive  measures.  Freedom  of  teaching  was  such  a  dire  necessity  in  Ireland  that  anything  that  seemed  to  threaten  it  hesaw  to  be  a  calamity.  Given  a  fair  field  and  heAND  SUMMER  TRAVELS          251felt  fully  persuaded  that  the  system  of  evangelical  theology  must  in  the  end  win  the  day.The  great  big  preacher,  who  so  often  toweredon  the  platform  above  all  the  rest,  was  exceedingly  gentle.  He  could  be  pained  and  vexed,but  probably  no  one  ever  saw  him  angry.  Children  took  naturally  to  him,  and  climbed  up  without  fear  on  his  knee  to  hear  a  repeating  watch,kept  largely  for  their  amusement,  strike  the  hoursand  minutes.  And  hence  he  could  talk  and  writeto-  children.  Although  his  preaching  was  oftenon  a  devotional  and  spiritual  level  far  above  achild's  comprehension,  yet  his  language  seldomwas  so,  and  as  children  we  and  our  childish  companions  dreaded  any  other  preacher  taking  hisplace  in  the  pulpit.  The  most  distinct  childishimpressions  are  of  a  very  busy  man,  always  having  something  that  had  to  be  done  at  a  specialtime,  and  of  one  who  now  and  then  greatly  rejoiced  all  the  children's  hearts  by  taking  "a  longwalk"  with  them.  Into  the  study  the  childrenwere  always  free  to  go,  to  get  a  piece  of  paper,  abit  of  string  or  a  word  of  help,  and  the  usualgreeting  was  "Well,  dear,  what  can  I  do  foryou?"  The  study  was  the  scene  of  the  wildestdisorder.  Letters,  clippings,  magazines  with  theleaves  turned  down,  filled  every  nook  and  corner.252  HOME  LIFEThe  bookcases  and  the  very  walls  were  decoratedwith  half-sheets  of  paper  containing  engagements,notices,  addresses,  memoranda  of  all  kinds.  Inthe  earlier  life  such  was  the  power  of  memorypossessed  that  each  piece  of  paper  could  be  turnedto,  and  each  letter  was  at  hand.  In  later  years  asearch  had  occasionally  to  be  entered  upon,  andthe  reforming  spirit  once  or  twice  took  hold  ofthe  chaos,  and  order  reigned — for  a  little  while."It  is,"  he  said  occasionally,  "my  litter-aryworkshop,"  and  the  litter  none  dare  ruthlesslytouch  lest  some  important  letter  on  the  top  mighthide  itself  at  the  bottom.  He  read  rapidly  andmiscellaneously  and  more  than  once  remarkedthat  "  it  had  to  be  a  very  bad  book  from  whichone  could  not  get  something."  The  writings  ofWhately  influenced  him  deeply,  and  books  ofpure  theology  did  not  attract  him.  Refined  speculation,  or  abstract  critical  processes  were  notcongenial  ground.  His  amusements  were  of  thesimplest  character.  He  played  now  and  then  agame  of  "draughts"  or  "checkers,"  and  playeda  very  good  game.  Now  and  then,  thoughvery,  very  rarely,  he  went  to  a  concert,  andnothing  pleased  him  so  much  as  a  little  musicin  the  home.  He  had  no  systematic  knowledgeof  music,  yet  picked  out  what  pleased  him,  andAND  SUMMER  TRAVELS          253the  opening  movement  of  the  "moonlight"sonata  by  Beethoven  was  what  he  most  admired,although  he  did  not  realize  at  all  the  historic  position  of  Beethoven  as  a  composer,  and  knew  it  as"the  piece  that  Jenny  plays."  On  the  continenthe  was  fond  of  spending  an  evening  at  a  music-garden,  and  watched  the  program  with  someamusement  over  the  unfamiliar  names.  Whatpleased  him  best  in  these  performances  were  themarches  from  the  works  of  Wagner,  and  thesomewhat  wild  Hungarian  music  made  popularby  Brahms.He  seldom  had  time  for  even  "a  walk,"  merelyas  a  walk,  but  often  he  found  a  few  visits  had  tobe  made  out  of  the  regular  round,  and  then  itwas  a  pleasure  to  him  to  summon  one  of  us  toenjoy  with  him  a  stroll  on  the  way.  Wildscenery  attracted  him  most  strongly,  and  thelonely  desolation  of  Colorado  made  a  deep  impression  on  him,  but  for  pictorial  art  he  had  butlittle  feeling.Sometimes  those  near  him  thought  he  sacrificedtoo  much  of  his  time  and  strength  and  self  for  thesake  of  heeding  all  sorts  of  outside  claims  uponhim.  He  ministered  to  all  who  came.  Thehouse  had  almost  no  protection  for  him,  frommorning  to  evening  a  stream  of  callers,  generally254  HOME  LIFEon  their  own  errands,  stormed  the  door,  and  whenat  home  he  saw  them  all.  Scarcely  an  uninterrupted  meal  was  ever  his  portion,  and  only  inthe  late  hours  of  the  night  could  he  be  sure  ofany  seclusion.Of  social  life  in  the  strict  sense  he  knew  almostnothing.  A  rare  dinner-party,  once  or  twice  aspeech  at  a  public  banquet,  now  and  then  a  fewfriends  to  ''tea  "  was  all  the  formal  social  life  heever  had.  He  avoided  purely  social  functions,and  had  no  time  for  formal  entertainment.  OnSunday  evenings  the  tea-table  welcomed  a  number  of  young  men,  some  the  friends  of  his  sons,some  "strangers,"  some  the  sons  of  old  Irishfriends,  who  had  their  homes  in  America.  Yethe  rarely  was  able  to  sit  through  that  meal,  for  anengagement  to  preach  somewhere  would  compelhim  to  excuse  himself  and  hurry  away  leavingsome  course  untouched.  As  he  walked  thestreets  he  thought  out  his  sermons  and  articles,often  making  a  note  or  two  on  an  envelope  whilewaiting  for  the  family  called  upon  to  appear.He  was  always  gentle  and  considerate,  with  anative  grace  that  art  could  add  little  to,  and  therewas  absolutely  no  difference  in  the  way  he  spoketo  or  treated  the  most  exalted  rank  or  the  mostignorant  servant  girl.  To  all  he  was  the  sameAND  SUMMER  TRAVELS          255kindly,  fatherly  gentleman.  He  attached  importance  to  good  manners,  and  lamented  sometimes  the  "  boorishness"  of  other  wise  usefulministers.  To  an  Irish  theological  student  hewrote  urging  him  to  make  the  most  of  somehome  life  in  Belfast  as  "an  opportunity  of  cultivating  the  Christian  refinement  a  minister  somuch  needs."He  was  himself  also  extremely  active  for  solarge  a  man,  and  many  will  ever  remember  acertain  grace  and  dignity  with  which  he  mountedthe  pulpit.  He  had  a  love  for  order  and  reverence  in  church  services,  though  disliking  all  elaborate  ritual.  His  taste  in  these  matters  wasrefined  and  simple,  and  nothing  annoyed  him  somuch  in  the  pulpit,  or  on  the  platform  as  to  havea  fussy  man  whispering  arrangements,  choosinghymns,  arranging  the  parts  of  the  service.  Hefelt  that  all  such  things  could  and  should  be  arranged  beforehand,  noted  on  paper,  and  thencarried  out  without  distraction  and  fuss.So  busy  a  life  needed  year  by  year  change  andrest.  Hence  each  summer  was  given  over  to"vacations."  In  point  of  fact  more  work  wasoften  accomplished  in  such  a  "  vacation  "  than  theaverage  man  gets  done  in  his  busy  season.  Except  for  a  few  weeks  on  the  continent  my  father256  HOME  LIFEgenerally  preached  every  Sunday  the  year  round,and  often  once  or  twice  in  the  week.  In  Irelandor  England  he  was  in  constant  demand,  andraised  debts,  laid  corner-stones,  and  preachedspecial  sermons  by  way  of  recreation.  Yet  thevacation  was  both  rest  and  change  for  him.  Theburden  of  his  pastoral  visitation  was  laid  down.He  also  gained  from  his  travels  new  inspirationsand  materials  for  his  ceaseless  production  of  sermons  and  articles.  All  through  the  vacations  hisliterary  work  went  on.  He  would  pause  a  dayon  his  journey  to  complete  a  Sunday-schoollesson  or  finish  a  contribution  promised  to  somereview  or  newspaper.The  first  trips  to  the  continent  as  already  mentioned  were  made  from  Dublin,  when  Paris,  Rome,Switzerland,  the  Rhine  and  the  principal  placesof  interest  along  the  tourists'  highroad  werevisited.  Again  in  1869  he  visited  the  continentand  kept  a  careful  diary  of  the  journey.  At  Bernhe  records  the  fact  that  he  "saw  the  FederalParliament  in  session.  It  resembles  in  arrangements  the  Senate  of  the  United  States  and  isorderly  and  impressive,"  and  he  was  impressedagain  and  again  by  the  "views  from  the  passesof  rugged,  bare,  bold,  precipitous  rocks,  of  cliffsoverhanging  mighty  depths,  of  the  angry  riversAND  SUMMER  TRAVELS          257chafing  along  through  hindering  rocks  as  theydashed  in  mad  leaps  down  the  mountainsides,  andthen  of  bits  of  utter  and  dreary  desolation,  whererugged  nature  wars  with  man  as  an  intruderupon  her  solitude;  and  of  quiet  strength  andconfidence  as  snow-capped  peaks  lift  themselvesup  into  the  blue  of  heaven,  far-reaching  evenover  cloud  and  storm."That  same  year  he  made  a  little  trip  alone  toOxford  and  Cambridge,  but  felt  a  little  lonely,  infact  so  much  so  "as  almost  to  destroy  at  timesthe  pleasure  of  seeing  places  which  I  have  wantedto  see  for  twenty  years,  but  for  which  I  hadneither  time  nor  money  until  now."  The  firstsermon  he  heard  in  London  was  by  Spurgeon,"a  magnificent  and  yet  simple  sermon."  Thecontinental  services  were  less  pleasing,  althoughhe  attended  them  regularly.  At  one  place  thejournal  remarks  with  some  force  "  thence  to  theRue     (Paris)  where  we  saw  and  heard  a  sermon!  From  the  intolerable  affectation  of  thepreacher,  it  was  fitted  to  do  only  evil  to  mostpeople.  The  honest  and  painful  truth  is  thatsince  we  set  out  we  did  not  hear  one  thoroughlygood  sermon  or  enjoy  a  genuine  service  anywhere!"  In  1872  a  visit  was  made  by  the  wholefamily  to  California.  This  really  tremendous  un-258  HOME:  LIFEdertaking  turned  out  very  well,  and  everywheremeetings  and  preaching  made  his  voice  knownon  the  western  coast.  In  an  article  for  the  NewYork  Ledger  he  marked  some  of  his  impressions  of  Yosemite  valley."  It  is  after  midday,  and  a  cool  wind  is  singing  through  the  pines,  the  sound  of  which  it  isimpossible  to  distinguish  from  that  of  the  fallsin  front  of  this  hotel."The  valley  runs  about  east  and  west,  and  theeast  end  is  called  the  head.  It  is  any  length  youplease  under  ten  miles,  according  as  you  fix  itsending  or  its  beginning.  It  is  about  a  milebroad  in  the  level  portion,  and  if  one  includesthe  gradual  rise  to  the  precipices  formed  byfallen  debris,  it  is  rather  more  from  rock  to  rock.The  points  about  it  are  not  the  great  height  ofthe  surrounding  mountains,  but  their  nearness,which  implies  their  steepness,  and  the  impressive  forms  they  assume."Once  in  the  valley,  the  sights  are  the  following:  Bridal  Veil  Fall  goes  with  Inspiration  Point;Vernal  and  Nevada  Falls,  at  the  head  or  east  endof  the  valley,  occupy  a  day  profitably,  and  if  youhave  come  in  by  Inspiration  Point,  another  dayis  due  to  Glacier  Point.

There  isNorth  Dome,  now  seen  to  be  rounded  only  onthree  sides,  on  the  fourth  ending  a  long  mountain  ridge.  There  is  Washington  Column,  whichlooks  as  if  set  up  to  secure  the  dome  against  anyrisk  of  toppling  over  into  the  river  below.  Tothe  right  of  it  is  South  Dome,  the  western  half  ofit  fallen  out  apparently,  itself  hard,  bare  and  inaccessible.  Watkins  Mount,  Mount  Broderick,and  other  elevations,  are  under  his  eye.

That  wasin  1874,  and  in  1876  he  crossed  on  the  sad  occasion  of  losing  his  aged  and  tenderly  lovedmother,  who  passed  away  at  an  advanced  age.To  that  mother  the  son  had  been  nothing  butcomfort,  and  she  slept  in  peace  in  the  arms  ofHim  whom  she  taught  her  son  to  love,  reverenceand  proclaim.It  was  always  a  great  source  of  pleasure  formy  father  to  stop  a  little  in  London,  to  walk  itscrowded  streets,  to  climb  up  on  the  top  of  a"bus"  and  discourse  with  'Arry  who  answeredhim  in  his  best  cockney,  with  a  short  pipe  between  his  teeth.

The  impressions  of  that  debate  are  recorded  in  a  letterprinted  in  a  weekly  paper."The  night  which  the  present  writer  gave  tothe  House  was  occupied  by  a  debate  on  IrishHome  Rule,  and  gave  a  good  opportunity  to  notethe  characteristics  of  the  House  as  developed  inrecent  years.  To  state  these  as  they  appeared,  isthe  purpose  of  this  column."When  1  first  made  the  acquaintance  of  theHouse,  a  certain  freedom  and  ease  of  speech,  ofwhich  Lord  Palmerston  was  the  type,  had  begunto  displace  the  formal,  stately,  and  Johnsonianstyle  which  Disraeli  at  first  affected.  Mr.  Brightappeared  to  me  to  have  the  happy  medium  asbetween  the  two.  He  spoke  plain  English,largely  Saxon,  and  with  an  ease  that  did  not  sacrifice  dignity.  In  those  days  the  speaker  wasaddressed  throughout,  and  personalities  wererare.  The  change  in  this  respect  is  amazing.Take  an  instance.  An  opposition  leader,  leaningboth  arms  on  the  table,  and  looking  over  it  intothe  faces  of  'the  government,'  says —  'Thecourse  you  are  now  taking  is  a  sham.'  '  No,  no,'cry  members  on  the  government  side.  'Thecourse  you  are  taking  is  a  sham,'  repeats  the  honorable  member,  and  the  'No,  no,'  comes  again.AND  SUMiMER  TRAVELS          263'  If  honorable  members  will  persist  in  their  "No,no,"  they  will  oblige  me  to  repeat  my  assertion:The  course  you  are  taking  is  a  sham,' — and,  trueto  his  threat,  he  repeated  it  till  the  'No,  no,'  wasgiven  up  in  despair.  This  incident  is  a  specimenof  a  new  style  introduced  into  the  debates,  which— with  charges  of  inconsistency,  double-minded-ness,  insincerity  and  the  like — does  not  indicateadvance  in  the  direction  of  dignity."  It  is  known  to  most  of  our  readers  that  members  wear  their  hats,  unless  when  speaking  orgoing  in  or  out  of  the  house.  As  the  morningcame  in — the  writer  remained  till  after  twoo'clock — many  were  asleep  and  their  easy  attitudes  corresponded.  Indeed,  on  the  side  galleriesa  couple  of  gentlemen  stretched  themselves,  and—one  wishes  to  be  parliamentary — slept  so  audibly  that  had  they  been  on  the  floor  the  speakermight  have  been  expected  to  call  out  '  order.'  Itis  easy  to  see  how  in  such  conditions  the  tone  ofa  meeting  goes  down,  and  men  readily  glide  intowhat  would  hardly  seem  gentlemanly.  A  member,  for  example,  makes  his  speech,  and  the  nextspeaker  says  on  rising:  'The  honorable  memberwho  has  just  sat  down,  entered  the  House  eighteen  months  ago,  and  made  the  speech  to  whichwe  have  listened  to-night,  and  many  times  be-264  HOME  LIFEfore.  If  the  honorable  gentleman  has  nothingelse  to  say  he  should  save  the  time  of  the  House.'It  is  common  to  credit  Americans  with  very  freespeech,  but  after  twenty  years'  familiarity  withAmerican  public  meetings,  the  writer  remembersnothing  more  free — in  the  sense  of  defective  dignity — than  portions  of  this  debate."Often  as  he  crossed  the  sea  yet  the  voyage  always  interested  my  father.  In  one  place  he  givesan  amusing  description  of  the  more  unpleasantside  of  the  trip.  He  at  first  having  suffered  asothers  do."  But,  on  the  first  day,  if  the  weather  be  propitious,  the  deck  is  well  covered  with  people  intheir  land  costume.  Introductions  are  being  enjoyed;  reminiscences  are  being  exchanged.  'Wecrossed  together  on  the  Germania,  or  the  Serbia,was  it  ? '  The  sea  is  smooth,  the  sky  is  bright.'What  an  auspicious  start  we  are  having,'  saythe  passengers  to  one  another.  Pleasant  groupsare  gathered  together,  and  the  '  pleasures  ofhope'  are  enjoyed  in  common.  Old  sea-goersare  selecting  the  places  for  their  chairs,  and  making  little  arrangements,  and  when  the  first  mealis  served  the  tables  are  crowded.  The  afternoonchanges  matters  a  little.  '  The  sea  is  treacherous,you  know.'  Some  were  very  busy  before  start-AND  SUMMER  TRAVELS          265ing,  and  need  a  little  rest.  Some  are  very — well,there  is  no  use  in  hiding  it — uncomfortable — infact,  seasick."There  are  two  experiences  on  board  whichnotably  interfere  with  comfort.  The  one  is  fog.The  Atlantic  is  an  admirable  ocean,  particularlyour  side  of  it,  where  it  touches  Coney  Island,Long  Branch,  Newport  and  Narragansett;  but  itis  subject  to  fogs,  especially  as  one  approachesthe  slice  of  it  that  British  America  claims.  Nodoubt  if  the  Atlantic  were  put  on  its  defense  itcould  defend  itself.  '  If  cold  waves  and  currentscome  down  from  the  north  and  mingle  with  mygenial  waters  how  can  I  help  it  ? '  But  whateverthe  defense,  the  fact  as  seen  by  the  eye,  felt  allover  the  body  and  damp  clothes,  and  forced  intothe  ears  by  the  foghorn  is  real  and  depressing.And  when  your  cautious  captain,  mindful  of  thecollision  in  which  the  Celtic  and  Britannic  hurtone  another,  (how  long  Celts  and  Britons  havebeen  in  collision  and  with  what  painful  consequences!) — when  the  captain  slows  down  andeven  stops  the  ship,  what  gloom  and  suspensefill  the  thick,  dull  atmosphere!"  It  is  a  comfort  that  fog  and  storm  do  notcome  together.  The  latter  is  the  second  disturber  of  the  peace.  '  Isn't  there  a  little  more266  HOME  LIFEmotion  in  the  ship?'  'The  wind,  I  think,  is  rising  a  little.'  '  Has  it  been  blowing  here  ?  Theredoes  not  seem  wind  enough  to  make  thesewaves.'  'I  think  I'll  go  below;'  and  he  or  shegoes,  rather  nervously  and  unceremoniously —these,  with  the  closing  of  the  port-holes,  and  theplacing  of  '  guards  '  on  the  tables,  and  the  verymarked  decrease  of  occupants  of  them,  areamong  the  symptoms  of  'a  little  rough  weather.'You  go  on  deck  for  the  fresh  air,  but  it  is  coldand  damp.  You  have  to  lean  right  or  left  as  youwalk,  to  watch  against  a  salt  shower-bath,  tokeep  out  of  the  way  of  sailors  settling  ropes,  towatch  your  feet.  You  decide  to  'go  down.'  Itis  a  little  difficult  to  manage  things  below.  Thatsea-trunk  of  yours  has  grown  restless.  Combsand  brushes  catch  the  spirit  of  the  occasion.

Yes,there  are  little  inconveniences  to  the  average  passenger."Many  and  many  a  person  has  said  to  the  pres-AND  SUMMER  TRAVELS          267ent  writer,  "We  heard  your  father  preach  onboard  the  steamship  so  and  so."  Among  thesteerage  passengers  he,  also,  usually  held  a  service,  and  generally  discovered  before  the  voyagewas  over  just  how  many  north  of  Ireland  Protestants  were  on  the  ship's  list.  He  once  spent  almost  the  entire  summer  in  Germany,  and  although  he  did  not  speak  the  language  he  pickedup  many  vivid  impressions.  Some  he  recordedas  follows:"The  solidity  of  everything  of  German  construction  is  an  obvious  characteristic.  Things  aremade  to  stand.  There  are  no  '  shanties.'  Thewindow  frames  and  doors  are  meant  for  generations.  The  keys  of  houses  and  rooms  are  madewithout  regard  to  the  cost  of  the  metal.  Thestreets  are  paved  with  enormous  stones,  and  appear  to  last.  So  it  is  with  the  common  highwaysin  many  places.  They  recall  the  old  Romanroads.  The  wagons  are  enormously  heavy,  andonly  matched  by  the  weight  of  the  harness  onthe  horses.  One  sees  collars  on  brewers'  dray-horses  which  seem  a  load  in  themselves,  and  onwhich  are  piled  heavy  brass  decorations  that  recall  the  armor  of  the  middle  ages.  No  wonderthat  they  move  with  a  slow  gravity,  as  if  conscious  of  the  greatness  of  the  interests  they  rep-268  HOME  LIFEresent,  and  there  is  a  corresponding  feature  in  theminor  arrangements  of  life."Now  a  good  deal  of  this  is  unnecessary  andsome  of  it  provokes  a  smile.  But  the  question  is— are  we  not  in  danger  of  erring  on  the  otherside  ?  We  are  rapid,  inventive,  familiar  withchange,  content  to  secure  the  present,  willing  tohave  the  future  take  care  of  itself.  We  aim  atbeing  '  smart  '  rather  than  solid.  Our  Germanfellow-citizens  may  help  us  to  the  happy  medium."In  1883  a  sad  shadow  came  over  my  father'slife.  He  greatly  rejoiced  in  the  success  andpromise  of  my  cousin  John  Magowan,  who  hadtaken  his  last  year  at  Union  Theological  Seminary,and  who  had  most  successfully  begun  his  workat  the  Canal  Street  Presbyterian  Church.  In  agreat  many  ways  the  presence  of  his  nephew  inthe  city  and  in  the  presbytery  had  been  a  greatsource  of  gratification  to  him.  Then  the  splendidpromise  of  wide  influence  for  good  was  cut  shortby  sudden  illness;  and  a  life  that  had  been  filledwith  sweetness  and  hope  ended  on  November26th,  in  the  early  dawn  of  the  Monday  morning.It  was  under  the  family  roof  that  the  illness  hadits  fatal  termination,  and  the  dear  remains  rest  inWoodlawn,  and  the  spirit  is  with  God  whogave  it.AND  SUMMER  TRAVELS          269The  shock  to  my  father  was  very  great,  and  henever  trusted  himself  to  speak  much  about  oneto  whom  he  was  deeply  attached,  and  fromwhom  he  with  good  reason  expected  greatthings.  Side  by  side  they  now  await  the  resurrection!On  November  the  sgthof  1891,  the  communitywas  startled  by  the  report  of  the  attempted  assassination  of  my  father.  He  came  walking  rapidlyfrom  the  church  and  alone  up  to  the  steps  of  thehouse,  when  an  insane  man,  John  G.  Roth,  towhom  he  had  given  some  trifling  help,  attempted  his  life  with  a  revolver.  Three  shotswere  fired,  but  although  fired  at  a  distance  ofscarcely  ten  feet,  none  took  effect.  The  arrestof  the  man  followed,  and  it  was  found  that  hewas  an  unfortunate  but  dangerous  lunatic.  Aftergoing  to  the  police  court  to  identify  his  assailanthe  went  into  his  pulpit  to  preach  the  sermon  hehad  prepared,  and  in  the  evening  preached  inClasson  Avenue  Presbyterian  Church,  Brooklyn.On  him  the  incident  seemed  to  have  left  little  impression,  except  of  thankfulness  to  God  for  hisescape,  and  certainly  his  wonderful  coolness  inquietly  opening  the  door  while  the  man  wasfiring  at  him  was  noteworthy  and  perhaps  savedhis  life.  Hundreds  of  letters  and  telegrams  from270  HOME  LIFEall  over  the  country  and  from  Europe  brought  himcongratulations  upon  his  wonderful  escape.  Theunfortunate  man  was  at  once  placed  under  care,his  condition  being  that  of  dangerous  insanity.The  public  man  in  America  has  a  constantproblem  to  solve  in  his  relations  to  the  dailypress.  On  the  one  hand  no  sensible  man  fails  tosee  the  great  influence  for  good  and  evil  yieldedby  these  daily  publications;  yet  on  the  other  handthe  irresponsible  character  and  the  untrustworth-iness  in  general  and  in  detail  breeds  a  great  distrust  of  that  influence.  This  distrust  was  deeplyrooted  in  my  father.  On  the  whole  he  wasalways  well  treated  by  the  papers,  in  general  thedaily  press  sought  to  say  pleasant  things  abouthim  and  his  work.  Yet  the  emphasis  placedupon  just  those  features  of  his  work  which  gavehim  the  least  satisfaction  always  greatly  annoyedhim.  Very  soon  after  beginning  work  in  NewYork  some  correspondent  described  him  as  outon  Harlem  Lane — at  that  time  the  meeting-placefor  fast  trotters — behind  a  pair  of  fast  horses.Probably  the  correspondent  meant  no  harm,  ormistook  for  him  a  distant  relative  of  my  father'sbearing  the  same  name,  and  being  a  medical  doctor  bearing  also  the  same  title.  At  the  same  timethe  report  was  promptly  "  paragraphed  "  all  overAND  SUMMER  TRAVELS          271the  country,  and  even  now  might  at  any  timeturn  up  in  the  "  plates  "  of  some  country  paper.No  denials,  although  promptly  made,  and  no  corrections  in  the  columns  of  the  Boston  paper,  although  they  too  were  at  once  forthcoming,  madeany  difference;  year  after  year  the  paragraph,"  Dr.  Hall  on  Harlem  Lane  "  made  its  appearanceas  regularly  as  the  roses  came  in  spring  or  thejoke  about  the  plumber  adorns  the  winter  columns  of  the  funny  paper.Another  report,  as  absurd,  about  the  enormousfortune  my  father  was  supposed  to  possess  stilllives,  and  circulates  even  now  with  statelygravity  in  the  columns  of  papers  in  far  Russia  aswell  as  in  Germany  and  France.  His  correspondence  brought  him  begging  letters  fromEgypt,  Japan,  China,  India,  Sweden,  Germany,Russia,  Spain,  and  indeed  all  European  lands.Generally  the  begging  letters  enclosed  a  clippingfrom  the  paper  of  the  country  giving  the  figures  on  which  the  correspondents  based  theirhopes.  No  contradictions  availed  at  all.  Contradictions  and  corrections  are  not  "  paragraphed."  As  a  matter  of  fact  such  were  thedemands  upon  the  city  pastor  with  a  large  familyand  of  necessity  living  in  a  certain  style,  that  although  the  salary  was  large  and  the  house  free,272  HOME  LIFEand  the  living  very  simple— no  carriage  or  horsesever  being  maintained — no  money  was  ever  savedfrom  the  yearly  salary.  All  the  small  fortunethat  was  left  the  widow  was  earned  with  thepen  or  was  the  result  of  a  kindly  legacy  left  bya  dear  and  devoted  friend.  The  home  life  wassimple.  Of  formal  entertainment,  as  has  beensaid,  there  was  none.  At  lunch  and  dinner  therewas  always  room  for  any  one  whom  my  fatheror  one  of  the  children  would  ask  to  stay  and  partake  of  the  meal  with  the  family.  And  of  suchhospitality  there  was  abundance,  but  formal  entertainment  was  made  simply  impossible  by  thebusy  and  constantly  interrupted  life  into  whichyear  by  year  my  father  drifted.  Such  was  thehome  life.  In  many  ways  it  was  too  public,  tooincessantly  interrupted,  too  restlessly  engaged,to  be  an  ideal  home  life.  Yet  circumstancesmade  it  such,  and  that  was  one  of  the  manysacrifices  demanded  by  a  public  life  upon  whichevery  one  deemed  himself  as  having  a  claim.XI.

REVISION.  MISUNDERSTAND-INGS.  COUNSELS  REJECTED.  THE  CASE  OF  DR.  BRIGGSUNION  SEMINARY.  ATTITUDE  TOWARDS  EXTREMISTSCONCEPTION  OF  FUNDAMENTALS.MANY  who  knew  my  father  well  have  admired  his  powers  of  debate  and  his  clearness  in  statement  in  controversy.  He  did  not,however,  either  welcome  argument  or  like  debate.  He  could  handle  a  sharp  sword  when  itwas  necessary,  but  he  loved  peace,  and  generallyavoided  a  struggle  if  he  could  do  so.  At  thesame  time  he  now  and  then  was  pricked  intosharp  rejoinder  and  most  decided  action.  FromProfessor  Tyndal  he  exacted  at  one  time  anapology,  by  exposing  inaccuracies  in  public  statement  in  a  sharp  and  almost  scathing  manner.  Inhis  Dublin  controversy  he  most  firmly  maintainedhis  ground  against  some  of  the  ablest  debaters  oftheir  generation.  When  in  1889  the  questioncame  up  before  the  New  York  Presbytery  on  theinitiative  of  the  General  Assembly  as  to  the  advisability  of  a  revision  of  the  Confession  of  Faith,275276  CONTROVERSY  ANDall  the  instincts  of  a  lifetime  of  service  basedupon  the  platform  of  evangelical  Calvinismprompted  to  immediate  defense  of  that  whichwas  assailed.  He  dreaded,  in  common  withmany  other  conservative  friends,  the  revision  extending  to  things  he  considered  really  valuable.For  him  God's  grace  was  bound  up  with  thedoctrine  of  man's  utter  helplessness.  He  had  nointellectual  difficulty  himself  with  the  doctrinesof  the  Confession  of  Faith,  and  a  most  sincereadmiration  for  the  Shorter  Catechism:  he,  moreover,  deeply  and  heartily  distrusted  what  Mr.Spurgeon  called  the  "down-grade  theology."In  the  whole  revision  movement  he  rightly  sawthe  intellectual  unrest,  which  he  regarded  asdangerous.  He  had  been  taught  to  regard  theevangelical  awakening  in  Ireland  as  a  result  ofthe  reassertion  of  the  Calvinistic  system  of  theConfession  of  Faith,  and  to  attach  exceedinglygreat  importance  to  the  subscription  which  hadbeen  enforced  in  Ireland  in  1840.  There  may  beother  opinions  on  such  questions,  but  the  facthere  to  be  emphasized  is  that  the  course  of  conduct  pursued  in  the  debate  was  throughout  consistent  with  these  positions.  He  was  not  presentwhen  revision  was  overwhelmingly  decidedupon  in  the  meeting  of  November,  1889.  TheATTEMPTED  PEACEMAKING     277daily  press  announced,  of  course,  that  "Calvinism  must  now  go,"  etc.,  and  this  stirred  up  myfather  to  point  out  that  the  committee  was  notappointed  to  "alter  the  system  of  doctrine,"  andhe  in  general  defended  both  the  committee  and  thepresbytery.  This  defense  of  the  presbytery  gaverise  to  the  report  that  my  father  also  favoredrevision.  No  one,  who  really  knew  his  methodof  thought  and  was  familiar  with  his  early  training  and  opinions  could  have  made  any  such  mistake.  He  had  no  objection  to  explanations  ofthe  language  of  the  Confession  to  make  it  conform  to  the  evangelical  proclamation,  as  heunderstood  it  and  preached  it,  but  he  devoutlybelieved  that  the  Confession  of  Faith  stood  forthat  proclamation.  He  saw  in  it  only  what  hethought  he  found  in  the  ninth  chapter  of  Romans.When  then  he  joined  the  debate,  and  took  issuewith  the  committee  appointed  by  the  presbyteryto  formulate  the  changes  desired,  he  not  onlywas  not  inconsistent,  but  did  what  any  one  reallyknowing  his  views  might  have  foreseen  he  woulddo.  He  was,  however,  charged  with  inconsistency  and  defended  himself  in  the  followingstatement:"The  presbytery — when  I  was  not  present, —278  CONTROVERSY  ANDdiscussed  the  question  of  '  revision  '  in  a  styleso  revolutionary  that  the  papers  gave  out,  invarious  forms,  the  idea  that — as  they  put  it —  '  Calvinism  must  go.'"A  committee  was  appointed  to  frame  resolutions  and  indicate  the  extent  of  '  revision  '  desired.  It  began  with  strong  protestations  that  thesystem  of  doctrine  must  not  be  touched,  andthen  indicated  the  points  to  be  amended.  Atime  was  fixed  for  discussion,  which  was  notthen  entered  upon."  I  remarked  that  I  hoped  the  '  world-enlightening  editors  '  would  give  as  much  prominence  tothis  paper  as  they  had  done  to  the  other  statements.  1  referred  to  the  preservation  of  thedoctrine;  1  had  no  reference  to  the  details."In  consequence  of  this  statement,  some  ofthe  revisers — ignoring  the  facts  contemplated  inmy  words,  misapprehended  them,  and  chargedme  with  change  of  attitude,  when  opposing  theproposed  changes.  When  discussion  came  Ipointed  out  that  in  the  dropping  of  chapter  iiithe  Committee  took  exactly  the  ground  of  theCumberland  Presbyterians,  and  that  if  the  Assembly  accepted  this  change  we  must  apologizeto  them,  and  ask  them  to  join  with  us."Other  reasons  were  stated,  into  which  I  needATTEMPTED  PEACEMAKING     279not  go:  but  all  the  counter-arguments  made,  andsince  written,  only  deepen  the  conviction  that  toomany  of  the  friends  of  revision  are  not  in  sympathy  with  the  '  system  of  doctrine,'  and  that —while  an  explanatory  statement  might  avert  someincidental  evil — revision  as  favored,  would  domore  harm  than  good."  The  plea  was  made  that  our  Calvinistic  statements  kept  good  young  men  from  the  ministry.With  exclusive  regard  to  this  statement  I  calledattention  to  the  authorized  statistics  of  the  Cumberland  Presbyterian  ministry  showing  that  thewant  of  ministers  is  a  real  evil,  with  them  notwithstanding  the  elimination  of  the  matterthought  to  be  undesirable,  from  the  confession."This  allusion  to  the  Cumberland  Presbyterianscalled  forth  from  some  of  them  who  misunderstood  his  position,  sharp  criticism.  This  was  themore  inexcusable  as  he  had  fought  their  battle  inthe  "  Pan  Presbyterian  Alliance  "  when  he  urgedthat  they  should  be  included  as  belonging  tohistoric  Presbyterianism,  not  on  the  basis  of  details  of  doctrine,  but  on  the  basis  of  broadprinciples  and  history.To  this  criticism  he  replied  in  the  same  statement  already  quoted:"And  now  the  dear  Cumberland  brethren  are280  CONTROVERSY  ANDlecturing  me  for  an  attack  on  them,  when  theonly  thing  done  was  to  notice  their  condition,  aspublicly  described,1  as  an  answer  to  the  intimation  that  we  would  get  more  candidates  if  wehad  not  the  pointed  Calvinism.  My  oppositionto  the  proposed  removal  of  chapter  iii — which  isthe  main  point — is  that  to  alter  it,  as  proposed,would  require  other  alterations  to  preserve  theconsistency  of  the  whole,  and  the  truths  assailedare  as  pointedly  asserted  in  Scripture  as  in  ourConfession,  and  were  needed  then,  and  areneeded  now,  as  protests  against  errors  more  orless  congenial  to  human  pride  and  self-sufficiency."  Our  friends  sometimes  fail  to  look  at  a  statement  in  the  light  of  the  circumstances  calling  itforth,  and  the  uses  it  was  meant  to  serve.  Isthere  not  a  like  tendency  in  relation  to  statementsof  the  Confession  of  Faith,  and  the  inspired  writings  themselves  ?  "At  the  meeting  held  early  in  1890,  to  decidehow  far  revision  should  go  my  father  took  very1  The  "  public  description  "  was  from  the  St.  Louis  Observer  as  follows  :"Out  of  2,689  churches,  only  215  have  service  every  Sabbath,  and  564  have  no  regular  preaching.  Out  of  1,595  ministers,  720  give  all  their  time  to  the  preaching  of  the  Word.Not  the  one-half  of  either  churches  or  preachers  do  anythingin  the  work  of  missions."ATTEMPTED  PEACEMAKING     281strong  ground  against  what  he  considered  radicalchanges  in  the  Confession  of  Faith  as  it  stood.Even  those  who  disagreed  entirely  with  him  beartestimony  to  the  adroitness  and  force  of  his  argument  against  the  changes  proposed.  Some  ofthose  arguments  are  valid  yet,  as  he  tried  to  showthat  simply  eliminating  a  chapter  without  otherand  more  radical  changes  would  not  improveconditions,  and  would  spoil  the  Confessionalstatement.The  movement  for  revision  was  however,  sostrong  that  he  felt  something  might  be  said  tocorrect  wrong  impressions.  Hence  he  proposedthe  following  resolutions,  in  answer  to  the  Assembly's  question:Resolved,  i.  That,  endorsing  the  committee'sadherence  to  the  system  of  doctrine  contained  inour  standards,  we  decline  to  approve  the  proposed  changes  to  chapter  iii  of  the  Confession  ofFaith,  for  these,  among  other  reasons:  that  theremoval  of  all  the  sections  but  the  first  wouldimply  obligation  to  modify  many  other  facts  ofour  standards,  and  would  be  generally  regardedas  the  first  and  decisive  step  in  the  way  of  otherand  vital  changes.2.  In  view  of  the  misinterpretations,  to  which,it  is  believed  by  some  of  the  brethren,  sections282  CONTROVERSY  AND3  and  4  and  8  of  chapter  iii  are  liable,  it  be  submitted,  to  the  Assembly  if  it  seems  to  be  needful,  to  formulate  a  statement  as  an  explanatoryor  declaratory  note  disclaiming  any  views,  beliefsor  intentions  in  the  direction  of  these  misinterpretations.3.  That  in  regard  to  the  question  of  infantsalvation  the  General  Assembly  be  asked — if  itjudge  it  right, — to  formulate  a  similar  brief  statement,  to  the  effect  that  our  hope  of  the  salvationof  infants  is  based  not — as  some  rest  it,  on  theirsinlessness,  nor,  as  others  believe,  on  the  virtueof  baptism,  but  on  the  grace  of  God  throughJesus  Christ,  and  the  power  of  the  Divine  Spirit.These  resolutions,  like  the  negative  motion  ofDr.  Shedd,  were  rejected,  and  when  in  the  springa  solid  delegation  pledged  to  revision,  fromwhich  a  large  vote  excluded  my  father,  he  feltthat  his  responsibility  for  the  time  had  ceased.In  the  meantime  the  attack  upon  the  inauguraladdress  of  Dr.  Charles  A.  Briggs,  professor  atUnion  Seminary  had  been  made,  and  the  Assembly  had  vetoed  his  transfer  from  one  chair  to  another.  The  legal  aspects  of  the  powers  of  theAssembly  gave  rise  at  once  to  questions.  At  ameeting  in  June,  1891,  of  the  directors  of  theseminary  my  father  took  the  ground  that  if  theATTEMPTED  PEACEMAKING     283relations  existing  between  the  seminary  and  theAssembly  were  broken,  he  would  have  to  resign.He  came  on  the  board,  he  thought,  after  consultation  with  Dr.  Adams  to  represent  the  OldSchool  sentiment  in  its  new  relation  to  the  workof  the  now  United  Church.If  the  seminary,  he  argued,  ceased  to  be  thework  of  the  United  Church  he  had  no  place  in  itscounsels.  In  a  letter  to  the  New  York  Tribuneof  June  I2th,  1891,  he  put  plainly  his  view  of  thecase,  and  feeling  as  he  did,  and  the  action  of  thedirectors,  taken  equally  conscientiously  havingbroken  the  relation,  he  resigned  from  the  Boardof  Directors.  His  letter  was  as  follows:To  the  Editor  of  the  l^ribune.SIR  : — In  a  report  of  the  last  meeting  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Union  Theological  Seminary,  furnished  I  know  not  bywhom — we  had  no  reporters  present — occurs  the  followingsentence  :  "  It  was  noticed,  however,  that  the  Rev.  Dr.  JohnHall  retired  from  the  meeting  on  the  plea  of  important  engagements  elsewhere  before  a  vote  was  reached."This  is  the  only  reference  to  myself,  and  is  so  liable  to  a  certain  misunderstanding  that  I  feel  bound  to  state  the  facts.I  was  at  the  meeting  from  its  beginning  at  three  o'clock  until  a  quarter  past  five,  when  I  had  to  leave,  as  I  was  under  apromise  to  lecture  to  a  Presbyterian  church  at  White  Plains — a"  labor  of  love,"  at  the  request  of  its  acting  pastor,  and  myvalued  friend.Up  to  the  hour  of  five  o'clock,  the  point  urged  by  severalmembers  (I  do  not  give  names,  because  I  have  only  one  objectin  mind),  was  that  the  seminary,  in  the  arrangement  made  with284  CONTROVERSY  ANDthe  General  Assembly  twenty-one  years  ago,  did  what  was  ruledagainst  in  its  charter,  what  was  illegal,  and  what,  in  law,  forfeited  its  rights  to  its  property,  and  that,  therefore,  the  Assemblyhad  no  power,  and  could  have  none,  to  veto  an  appointment  ofa  professor.  This  plea  was  supported  by  high  legal  authority,and  evidence  was  given  that  some  of  the  directors  apprehendedall  this,  when  the  late  Dr.  Adams  framed  the  overture  made  tothe  General  Assembly,  the  acceptance  of  which  placed  UnionSeminary  in  a  new  relation  to  the  Assembly.To  all  this,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  I  had  nothing  to  say.  Legaltechnicality  is  sometimes  one  thing,  and  equity  quite  another.The  question  before  the  board  respected  our  duty  to  the  Assembly  under  whose  "care  "  we  had  placed  the  institution.  (Seeminutes  of  Assembly  for  1870,  pp.  17,  148.)  I  felt  bound  tosay  that  our  immediate  duty  is  to  go  to  the  Assembly  and  sayin  plain  language  :  "  We  erred  when  we  placed  the  institutionunder  the  care  of  the  General  Assembly,  for  we  were  precludedby  our  charter  from  doing  so.  We  misled  you,  unintentionallyof  course,  and  gave  you  powers  which  we  had  no  right  to  give.For  twenty-one  years  we  have  been  under  your  care,  under  amisapprehension,  for  which  we,  the  directors,  are  responsible,and  are  deeply  sorry."  So  clear  did  this  obligation  seem  tothe  exponent  of  the  defense,  that  he  framed  a  sentence  and  offered  to  put  it  in  his  paper,  embodying  the  acknowledgment.On  this  paper,  though  its  adoption  was  moved  and  seconded,no  vote  was  taken.I  added  that  the  natural  outcome,  from  the  facts  stated,  mustbe  the  separation  of  the  Union  Seminary  from  the  Assembly,after  a  relation  established,  on  our  own  motion,  for  twenty-oneyears,  and  which  made  the  Assembly  responsible  for  our  work,before  the  churches;  and  that  then  it  would  become  a  questionto  some  of  us  whether  we  could,  in  the  circumstances,  remainmembers  of  the  board.  We  invited  the  Assembly  to  take  usunder  its  care.  It  accepted  the  responsibility,  and  it  acts  under  a  sense  of  it.  We  now  say  to  it,  "  Hands  off!  We  had  noright  to  put  ourselves  under  your  care,  as  you,  and  we,  and  theworld  understood  it,  for  these  one  and  twenty  years."ATTEMPTED  PEACEMAKING     285I  mention  these  things  "  to  correct  the  impression  that  thereport  in  the  Tribune  would  suggest,  namely,  that  I  had  noopinion  on  the  matter,  or  that  I  did  not  desire  to  be  committedto  any  side."  My  conviction  I  stated  in  the  plainest  way  thatI  could,  urging  the  obligations  on  us  as  men,  as  Christian  men,as  a  public  Christian  body,  whose  proceedings  now  interest  somuch  the  community.I  have  ventured  to  put  in  quotation  marks  the  point  which  Ihope  will  be  "  noted."  I  have  rarely  to  explain  my  position,or  defend  myself,  but  as  I  am  to  be  out  of  the  country  for  somelittle  time,  I  wish  to  save  critics — higher  or  lower — trouble  inspeculating  upon  my  motives.  Yours  most  truly,New  York,  June  12,  i8gi.J.  HALL.At  a  meeting  of  the  Board  of  Directors  in  November,  1892,  the  resignation  was  accepted  withexpressions  of  "high  appreciation  of  the  serviceyou  have  rendered  to  the  seminary  during  thelong  period  of  your  directorship,  and  their  sincereregret  that  the  pleasurable  associations  of  somany  years  should  for  any  reason  be  terminated."This  action,  as  my  father  often  said,  was  quiteindependent  of  any  action  the  General  Assemblymight  take  in  the  coming  trial  for  heresy  of  Dr.Briggs.  He,  of  course,  disapproved  of  the  inaugural  address.  From  his  standpoint  he  couldnot  be  of  one  mind  with  what  seemed  to  him  adangerous  position.  For  higher  criticism,  as  heunderstood  it,  he  had  no  patience,  believing  that286  CONTROVERSY  ANDall  difficulties  would  ultimately  yield  to  research.  •He  was  quite  outspoken  from  the  beginning  ofthe  controversy  to  the  end  of  it  on  his  own  viewsof  modern  theological  thought  and  the  criticalviews  of  the  origin  of  sacred  scriptures.  LikeDr.  McCosh  he  thought  Dr.  Briggs  wrong  inmany  of  his  critical  positions,  and  in  public  andprivate  always  honestly  expressed  those  views.At  the  same  time  he  did  not  hope  much  froma  trial  for  heresy,  and  exerted  himself  to  the  utmost  to  avoid  that  conclusion.  This  gave  deadlyoffense  to  some  of  those  most  interested,  towhom  the  trial  for  heresy  was  a  mere  means  forwarding  off  revision,  and  the  maintaining  thesupremacy  of  a  certain  type  of  thought  in  thechurch.  This  was  what  made  my  father's  position  difficult  in  the  extreme.  He  agreed  heartilyin  the  desire  to  guard  against  any  radical  revision,he  did  not  and  could  not  enthusiastically  share  inthe  heresy  trial  as  a  means  to  that  end.He  had  himself  no  doubt  that  Dr.  Briggs  wastechnically  outside  the  confessional  limits,  but  hehad  no  desire  to  really  exclude  him,  if  only  hewas  satisfied  that  in  the  main  evangelical  essentialshe  was  in  harmony  with  the  mass  of  believers.Many  thought  that  had  my  father  gone  to  theAssembly  in  1891  instead  of  sending  his  alternateATTEMPTED  PEACEMAKING     287he  might  have  avoided  the  subsequent  trouble.But  in  the  first  place  his  election  was  an  entiresurprise  to  him,  and  he  had  made  arrangementshe  could  not  with  honor  break;  and  in  the  secondplace  notice  had  been  served  upon  him  by  hisnatural  friends  and  allies  on  the  conservative  sidethat  they  would  tolerate  no  mediation.  He  felt,and  in  view  of  past  events,  he  undoubtedlyrightly  felt,  that  he  could  not  carry  the  Assemblyfor  the  only  policy  he  thought  just  and  sensible,and  that  by  the  action  of  the  previous  year  hehad  been  relieved  of  responsibility  in  the  matter.Never  had  my  father  the  least  doubt  as  to  themain  issue  of  the  inerrancy  of  Holy  Scripture  inall  the  essentials  of  its  history,  nor  did  he  attachimportance  to  the  difficulties  raised  by  modern  criticism.  In  large  measure,  in  fact,  they  laybeyond  the  sphere  of  his  particular  interest.  Yetwhile  for  himself  this  was  true,  and  he  wouldhave  personally  assented  to  any  definition  of  inspiration  however  rigorous  on  these  points,  henevertheless  came  into  contact  with  men  of  whoseChristian  experience  and  whose  reverent  scholarship  he  had  no  doubts  whatsoever,  who  could  notaccept  theories  that  seemed  to  him  rational  andeven  obvious.  The  attitude  of  Scotch  scholarship  had  in  this  matter  the  greatest  weight  with288  CONTROVERSY  ANDhim.1  Naturally  traditions  led  him  to  look  ratherto  Scotland  than  to  either  America  or  Germanyfor  the  intellectual  stimulus  every  thinking  manneeds.  And  in  Scotland  he  saw  theologian  aftertheologian  pass  from  the  extreme  position  to  thelooser,  as  he  counted  it,  definition  of  inspiration.Moreover  the  traditions  of  the  struggle  for  orthodoxy  in  Ireland  excluded  heresy-trials.  Dr.  Cookehad  resolutely  refused  to  commit  the  Synod  tothis  step.  "  Guard,"  he  advised,  "the  entrance  tothe  church,  but  suffer  all  those  now  within  to  re-1  It  may  be  permitted  here  for  the  present  writer  to  add  apersonal  word.  It  was  not  unnaturally  argued  that  the  positiontaken  by  the  writer  affected  my  father's  conduct  in  this  struggle.  This  was  not  the  case.  From  the  outset  there  was  a  fullunderstanding  between  father  and  son  ;  and  although  undoubtedly  it  was  painful  that  convictions  differed,  in  letter  afterletter  assurances  were  given  of  the  utmost  confidence  in  thesincerity  of  those  convictions,  and  unfaithfulness  to  themwould  have  given  my  father  deepest  pain.  When  the  time  tospeak  out  seemed  to  the  writer  to  have  come,  an  opening  inanother  sister  church  offered  itself.  This  seemed  a  ready  solution  of  the  difficulty,  but  my  father  resolutely  refused  to  havethat  step  taken,  and  urged  retention  of  my  connection  with  thePresbyterian  Church,  only  enjoining  gentleness  and  moderationin  the  maintaining  of  my  convictions.  The  slightest  hint  frommy  father  that  he  doubted  my  rights  within  the  lines  of  thePresbyterial  communion,  or  the  least  indication  that  he  regarded  it  as  a  hindrance  to  his  own  free  action  would  at  anystage  of  the  controversy  been  sufficient  to  have  led  me  quietlyto  withdraw.  All  such  steps  my  father  steadily  and  continuously  opposed.ATTEMPTED  PEACEMAKING      289main  in  peace."  The  extreme  "  Arian"  party,  asit  was  called  withdrew  to  a  remonstrant  Synod,but  the  clerk  of  the  Assembly,  after  publiclyavowing  his  Unitarian  position,  was  not  even  disturbed  in  his  holding  the  clerkship.Moreover  the  methods  of  the  extreme  partywere  distasteful  to  him.  He  felt  somewhat  asDr.  McCosh  is  said  to  have  done,  that  Dr.  Briggsshould  be  answered  and  refuted,  but  that  aheresy-trial  was  no  answer.  There  was  no  attempt  to  "shirk"  issues,  as  one  of  the  extremeparty  charged  him  with  doing.  He  separatedhimself  at  once  from  Union  Seminary  when  heconsidered  his  own  position  compromised,  hevigorously  opposed  revision  of  the  standards,  andhis  rejected  resolution  would  have  been  agreeableto  Dr.  Shedd  or  any  of  the  really  responsible  conservatives,  he  attempted  to  avoid  a  heresy-trialand  stood  manfully  for  peace,  and  althoughnever  wavering  in  his  own  personal  convictions,he  was  willing  to  put  up  with  "weaker  brethren"  if  only  Christ  was  preached.  The  so-called"liberal"  men  knew  and  respected  his  position,the  taunts  and  insults  came  from  a  few  whoseintemperate  words  and  actions  could  not  shakemy  father's  faith  in  the  conservative  position,  butin  whose  methods  he  could  have  little  part  and290  CONTROVERSY  ANDin  whose  aims  he  did  not  always  have  confidence.In  this  spirit  he  also  refused  to  have  the  HomeBoard  made  a  partisan  agency  by  which  thechurch  could  be  "  purged,"  as  one  correspondenturged  upon  him,  from  those  who  refused  theshibboleths  of  the  extreme  faction.  Instinctivelyhe  felt  that  Protestantism  rested  upon  the  harmony  of  reason  and  faith,  and  his  confidence  wasfirm  that  the  matter  had  only  to  be  discussedrightly,  and  that  faith  would  gain  the  victory.As  one,  a  member  of  his  session,  and  himself  anoutspoken  partisan  wrote  to  him:  "I  have  noticed  the  impertinent  reference  to  your  privateaffairs  in  the  Tribune  and  your  answer  to  it.  Iwish  to  say  that  your  course  in  keeping  freefrom  the  strife  and  contentions,  clamors  and  evilspeakings  on  both  sides  in  the  Briggs  controversy,  I  consider  eminently  wise  and  proper.You  are  not  called  upon  to  be  a  partisan  oneither  side  if  you  prefer  peace  and  brotherlykindness;  and  I  am  sure  your  consistent  coursewill  approve  itself  to  all  your  people,  and  to  allconsiderate  men."He,  moreover  never  avoided  any  opportunityof  expressing  himself,  publicly  and  privately,  ashis  correspondence  and  printed  documents  show,ATTEMPTED  PEACEMAKING     291on  the  issues  of  the  case.  In  the  heat  and  strifehowever  his  counsels  of  patience  and  moderationwere  unheeded,  perhaps  a  calmer  review  than  isnow  possible  of  the  whole  history  will  establishthe  wisdom  of  his  course.  To  have,  however,acted  otherwise  than  he  did  would  have  been  acomplete  departure  from  the  traditions  of  a  lifetime,  and  a  change  in  the  entire  habit  of  his  mindand  heart.  It  was  therefore  to  him  that  youngermen  all  over  the  country  wrote  asking  adviceafter  the  condemnation  of  Dr.  Briggs  at  Washington  as  to  what  they  should  do  under  the  circumstances,  and  to  them  the  answer  was  uniformly  "stay  where  God  has  put  you,  if  you  canhonestly  preach  Christ  as  the  Saviour  of  theworld,  and  work  in  harmony  with  your  brethrenin  the  Lord."  He  felt  deeply  sorry  that  so  manyhad  accepted,  what  seemed  to  him,  a  fallaciousand  imperfect  conception  of  inspiration,  and  thatso  wide-spread  a  falling  off  from  traditionalopinion  was  manifest;  he  thought  greater  careshould  be  exercised  by  presbyteries  in  the  admitting  of  men  to  the  ministry;  but  he  saw  noremedy  in  heresy-trials,  and  did  confidantly  believe  that  truth  would  assert  herself  in  her  ownway.His  course  was  watched  and  approved  by292  CONTROVERSYthoughtful  friends  both  conservative  and  advanced  on  the  other  side  of  the  Atlantic,  and  hefelt  after  the  first  heats  of  the  controversy  wereover  that  calm  discussion  and  "more  scholarship"  would  relieve  the  situation.  What  he  regarded  as  essential  he  once  formulated  in  a  paperon  church  unity.  He  wrote:"If  I  were  asked,  what  is  most  promotive  oftrue  church  unity,  I  could  make  but  one  reply.Let  there  be  the  preaching  and  teaching  of  theinspired  word.  Let  the  Saviour  be  held  up  asprophet,  priest  and  king,  through  whom  aloneaccess  is  had  to  the  Father;  as  He  is  the  ChiefShepherd  and  Bishop  of  souls  let  His  authoritybe  supreme  in  the  Church.

The  calm  self-possession  that  marked  him  in  the  pulpit  and  on  theplatform  sprang  from  his  habit  of  constant  self-control  and  from  his  profound  sense  that  he  hada  message  which  was  not  simply  his  own.It  was  hard  to  persuade  him  in  his  student  daysthat  he  was  the  right  one  to  go  as  representinghis  class  to  Connaught.  A  proud  shyness  markedhim  as  a  student,  and  is  noticed  both  in  his  correspondence  and  his  diary  of  those  days.  Theprominence  he  attained  to  in  Ireland  was  thrustupon  him.  He  took  the  first  outside  honor  thatwas  offered  him — the  Queen's  commissionershipof  education  in  Ireland— because  it  gave  him  afield  of  congenial  usefulness,  and  because  it  represented  a  principle,  and  not  for  the  honor  it295296       SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSbrought  with  it.  While  highly  self-respectingand  free  from  artificial  humility,  he  genuinelyshrank  from  publicity  and  all  mere  notoriety.His  old  and  warmly  attached  friend — Mr.George  H.  Stuart — always  a  little  amused  andamazed  him  by  an  utter  freedom  in  public,  andby  the  way  he  enjoyed  crowds,  enthusiasm,  noiseand  demonstration.  These  were  not  congenialto  my  father.  He  loved  order,  and  his  tasteswere  sober  and  quiet.  His  reserve  made  hisintimate  friendships  very  few,  yet  he  thoroughlyenjoyed  the  fellowship  of  his  brethren.  He  waswarmly  interested  in  the  rather  distinguishedgroup  of  men  with  whom  he  worked  in  Dublin,and  who  one  by  one  made  marks  in  life  for  themselves  in  various  directions.  He  kept  alive  thememories  of  the  little  circle  of  student  days,already  mentioned.  When  he  came  to  NewYork  he  was  at  once  welcomed  into  a  well-known  ministerial  circle,  whose  associations  hetreasured  until  his  death.  Another  gathering  always  deeply  interested  him,  namely  the  ministerial  meeting  on  Mondays.  He  never  missed  itunless  hindered  by  important  duties  or  some  circumstance  he  could  not  control.One  of  the  keen  pleasures  of  his  life  was  therecurring    conventions    of    the    Scotch-Irish    inSUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS        297America.  He  looked  forward  with  what  was  forhim  eager  pleasure  to  these  gatherings.  He  generally  shared  this  pleasure  with  Mr.  Robert  Bon-ner  who  took  an  active  interest  in  the  life  of  thesociety.  It  was  my  father's  lot  to  often  preachbefore  the  convention,  and  nowhere  did  he  everfeel  more  completely  in  touch  with  his  audiencethan  when  taking  part  in  the  "old-time  meeting"which  formed  a  part  of  the  convention's  exercises.  The  first  degree  was  received  by  myfather  while  still  in  Ireland  from  the  Universityof  Washington  and  Jefferson,  1865,  and  after  hecame  to  America  various  degrees  were  givenhim.  In  1886,  Columbia  University  bestowed  onhim  the  degree  of  LL.  D.,  but  he  especially  accepted  with  satisfaction  the  degree  of  LL.  D.from  Trinity  College,  Dublin,  which  was  givenin  1891,  but  received  personally  by  him  in  Dublinin  1893.  Trinity  College  being  wholly  under  thecontrol  of  the  Episcopal  church  has  not  oftenthus  honored  Irish  Presbyterians.  A  notable  exception  was  the  case  of  Dr.  Henry  Cooke,  whohowever  defended  the  establishment,  whereasmy  father  was  known  to  be  an  open  antagonistof  that  policy.  The  degree  was  conferred  in"recognition  of  your  distinguished  merits,"  andwas  understood  to  be  a  special  recognition  not298        SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSonly  of  the  successful  career  in  New  York,  butof  past  services  in  connection  with  Irish  affairs.The  conferring  of  this  degree  not  only  greatlygratified  my  father,  but  he  spent  a  most  delightful  few  days  in  Dublin  among  his  old  co-workers,  on  the  Board  of  Education,  Presbyterian,Episcopalian  and  Roman  Catholic.It  was  part  of  the  joy  of  his  service  in  NewYork  that  he  could  be  of  use  to  many  branchesof  the  Church  of  Christ.  Probably  no  voice  hasbeen  so  much  heard  in  so  many  different  denominations  as  that  of  my  father.  On  Sabbath  evenings  he  generally  preached  or  spoke  somewhereout  of  his  own  church.  He  delighted  to  be  ofuse  to  churches  and  brethren  less  favored  by  circumstances  than  he  and  his  charge  were.In  the  year  1875  he  delivered  the  Yale  lectures,already  mentioned,  and  from  that  on  almost  everyyear  he  spoke  to  the  various  classes  of  the  YaleTheological  Seminary.  Close  and  warm  friendships  sprang  up  in  the  Congregational  Churchas  a  result  of  these  visits  and  he  took  a  deep  interest  in  many  of  the  men  whom  he  came  toknow  in  the  theological  classes  he  thus  addressed.The  year  1896  is  marked  in  his  diary  as  a  yearof  special  blessing  and  peace.  The  health  of  hisSUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS        299wife  and  a  son  about  whom  he  had  had  anxietyhad  so  much  improved  that  he  had  practically  noconcern  in  this  regard.  The  work  of  the  churchseemed  to  be  going  on  with  every  evidence  ofprosperity  and  peace.  In  the  summer  of  thatyear  he  went  as  a  delegate  to  the  EvangelicalAlliance,  which  met  in  London  from  June  3Othto  July  4th.  In  the  Alliance  he  had  always  takena  deep  interest.  It  seemed  to  him  to  be  the  onlypractical  Christian  unity  possible,  at  present,  obtainable.  He  rejoiced  always  in  its  activity  andmore  than  once  stood  up  to  defend  it  againstthose  who  saw  in  it  nothing  but  a  sentiment.He  felt  that  denomination  differences  had  ameaning,  but  that  there  was  a  spirit  deeper  andmore  unifying  than  the  external  bond.  He  oncewrote:"  Like  many  other  words  and  phrases  in  commonuse.  'Church  unity'  needs  to  be  defined.  Inthe  minds  of  some  it  means:  'Let  the  denominations  or  sects  come  and  join  us,  just  as  we  are;and  so  let  us  have  unity.'  With  others  itmeans:  'Let  us  work  together,  not  against  oneanother  but  against  ignorance,  worldliness  andvice.'  This  is  the  idea  represented  in  theEvangelical  Alliance,  and  the  idea  which  has  mysympathy.  As  an  illustration  of  its  working  I300       SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWScan  exchange  pulpits  with  Baptist,  Congregational,  Methodist,  and  other  brethren,  andshow  that  while  we  have  our  several  forms  ofmachinery  and  distinctive  features  in  our  Church-life,  yet  we  have  the  same  message  in  substance  todeliver  to  the  people.  It  is  desirable  that  thisform  of  unity  should  be  realized  more  and  more,so  that  economy  might  be  practiced,  and  if  amodest  village  has  a  couple  of  congregationsequal  to  the  wants  of  the  place  other  two  mightnot  press  in  and  at  the  cost  of  Missionary  Boardspush  competitive  effort."That  autumn's  work  showed  an  extraordinaryamount  of  activity.  Before  Christmas  the  visiting  was  well  in  hand,  and  the  year  closedin  the  journal  with  a  characteristic  prayer  ofthanksgiving.  The  peace  and  quiet  activity  ofthe  year  was  however,  not  carried  on  into  thefollowing  one  1897.  The  first  shadow  was  thesudden  and  severe  illness  of  the  present  writer,and  at  a  certain  stage  hope  of  recovery  was  surrendered  and  my  father  was  called  to  Chicago,where  my  charge  then  was.  For  some  days  ofanxiety  and  suspense  he  remained  haunting  thebedroom  for  some  gleam  of  hope.  He  preachedon  Sunday  morning  in  the  vacant  pulpit,  andcame  home  to  find  marks  of  improvement;  butSUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS       301the  rejoicing  was  cut  short  by  the  dreadful  newsof  the  death  in  far-off  Santa  Barbara  of  the  thirdson  Richard,  whose  career  as  a  surgeon  had  beenbrilliant,  but  who  had  been  banished  by  ill-healthto  California.In  suspense  still  about  me,  and  burdened  by  thedreadfully  unexpected  news  from  California,  hehurried  home  to  be  of  comfort  to  the  sorrowingmother.  And  in  the  same  spring  a  dearly  lovedgrandchild  was  stricken  down,  and  hope  andhopelessness,  and  long  periods  of  suspense  werebrought  to  sad  termination;  and  deeply  did  myfather  feel  the  sorrow  of  his  dearly  loveddaughter.In  the  preoccupation  caused  by  these  sorrowsupon  sorrows  there  was  brought  to  his  attentionthe  matter  of  an  assistantship.  This  question  hadoften  come  up ;  that  my  father  was  overworked  noone  doubted;  but  that  any  one  could  do  much  tohelp  him  was  seriously  questioned.  He  had  himself  a  great  dislike  of  repeating  the  experiment  ofDublin,  but  the  chief  difficulty  was  that  the  moment  an  assistantship  was  planned,  wires  werepulled  and  arrangements  made  to  force  upon  thechurch  men  whom  he  considered  unwise  choices.So  vigorous  were  these  efforts  that  again  andagain  the  only  way  out  of  the  difficulty  seemed302       SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSto  be  the  postponing  of  any  choice.  Aftercalmly  viewing  the  evidence  it  is  hard  to  resistthe  impression  that  some  of  the  bitterness  thatclouded  these  last  days  was  the  direct  result  ofthese  disappointed  plans.  The  requirements  ofthe  place  of  assistant  or  co-pastor  to  one  who  hadfor  thirty  years  borne  such  a  burden  alone  wereindeed  many.  It  was  needful  that  in  theologicalopinion  such  an  one  should  share  the  main  intellectual  outlines  of  the  pulpit  instruction.  Myfather  had  many  feelings,  which  he  himselfwould  not  have  called  more  than  prejudices,  butwhich  he  cherished,  and  to  have  put  them  asidewould  have  lost  him  much  discomfort.  He  hadno  "principle,"  for  instance,  in  the  matter  ofChurch  music,  but  he  was  deeply  prejudicedagainst  the  ordinary  Church  choir.  He  hadsuffered  from  it  once,  and  disliked  it.  Whatother  Churches  did  was  a  matter  of  almost  indifference  to  him;  he  sometimes  even  enjoyed  ahearty  chorus  or  a  fine  rendering  of  some  simplechurch  music  in  churches  where  he  was  a  visitor,but  for  himself  he  disliked  anything  save  congregational  singing  where  he  was  responsible  forthe  service.To  the  present  writer  he  often  said  that  theembarrassments   of   an   assistantship   lay    muchSUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS        303along  this  line  of  putting  a  yoke  upon  a  youngerman,  such  as  he  had  himself  felt  in  his  earlierdays  to  be  irksome,  and  which  he  yet  felt  wouldbe  necessary  if  the  arrangement  should  really  succeed.  Rightly  or  wrongly  he  now  felt  that  somewho  were  not  wholly  loyal  and  friendly  to  himwere  pushing  this  matter  with  selfish  purpose  inview.In  about  the  year  1889  there  had  come  a  youngand  evidently  highly  gifted  converted  Jew,  Hermann  Warszawiak  by  name  to  New  York  withstrong  letters  of  commendation,  and  with  personalletters  to  my  father.  After  some  signs  of  powerin  preaching  to  his  countrymen  he  was  employedby  the  New  York  City  Mission,  and  carried  onhis  work  with  seeming  success.  Letters  thencame  to  New  York  of  a  confidential  nature  to  myfather  warning  him  that  the  young  Jew  would  beattacked,  and  urging  him  to  protect  the  missionary  against  what  was  said  to  be  a  conspiracy.Shortly  after  this  the  connection  between  Mr.Hermann  Warszawiak  and  the  New  York  CityMission  was  severed,  and  a  committee  undertook  to  manage  the  work  he  had  begun.  Thisarrangement  did  not  succeed,  in  part  because  thecommittee  did  not  have  time  to  attend  to  thematter,  in  part  because  perhaps  Mr.  Warszawiak3o4       SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSwas  not  easily  managed.  The  work  had  myfather's  full  endorsement.  He  trusted  Mr.  War-szawiak  fully,  although  even  then  strongly  urging  him  to  carefulness  in  money  matters.Attacks  began  now  to  be  made  upon  the  youngmissionary's  character.  These  were  of  a  vagueand  general  nature.  At  once  my  father  investigated  those  that  were  sufficiently  definite  to  beinvestigated,  and  in  one  case  at  least  the  chargewas  at  once  proved  to  be  a  gross  and  clumsyslander.  Mr.  Warszawiak  was  responsible  tothe  session  of  the  Fifth  Avenue  PresbyterianChurch,  and  desired  to  be  taken  under  the  careof  presbytery.  Here  objection  was  made  andone  accuser  produced  documents  which  he  allegedcontained  conclusive  evidence  of  bad  character.This  allegation  is  now  known  to  have  been  amisstatement,  for  all  the  charges  brought  againstMr.  Warszawiak  were  subsequent  to  that  meeting,  and  no  evidence  can  yet  be  called  "  conclusive  "  of  anything.  l  Having  been  warned  ofsuch  attacks  it  was  no  wonder  that  my  fatherconstantly  demanded  evidence,  and  having  in  atleast  three  several  instances  proved  conclusively1  The  following  is  the  text  of  the  judicial  finding  at  the  lastEcclesiastical  trial.  To  the  Moderator  and  Session  of  the  FifthAvenue  Presbyterian  Church,SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS       305that  charges  made  were  base  slanders,  it  was  theleast  that  he  could  do  to  suspend  judgment.Sitting  as  a  Judicial  Court  of  Jesus  Christ,In  the  Matter  of  the  charges  preferred— against —Hermann  Warszawiak,a  member  of  the  Church.The  undersigned,  the  committee  appointed  in  the  abovematter  to  report  what  course  of  proceedings  should  be  takentherein,  beg  leave  to  report,  that  they  have  considered  the  proceedings  heretofore  had  in  this  matter  before  this  session,  ThePresbytery  of  New  York,  the  Synod  of  New  York  and  the  General  Assembly,  and  have  examined  the  charges  and  specifications  containing  the  names  of  proposed  witnesses  in  their  support  ;  and  also  the  two  petitions  of  the  accused  dated  respectively  June  28th,  1898,  and  October  25th,  1899,  asking  that  anew  trial  be  issued.The  charges  are  that  the  accused  on  certain  dates  during  themonths  of  January,  February  and  March,  1897,  won  and  lostmoney  by  gambling  in  a  public  gambling-house  and  pool-room.All  of  the  witnesses  named  in  the  specifications  in  support  ofthe  charges  (except  some  who  were  called  on  the  former  trialonly  to  prove  formal  matters  which  did  not  touch  the  charges  ofgambling)  are  professional  detectives  ;  none  of  them  are  members  of  the  Church  (except  possibly  one)  and  some  of  them  arenot  even  adherents  to  any  form  of  Christian  faith.The  evidence  of  such  witnesses  alone,  even  supposing  thatthey  should  swear  to  the  truth  of  the  charges,  would  not  be  considered  by  many  fair-minded  Christian  members  of  our  Churchas  conclusive  of  the  guilt  of  a  fellow-member,  when  he  deniedon  oath  the  truth  of  their  evidence,  as  was  the  case  in  theformer  trial.There  is  no  suggestion  or  rumor  that  the  accused  has  since306       SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSAt  last  the  trial  took  place.  Of  that  so-calledtrial  the  less  that  is  said  the  better.

Inthe  finding  my  father  was  in  a  minority.  Hisverdict  however,  of  "not  proven"  was  sustainedby  the  New  York  Synod  in  1898  after  my  fatherhad  passed  from  the  field  of  conflict.  That  actionwas,  "  It  appears  that  injustice  may  have  beendone  Warszawiak  in  the  original  trial  before  thesession  in  not  appointing  him  any  counsel,  in  notbers  of  the  Church  (except  possibly  one)  and  some  of  them  arenot  even  adherents  of  any  Christian  faith,  and  therefore  are  notsuch  that  unqualified  credence  should  be  given  them  ;AND  WHEREAS,  The  former  trial  and  subsequent  proceedingstherein  have  been  a  source  of  continual  irritation  and  a  hindrance  to  kindly  brotherly  Christian  feeling  in  the  Church,  anda  detriment  to  the  advancement  of  Christ's  Kingdom  in  ourmidst  ;Therefore,  Resolved,  That  it  is  the  judgment  of  this  court  thata  retrial  of  Hermann  Warszawiak  upon  the  charges  heretoforepreferred  against  him  would  not  result  in  any  good  or  to  thepurity  of  the  Church,  but  on  the  contrary,  would  disturb  thepeace  and  unity  of  our  congregation  and  of  the  church  ;Therefore,  Resolved,  That  the  said  charges  be,  and  they  herebyare,  dismissed,  and  that  he,  Hermann  Warszawiak,  be  andhereby  is  restored  to  the  communion  of  this  church  as  a  member  in  good  and  regular  standing.All  of  which  is  respectfully  submitted.Dated,  this  3d  day  of  November,  1899.This  action  became  the  action  of  the  Court,  though  notunanimously.3o8       SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSgranting  him  access  to  the  records,  in  totallystriking  out  his  testimony  for  contumacy,  and  inallowing  undue  cross-examination  into  financialmatters  not  included  in  the  original  charges. "  Theappeal  was  therefore  sustained,  and  the  case  wasordered  to  be  retried.1  Rightly  or  wrongly  my1  The  full  text  of  the  Synod's  decision  is  as  follows  : —The  appeal  of  Hermann  Warszawiak  from  the  judgment  ofthe  Presbytery  of  New  York,  sustaining  the  finding  and  judgment  of  the  session  of  the  Fifth  Avenue  Church  of  the  City  ofNew  York,  having  been  found  in  order  by  the  Synod  of  NewYork,  on  the  igth  day  of  October,  1898,  and  a  Judicial  Commission  having  been  appointed  to  hear  and  determine  the  issuesraised  by  such  appeal ;  and  such  commission  of  Synod  havingmet  on  the  igth,  2Oth  and  2ist  days  of  October,  1898,  andproceeding  in  due  form  according  to  the  Book  of  Discipline,§  99 :  the  judgment,  the  notice  of  appeal,  the  appeal  and  thespecifications  of  the  errors  alleged  having  been  read,  togetherwith  so  much  of  the  records  of  the  case  as  was  admitted  bymutual  consent  of  the  parties,  the  appellant  and  respondenthaving  been  heard  at  length,  the  members  of  the  judicatory  appealed  from  having  been  heard,  and  also  the  members  of  thecommission  ;  the  vote  having  been  taken  on  each  specificationof  error  alleged."  The  said  Judicial  Commission,  after  voting  upon  each  exception  specified  in  the  notice  of  appeal,  does  determine  andadjudge  that  the  Presbytery  of  New  York  did  err  in  hearingand  adjudging  the  appeal  of  Hermann  Warszawiak  from  thesession  of  the  Fifth  Avenue  Church  of  the  City  of  New  York."  It  finds  the  lower  court  in  error  in  irregularities  in  the  proceedings  :  I  spec.  7  and  12,  in  refusal  to  entertain  and  considercomplaints  in  the  form  of  objections  and  exceptions.  II  spec.4,  in  refusal  of  reasonable  indulgence.  Ill  spec.  4,  5,  6  and12,  in  hastening  to  a  decision.  V  spec.  3  and  5,  and  therefore  itSUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS       309father  was  again  convinced  that  the  charges  ofgambling  were  trumped  up,  and  certainly  nocourt  of  civil  justice  would  admit  the  evidencethat  was  produced.  He  was  staggered  in  his  faithin  Mr.  Warszawiak  for  a  little  time  by  an  allegedconfession  of  Mr.  Warszawiak's  to  a  prominentcitizen  of  New  York.  But  my  father  was  a  goodlistener,  and  was  of  a  curiously  skeptical  mind  inevery-day  affairs.  He  had  two  interviews  withthe  gentleman  and  convinced  himself  that  thestatements  made  were,  to  say  the  least,  inaccurate.  He  marked  two  such  glaring  inaccuraciesin  the  account  given  him  that  he  lost  faith  in  hissustains  the  appeal,  and  reverses  the  judgment  of  the  Presbytery  of  New  York."  Further,  it  seems  to  the  commission  that  injustice  may  havebeen  done  Mr  .Warszawiak,  in  the  original  trial  before  the  session,in  not  appointing  him  any  counsel,  in  not  granting  him  access  tothe  records,  in  totally  striking  out  his  testimony  for  contumacy,and  in  allowing  undue  cross-examination  into  financial  mattersnot  included  in  the  original  charges."  It  is  therefore  the  order  of  this  Synod  that  the  appeal  besustained,  and  that  the  Presbytery  of  New  York  be  instructedto  remand  this  case  to  the  session  of  the  Fifth  Avenue  Churchwith  instructions  to  retry  Hermann  Warszawiak  upon  amendedcharges,  including  the  misuse  of  moneys  contributed  for  missionary  purposes."On  appeal  the  Assembly  of  1899  sustained  the  Synod  saveonly  striking  out  the  instructions  "  to  retry  on  amendedcharges  "  on  the  ground  that  original  jurisdiction  pertained  onlyto  the  session.310        SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSinformant's  powers  of  objective  observation.  Atthe  same  time  he  felt  that  he  could  not  endorsethe  work  to  others  until  the  matter  was  clearedup.  This  was  previous  to  the  trial  before  thesession.  At  that  trial  he  was  still  fartherconvinced  that  whatever  might  be  the  truth,no  conclusive  proof  of  guilt  was  in  thepossession  of  those  prosecuting  Mr.  War-szawiak.The  matter  was  still  farther  complicated  by  thesomewhat  intemperate  defense  of  Mr.  Warsza-wiak  by  a  well-known  evangelist  from  England,who  did  not  confine  himself  to  the  facts  of  thecase  but  impugned  in  an  unwise  manner  themotives  and  lives  of  those  who,  no  doubt,  sincerely  distrusted  Mr.  Warszawiak.  For  that  attack  my  father  felt  sincerely  sorry,  but  he  had  noreason  for  interfering,  as  he  was  neither  consultedby  nor  even  well-known  to  the  author  of  thatattack.My  father,  it  is  true,  had  lost  confidence  in  thecalm  impartiality  of  some  of  the  chief  assailants;and  the  outrageous  misstatements  of  one  of  themhad  completely  undermined  my  father's  previousreliance  upon  his  fairness  and  good  judgment;at  the  same  time  his  one  steady  demand  was  evidence  and  facts.  And  these  were  never  forth-SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS       311coming.  The  last  authentic  judgment1  of  myfather  was  written  from  Buxton,  England,  in  June,1898,  when  in  a  letter  to  the  Tribune  of  NewYork,  he  said: —To  the  Editor  of  the  Tribune.SIR: — May  I  ask  the  insertion  of  this  brief  statementon  a  matter  concerning  which  more  letters  have  come  to  methan  I  have  been  able  to  answer.Mr.  Warszawiak  came  to  New  York  bringing  from  Europethe  strongest  letters  of  commendation,  including  one  of  introduction  to  myself  from  a  prominent  minister  in  Edinburgh.He  was  taken,  after  a  little,  into  connection  with  the  NewYork  City  Mission,  and  for  a  considerable  time  had  strong  indorsement  from  its  officers.  After  separating  from  it,  and  alsofrom  a  committee  that  took  up  his  work,  he  went  on  with  it  independently  and  with  apparent  usefulness.1  The  stages  of  the  case  were  as  follows  :  About  1889  Warszawiak  came  to  New  York.  Employed  by  New  York  CityMissions.  United  with  Fifth  Avenue  Presbyterian  Church  in1890.  Honorably  discharged  by  City  Missions  in  1894-5.Carried  on  his  work  independently.  Applied  for  admission  toNew  York  Presbytery,  1897.  Accused  and  convicted  beforeSession  of  Church,  1897.  Appealed  to  presbytery  and  trial  before  a  commission,  1897.  Appealed  to  Synod  October,  1898.Appeal  sustained,  but  new  charges  ordered.  Appealed  to  Assembly  1899  against  that  order.  Sustained.  Synod  refused  toobey  Assembly  and  asked  for  instruction.  Warszawiak  askedfor  new  trial  before  Church  Session.  Trial  had  before  Sessionand  case  dismissed  1899.  Appeal  and  complaint  lodged  againstaction  of  Session  in  dismissing.  Presbytery  found  appeal  andcomplaint  "not  in  order."  General  Assembly  at  St.  Louis  dismissed  whole  matter.  Mr.  Warszawiak  therefore  to-day  in  goodstanding  in  Fifth  Avenue  Presbyterian  Church.312       SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSThe  charge  against  him,  which  was  referred  to  the  Presbytery  of  the  Fifth  Avenue  Church  Session,  namely,  gambling,was  held  by  a  minority  of  the  session  to  be  "  not  proven."  Myopinion  was  with  the  minority.  The  matter  of  his  use  ofmoney,  though  incidentally  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  session,had  not  been  referred  to  it.Mr.  Warszawiak  went  to  Europe,  it  was  understood,  to  arrange  money  matters.  Since  that  I  have  had  no  communication  from  him,  and  accordingly  I  am  not  in  a  condition  to  continue  indorsement  of  his  plans  for  pecuniary  aid.  It  appears  tobe  my  duty,  therefore,  to  say  that —  whatever  the  state  of  thecase  may  be,  and  whatever  the  issue  of  his  appeal  to  the  churchcourts — it  is  impossible  for  me  to  answer  intelligently  the  question  as  to  his  financial  management.Buxton,  England,  June  77,  1898.JOHN  HAI.L.To  many  my  father  seemed  simply  obstinate,not  knowing  how  many  obscure  motives  on  thepart  of  those  prosecuting  the  case  were  quiteobvious  to  him.  The  young  Jew  was  really  veryhelpless  and  friendless.  My  father  had  moreovera  keen  sense  of  justice.  He  felt  that  in  accordance  with  Anglo-Saxon  tradition  he  must  standby  an  accused  man  and  treat  him  as  innocentuntil  he  should  be  proved  guilty.  All  the  old-fashioned  chivalry  of  his  nature  was  appealed  to,and  he  demanded  that  whether  Mr.  Warszawiakwere  guilty  or  not,  he  at  least  should  have  a  fairtrial  and  his  rightful  opportunity  to  establish  hisinnocence  if  possible.SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS       313This  unhappy  incident  produced  many  alienations.  Moreover  the  conditions  in  the  churchhad  much  changed.  Nearly  all  the  old  advisersof  my  father,  who  had  welcomed  him  to  thecountry  had  passed  away.  The  restlessness  ofAmerican  life  knows  little  of  sentiment,  and  tiesare  easily  broken.  There  had  been  discontenton  the  part  of  some  of  those  with  whom  myfather  was  working  with  his  policy  in  many  directions.  Some  disliked  his  course  in  the  theological  controversy  of  the  past  years;  nothingbut  a  bitter  partisanship,  of  which  he  was  incapable,  would  have  satisfied  them.Others  desired  changes  that  could  not  easily  bemade  while  his  "prejudices"  existed  againstwhat  they  wished.  Some  of  the  younger  generation  did  not,  perhaps,  value  his  careful  pastoralwork  as  highly  as  an  older  generation  had  done.When  he  took  the  part  of  Warszawiak  with  theminority  of  four,  it  became  evident  that  to  someextent  the  majority  of  the  session  was  on  trial.As  early  as  July,  1897,  a  rather  harsh  coarse  letterfrom  a  member  of  the  session  informed  myfather  of  a  private  meeting  called  to  consider  displacing  him.  This  was  a  fearful  shock  to  a  manbowed  with  sorrow,  and  was  perhaps  all  themore  disastrous  in  its  effects  that  it  was  borne3i4       SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSalone  and  in  silence.  On  the  return  in  theautumn  of  that  year  another  such  private  meeting  seems  to  have  been  held,  and  my  father  wasgiven  to  understand  that  it  acted  in  the  sense  ofthe  greater  part  of  the  congregation.  He  acquiesced.  A  special  committee  of  session  wasappointed  to  consider  the  whole  matter,  and  hewas  made  a  member  of  it.  Of  course  that  membership  was  purely  pro  forma,  he  simply  assentedto  whatever  was  done  as  the  minute  introducedand  carried  shows.  That  minute  was  as  follows:WHEREAS  our  pastor,  Rev.  John  Hall,  D.  D.,LL.  D.,  after  thirty  years  of  arduous  laborsamongst  us  feels  constrained  to  seek  relief  fromthe  burdens  and  responsibilities  of  the  pastorate,and  has  advised  us  of  his  intention  to  apply  topresbytery  to  dissolve  the  pastoral  relations  existing  between  him  and  this  church,  therefore,Resolved,  That  this  session  desires  to  placeon  record  its  very  deep  sense  of  Dr.  Hall's  untiring  and  unselfish  labors,  and  the  great  blessingswhich  have  attended  his  ministry.  Coming  tothis  country  and  becoming  our  pastor  in  1867,  hehas  gone  in  and  out  amongst  us  for  thirty  years,preaching  the  Word,  visiting  our  sick,  buryingour  dead,  and  bringing  comfort  and  help  to  soulsSUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS       315cast  down  and  sorrowful.  The  prosperity  andusefulness  of  our  church  for  so  many  years  bearwitness  to  the  blessings  which  have  attended  hislabors.  Nor  have  these  labors  been  confined  tothis  church  alone:  Church  Extension  in  thisCity,  Home  and  Foreign  Missions,  MinisterialEducation,  Support  and  Relief,  all  Church  workhas  been  benefited  by  his  services.  Indeed,  noform  of  religious  or  philanthropic  labor  can  besaid  to  be  alien  to  him.  His  influence  for  goodhas  been  felt  and  recognized  throughout  thewhole  Christian  world,  not  merely  in  his  ownbut  in  every  other  evangelical  denomination.Resolved,  That  a  meeting  of  the  church  andcongregation  be  called  to  take  action  on  thepastor's  resignation,  on  Wednesday  evening,January  19,  1898,  at  8  o'clock  in  the  lecture  room,and  that  due  notice  of  the  same  be  given  from  thepulpit  at  the  morning  service  on  the  two  preceding  Sabbaths,  as  required  by  the  laws  of  this  State.Resolved,  That  we  will  recommend  to  thechurch  and  congregation  at  the  meeting  so  to  becalled,  that  they  accede  to  the  pastor's  request,and  for  that  purpose  that  they  appoint  commissioners  to  presbytery  to  unite  with  him  in  seekinga  dissolution  of  the  pastoral  relation.And  further  that  we  will  recommend  them  to316        SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSappoint  Dr.  Hall  "Pastor  Emeritus,"  and  votehim  an  appropriate  retiring  allowance.And  that  we  will  also  recommend  that  theyappoint  a  committee  to  cooperate  with  a  similarcommittee,  to  be  appointed  by  the  session,  totake  steps  looking  to  the  choosing  of  a  suitable  successor  to  the  pastorate.Resolved,  That  we  unite  with  our  pastor  inrequesting  the  Rev.  Dr.  Howard  Duffield  of  thePresbytery  of  New  York  to  act  as  moderator  atthe  said  meeting  of  the  church  and  congregation.This  minute  was  adopted  at  a  special  meetingof  the  session  held  on  the  6th  of  January,  andmy  father  read  the  following  letter:ji2  Fifth  Avenue,New  York,  6th  January,  i8q8.DEAR  BRETHREN  OF  THE  SESSION  :Having  been  privileged  to  preach  the  Gospel  for  morethan  forty-eight  years,  and  having  been  pastor  of  the  FifthAvenue  congregation  for  thirty  years,  I  have  decided —  afterlengthened  and  prayerful  consideration  of  the  matter — to  resign  the  pastorate  of  the  church,  and  so  to  give  opportunity  tothe  congregation  to  choose  a  successor  of  requisite  energy  andvigor  for  the  work;  and  I  pray  God  to  guide  the  congregation— in  which  I  have  felt  the  deepest  interest,  and  for  the  spiritualgood  of  whose  members  I  have  labored — in  the  selection.Whatever  appears  to  the  session  to  be  best  in  the  circumstances— whether  to  give  up  pastoral  work  and  preaching  at  once,  orto  go  on  until  a  successor  is  found — I  am  ready  to  undertake.I  am,  Dear  Brethren,Fraternally  yours,J.  HALL.SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS       317The  session  adjourned,  and  met  again  on  the1 7th  of  January,  1898,  when  the  resolutions  appended  were  passed:Resolved,  That  the  session  recommend  to  thecongregation  that  in  accordance  with  the  pastor'swish  and  the  report  of  our  committee,  the  following  resolutions  be  passed:Resolved,  That  this  church  unites  with  theReverend  Dr.  John  Hall  in  his  application  topresbytery  for  the  dissolution  of  the  pastoral  relations,  and  appoint  commissioners  to  representthis  church  in  presbytery,  and  instruct  them  tosupport  our  pastor's  application,  to  take  effect  onthe  1 5th  day  of  June,  1898,  and  not  earlier.Resolved,  That  the  Reverend  Dr.  John  Hall  beappointed  pastor  emeritus  of  this  church  fromand  after  the  i^th  day  of  June,  1898,  and  that  anannual  salary  of  Five  thousand  ($5,000)  dollarsbe  paid  to  him  during  the  continuance  of  suchrelations.Resolved,  That  commissioners  above  namedbe  authorized  with  the  trustees  of  this  church  toexecute  an  agreement  to  that  effect  on  behalf  ofthis  church  and  congregation.The  reading  however  of  the  letter  and  the  resolutions  had  called  out  a  storm  of  questions.Those  questions  were  imprudently  answered  by318        SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSmembers  of  the  session,  and  the  private  meetingsbecame  public  property.Although  the  action  had  been  hitherto  unanimous  certain  members  of  the  session  felt  deeplyhurt  at  things  said  to  the  now  weary  and  heartsick  pastor.  That  the  resignation  was  forcedupon  my  father  was  not  only  known,  but  evenbrutally  boasted  about  by  one  of  those  opposedto  him.  The  storm  of  indignation  that  at  oncebroke  loose  was  a  tribute  to  the  immense  powermy  father  yielded.  The  session  was  at  once  indifficulty,  and  felt  that  they  were  without  support  in  the  congregation.  From  the  situationonly  some  strong  word  of  support  from  the  pastor  stating  that  the  resignation  was  wholly  voluntary  could  save  them.  But  a  truthful  denialwas  under  the  circumstances  impossible.  Oneof  the  members  of  his  session  summed  up  the  situation  in  a  letter  to  my  father  of  the  i8th  ofJanuary:MY  DEAR  DR.  HALL:I  must  express  to  you  my  feelings  of  sadness  in  thetreatment  you  have  received  from  the  majority  of  our  session.I  cannot  forget  the  harsh  words  spoken  to  you  by  some  ofthem — you  who  have  been  so  faithful  and  so  untiring  for  such  anumber  of  years.  I  cannot  understand  how  they  can  expectyou  now  to  come  and  stand  in  the  breach  which  their  blunder-ing  has  brought  about.After  leaving  the  room  last  evening  some  of  them  said  thatSUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS       319if  you  would  write  a  strong  letter  all  would  be  made  right.  Isaid  how  can  you  expect  Dr.  Hall  to  write  a  strong  letter  afterthe  way  some  of  the  session  have  spoken  to  him.  I  do  notthink  you  should  say  any  more  than  what  you  did  in  your  letterof  resignation.  If  you  leave  hundreds  will  follow  you,  andleave  the  church  to  go  elsewhere,  so  it  will  not  be  for  the  goodof  the  congregation.  I  trust  you  will  stand  where  you  are  andlet  the  congregation  show  you  and  the  session  what  they  desire.I  am  yours  very  truly.Hundreds  of  letters  came  pouring  in.  Manycalled,  and  in  three  days  it  was  plain  that  theresignation  under  such  circumstances  would  leada  large  number  to  leave  the  church.  Membersof  the  session  had  led  my  father  to  believe  thatpractically  the  whole  of  the  congregation  hadbeen  sounded,  and  desired  his  resignation;he  was  now  willing  to  leave  the  whole  matterto  the  congregation.  This  was  the  course  urgedby  advisers  in  whom  he  trusted.On  the  nineteenth  of  January  the  congregationmet  and  passed  the  following  resolutions:WHEREAS,  The  session  of  the  Fifth  AvenuePresbyterian  Church  has  called  this  meeting  ofthe  congregation  to  take  action  on  the  proposedresignation  of  our  pastor,  Dr.  John  Hall,  referredto  in  his  letter  to  the  session  under  date  of  January  6th,  1898,Resolved,  That  the  congregation  respectfullydecline  to  accept  or  to  approve  of  such  proposed320        SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSresignation,  and  also  decline  to  appoint  commissioners  for  the  purpose  of  uniting  with  the  pastor  in  seeking  a  dissolution  of  the  pastoral  relation  by  the  presbytery;  andResolved,  That  adopting  as  an  expression  of  thefeelings  of  this  congregation,  the  several  petitions  and  resolutions  of  the  Ladies'  Auxiliary,  theYoung  Women's  Missionary  Society,  the  YoungPeople's  Association,  the  Sunday-school,  and  ofthe  members  of  the  church  and  congregationpresented  herewith  as  part  of  this  resolution,  andtendering  to  Dr.  Hall  the  loving  assurance  of  cooperation  with  him  in  the  future  work  of  thischurch,  the  congregation  urgently  request  him  toreconsider  and  withdraw  any  and  all  action  taken  byhim  looking  towards  such  resignation  ;  and  further,Resolved,  That  Messrs.

HALL.324       SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSTo  the  committee  my  father  made  the  following  communication:MY  DEAR  FRIENDS  :On  the  6th  of  January  in  presenting  my  resignation  ofthe  pastorate  of  the  congregation  at  a  meeting  of  session  Ioffered  to  give  up  work  at  once,  or  to  go  on  until  a  successorshould  be  found.  One  of  a  series  of  very  kind  resolutions  ofthe  session  was  that  a  meeting  of  the  church  and  congregationshould  be  held  on  January  igth  to  take  action  on  the  resignation,  according  to  our  form  of  government.That  meeting  was  held  on  January  the  igth  and  it  was  dulyreported  to  me  that  the  clerk  of  session  was  the  secretary,  thatseveral  of  the  elders  were  present,  and  that  there  was  no  otherview  presented  than  that — as  you  were  appointed  to  inform  me— my  resignation  should  not  be  accepted  ;  and  no  committeewas  appointed  to  carry  the  matter  to  presbytery.Believing  that  this  meeting  represented  the  feelings  of  thechurch  and  congregation,  and  having  had  many  most  tenderappeals  from  members,  and  there  having  been  no  other  coursesuggested  by  the  officers  of  the  church,  I  announced  from  thepulpit  on  the  following  Lord's  day  my  willingness  to  continuein  service,  so  long  as  strength  was  given  from  above,  and  thiswas  done  from  an  earnest  desire  to  quiet  anxiety  on  the  subjectand  continue  the  happy  Christian  unity  of  the  congregation.In  Dr.  Hodge's  book  on  Presbyterian  Law  there  is  a  statementof  what  is  to  be  done  under  such  circumstances  by  the  pastor(section  quoted).  Let  me  add,  dear  friends,  as  representingthe  congregation,  that  I  mean  to  continue  as  active  pastor,  onlywhile  the  services  are  for  the  spiritual  good  of  the  congregation.I  am  responsible  to  the  Head  of  the  Church  for  the  best  interestsof  the  members,  whether  rich  or  poor,  and  God  helping  me  Ishall  do  the  best  I  can  for  them.  Considering  the  many  yearsof  work  graciously  given  me,  that  period  cannot  be  very  remote,  and  my  prayer  is  that  the  Divine  Head  of  the  Churchmay  direct  to  the  harmonious  choice  of  an  "  able  minister  "  asSUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWS       325successor  ;  and  in  the  meantime,  if  it  seem  fit,  to  a  competeniassistant.     I  am,  dear  brethren  in  the  good  hope  through  grace,Truly  yoursJOHN  HALL.The  result,  although  foreseen  by  some,  distressed  my  father  beyond  measure.  The  trusteesresigned  in  a  body,  and  nine  of  the  elders  tendered  their  resignations,  saying  they  regarded  thestep  as  forced  upon  them  by  the  action  of  thecongregation.Undoubtedly  hard  things  had  been  said  of  thesession,  and  it  was  true  that  they  undoubtedlydeeply  misunderstood  the  mind  of  the  congregation,  and  no  longer  represented  it.  A  strongbody  of  trustees  was  at  once  elected  to  take  theplace  of  those  resigned,  but  delay  was  urged  tosee  if  the  session  might  not  be  reconstituted  asof  old.  This  was  found  to  be  impossible,  theresignations  were  accepted  and  good  men  wereelected  in  their  places.  Some  left  the  church,  butthe  enthusiasm  called  out  by  the  struggle  to  retain  their  beloved  pastor  far  more  than  offset  anysuch  losses.The  strain  of  a  long  interval  since  then  withouta  pastor  has  been  splendidly  withstood,  and  aftermy  father's  death  upon  obtaining  competentleadership  the  work  of  the  church  was  resumed326       SUCCESSES  AND  SHADOWSwith  full  vigor,  and  perhaps  with  an  increasedsense  of  congregational  responsibility  for  thesuccess  and  condition  of  all  the  work  in  whichthe  church  was  engaged.The  scenes  of  affection,  and  the  evidences  ofdevotion  deeply  touched  my  father.He  had  however  felt  a  shock  that  warned  himhow  deeply  his  life  was  bound  up  with  his  people.  A  coarse  insulting  letter  from  a  member  ofhis  session  utterly  misrepresenting  the  course  ofevents  was  the  only  incident  on  which  I  everheard  from  him  an  indignant  word.  The  misrepresentation  of  his  motives,  the  coldness  ofthose  whom  he  loved  as  his  children,  and  theshameful  misrepresentations  of  the  feelings  ofthe  congregation  had  done  their  work.  Theproud,  shy,  self-contained  heart,  schooled  to  self-control,  to  passionate  pity,  and  to  tender  consideration  for  every  one  but  itself,,  broke  underthe  strain.  The  shadow  of  the  coming  translation  was  already  on  the  home.XIII.

HOMELONGINGS.  THE  LAS T  HOURS  .THE  wonderful  self-possession  that  markedmy  father's  life  at  any  crisis,  never  lefthim  during  the  agitations  and  excitements  of  thedays  of  great  strain  in  the  beginning  of  1898.After  the  successful  reorganization  of  the  church,and  after  the  election  of  a  strong  body  of  trusteeshad  insured  the  pecuniary  affairs,  he  took  upwork  with  seeming  vigor;  the  workers  werecalled  together,  the  various  branches  of  church-life  reviewed.  The  session  that  had  resigned  haddesired  to  close  a  mission  church  which  my  fatherthought  the  congregation  under  a  moral  obligationto  maintain,  the  funds  for  keeping  it  up  were  atonce  put  into  the  new  session's  hands,  and  the  offerof  the  sale  of  the  building  was  withdrawn.  Thecongregations  increased,  no  doubt,  in  part  throughthe  publicity  given  to  the  resignation  and  its  withdrawal.329330      THE  LAST  JOURNEY  HOMEThe  outward  composure  was  however  paid  forby  a  heavy  price.  Naturally  a  man  of  peace,dearly  devoted  to  the  interests  of  the  congregation,it  had  been  a  heavy  blow  to  be  dealt  with  soroughly.  Men  of  affairs,  accustomed  to  battlewith  not  overscrupulous  opponents;  roughenedby  life  on  the  plane  of  the  ethics  of  "  the  street,"and  accustomed  to  force  their  plans  to  an  issuewithout  much  consideration  for  others'  feelings,were  not  in  a  position  to  judge  of  what  the  disturbance,  and  their  desertion  of  my  father  costhim.  The  crisis  came  when  relative  peace  andharmony  had  been  restored  by  the  withdrawalfrom  the  counsels  of  the  Church  of  all  save  oneor  two  of  those  not  in  sympathy  with  the  pastor.On  March  25th  my  father  was  taken  suddenlywith  trouble  of  the  poor  weary  heart.  Hestruggled  manfully  against  the  rapidly  increasingdisablement.  In  May  he  presided  at  the  communion  service,  but  speaking  was  too  great  arisk,  and  although  he  conducted  some  funeralsand  married  a  few  couples,  he  had  to  foregopreaching,  and  in  June  was  sent  by  the  doctorsacross  the  water  to  find  the  rest  which  nowalone  promised  any  hope  of  recovery.  Thepresent  writer  was  in  Europe  and  hurried  atonce  to  England  to  meet  the  parents  at  BuxtonTHE  LAST  JOURNEY  HOME     331whither  the  doctors  had  sent  them.  The  changewrought  by  that  fatal  winter  was  all  too  apparent.  The  strong  ceaseless  worker  was  abroken  and  tired-out  patient.  No  complaintswere  on  his  lips,  but  the  pulse  was  irregular,  andthe  breathing  often  bad;  what  the  doctorsordered  was  gently  and  uncomplainingly  taken.In  Buxton  the  strength  seemed  at  least  to  holdout,  and  having  made  arrangements  to  meet  theparents  again  the  writer  went  back  to  the  continent.While  at  Buxton  a  great  longing  overcame  myfather  to  visit  once  more  the  old  home  amid  thegreen  fields  of  Ireland.  He  longed  again  to  exchange  greetings  with  the  sisters  whose  lovenever  left  him.Unwilling  to  postpone  his  visit  he  telegraphedme  not  to  come  back  to  Ireland,  and  that  he  andmy  mother  would  make  the  journey  alone.  ThatI  knew  to  be  out  of  the  question  and  leavingAustria  I  hurried  as  fast  as  possible  up  to  thenorth  of  England  and  arrived  in  time  to  catchthem  still  there.  The  change  in  the  few  weekswas  all  too  obvious.  The  springy  step  was  theslow  pace  of  a  worn-out  man.  Heart  stimulanthad  to  be  taken  at  intervals  that  seemed  mostalarming.  The  journey  to  Ireland  passed  off332      THE  LAST  JOURNEY  HOMEfairly  well,  and  fair  weather  favored  thetravellers.Great  was  my  father's  delight  to  find  at  Holy-head  Dr.  and  Mrs.  Hamilton  Magee  his  old  college  chum  and  his  wife,  lifelong  devoted  friends.That  little  meeting  was  sweet  and  fragrant  withtender  words  of  love  and  confidence,  even  as  ifeach  knew  that  only  in  the  everlasting  peacewould  they  see  each  other  again.In  Dublin  a  rest  had  to  be  taken.  On  Sabbathmorning  we  went  together  back  to  the  oldfamiliar  church  on  Rutland  Square,  where  indays  now  forever  past  crowds  had  hung  on  thewords  of  gentle  comfort,  strong  warning  andglorious  offers  of  eternal  life.  It  was  the  lastpublic  service  he  was  ever  to  attend.My  father  could  scarcely  bare  the  strain  ofstanding,  and  the  kindly  greetings  of  those  whocame  up  to  him  awestruck  and  saddened  by  thegreat  change,  greatly  wearied  him.  One  hasborne  witness  in  print  to  the  impression  thenmade."That  Dr.  Hall  had  been  wounded,  harassed,humiliated  no  one  who  saw  the  change  theselast  years  made  in  him  could  doubt.  With  sadhearts  his  friends  saw  him  a  broken  man,  andthis  at  the  end  of  his  long,  faithful  life.  PerhapsTHE  LAST  JOURNEY  HOME     333it  was  all  needed  to  loosen  the  strong  ties  ofearth.  The  storm  made  him  welcome  the  haven.Perhaps  he  needed  to  know  more  fully  than  hehad  yet  known  'the  fellowship  of  His  sufferings.'  Anyhow  he  has  won  his  rest."The  old  strong  longing  for  the  fields  of  thequiet  north  of  Ireland  made  itself  felt,  but  thephysical  condition  made  the  journey  impossible.Monday  he  rested,  and  on  Tuesday  got  up  anddrove  out  for  a  little.  That  day  our  visit  wasmade  to  the  old  time  friend  of  long  ago;  Mr.Smith  of  the  Vice  Regal  Lodge  gardens  wassought  out.  He  also  was  nearing  the  settingsun,  and  waiting  for  the  dayspring  from  onhigh.  In  broken  accents  prayer  was  offered  up,and  as  we  drove  away  through  the  once  sofamiliar  fields  of  Phoenix  Park  old  memories  ofpast  friendships  and  bright  hopes  of  future  reunions  stirred  my  father  to  an  outburst  of  gentlethankfulness  for  God's  wonderful  goodnessamid  the  calms  as  amidst  the  storms  of  his  life.The  journey  to  Bangor  was  to  have  been  brokenat  Belfast,  but  my  father's  impatience  to  see  hissister  would  brook  no  delay,  and  we  went  on.This  journey  tested  all  his  strength,  and  withdifficulty  he  was  gotten  to  bed  in  the  home  onCrawfordsburn  Road  that  was  to  be  for  him  the334      THE  LAST  JOURNEY  HOMEportal  to  the  Eternal  City.  He  had  hoped  tovisit  Ballygorman,  the  place  of  his  childhood  andbirth.  This  was  no  longer  to  be  thought  of,  butto  satisfy  him  I  left  him  for  a  night,  and  broughtback  word  from  the  old  home,  and  warned  thesorrowing  sisters  of  the  serious  character  of  theillness.Ceaselessly  my  mother  tended  with  untiringlove  the  gentle  uncomplaining  invalid.  For  thoselast  days  a  Heavenly  Father  gave  a  most  remarkable  strength  and  endurance  to  one,  who  hadherself  been  very  near  the  gates.  Towards  evening  one  day  my  father  ventured  a  few  stepsfrom  the  house  to  overlook  the  sea,  on  which  theevening  sun  was  shining,  tipping  the  waveletswith  a  golden  red.  To  him  it  seemed  an  imageof  that  everlasting  beauty  awaiting  him  in  thepresence  of  his  Saviour  King.Now  and  then  he  asked  me  if  his  voice  wasweak.  It  was,  alas,  weak  and  husky,  but  this,I  assured  him  was  natural  after  so  severe  an  illness.  His  sisters  and  old  friends  from  Belfastvisited  him,  and  he  seemed  cheered  and  helpedby  these  visits.  Indeed  in  Dublin  also  faithfulfriends  greatly  comforted  him,  and  when  at  thestation  a  lifelong  and  dearly  loved  friend  broughther  sister's  little  girls  with  fruit  and  flowers  heTHE  LAST  JOURNEY  HOME      335was  wonderfully  brightened  up  and  cheered  byit.  Yet  on  the  whole,  weakness  asserted  itselfmore  and  more.  Less  and  less  did  the  beatingheart  respond  to  the  remedies,  and  when  onWednesday  I  returned  from  the  old  homesteadwith  news  from  Ballygorman,  the  physician  incharge  had  wisely  telegraphed  for  assistance  fromBelfast.  But  the  specialist  could  do  no  more  thanwas  being  done.  The  diagnosis  was  musculardegeneration  of  the  heart,  what  is  so  patheticallycalled  in  popular  tongue  "the  sad  heart"  a  condition  the  doctor  said — although  knowing  nothing  of  the  circumstances  of  my  father's  illness —due  to  worry  and  anxiety.  The  doctors  held  outno  hope.  From  that  on  only  watching  and  waiting  was  our  portion.  There  were  intervals  ofrestlessness,  and  then  apathy,  then  a  ceaselessstruggle  for  breath  marked  the  closing  hours.The  last  night  we  watched  together,  motherand  son,  and  when  the  morning  broke,  the  sunshining  over  the  water  and  flooding  the  roomwith  splendid  glory,  the  Saviour  called  the  tiredmessenger  home  to  peace  and  rest  and  his  everlasting  reward.XIV.

THE  REMAINS  TAKEN  TO  NEWYORK.  SERVICES  IN  NEW  YORK.  TRIBUTES  TO  THE  MEMORY.THE  LAS  T  T^£S  TING- PL  ACE.THE  passage  for  my  parents  had  been  takenon  the  Cunard  Line  for  the  i7th  of  September,  but,  of  course,  word  had  been  duly  sentthat  illness  would  prevent  their  sailing.  Arrangements  were  therefore  now  made  for  taking  thedear  remains  the  following  week.  The  eldestson  had  arrived  half-an-hour  after  the  closingscene,  having  travelled  in  haste  to  Bangor.  OnSabbath  afternoon  simple  services  were  held  inthe  home  of  the  sister,  Mrs.  Magowan.In  that  home  my  father  had  had  peculiar  pleasure,  as  he  aided  in  planning  and  building  thehouse.  The  Rev.  Mr.  I.  McCauly,  the  pastor  ofone  of  the  Presbyterian  churches  in  Bangor,  mostkindly  and  sympathetically  conducted  simpleservices,  assisted  by  the  Rev.  Mr.  Robert  Patterson  and  the  Rev.  Mr.  Crawford.  The  moderatorof  the  General  Assembly  most  kindly  desiredmore  public  recognition  in  the  way  of  a  larger339340  THE  LAST  RITESservice,  but  the  health  of  my  mother,  and  thedread  of  increasing  a  strain  already  great  madesuch  a  course  impossible.The  funeral  services  in  New  York  were  on  themorning  of  October  the  4th,  1898,  in  the  FifthAvenue  Presbyterian  Church  into  which  so  muchof  my  father's  life  had  been  built.  Dr.  John  Mc-Intosh  of  Philadelphia,  Dr.  Wm.  M.  Paxton  ofPrinceton  and  the  moderator  of  the  General  Assembly  of  that  year,  the  Rev.  Dr.  Radcliffe  tookcharge  of  the  services,  and  paid  tributes  to  theworth  and  services  of  him  whom  God  had  taken.On  Wednesday  morning  the  remains  were  takento  Woodlawn  and  laid  to  rest  beside  the  belovednephew,  the  Rev.  John  Magowan,  and  near  hisstepson  Major  John  Irwin.  The  final  arrangements  of  the  monument  have  not  yet  been  made,and  only  a  simple  head-stone  with  a  reference  toDaniel  12:3,  marks  the  place  where  lies  the  sacreddust.Great  was  the  outburst  of  real  sorrow  whenthe  news  spread  that  the  great  preacher  andfaithful  pastor  was  to  be  seen  and  heard  nomore  on  earth.  In  London,  Edinburgh,  Dublin,Belfast,  Glasgow,  as  well  as  all  the  principalcities  of  the  United  States,  memorial  sermonswere  preached,  and  memorial  services  were  held.THE  LAST  RITES  341Great  numbers  of  ecclesiastical  bodies  on  bothsides  of  the  water,  Methodists,  Baptists,  Congregational,  Episcopalian  and  others,  joined  in  tributes  of  esteem  and  sorrow.  Nearly  all  the  English  written  press  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlanticand  many  foreign  journals  contained  estimatesof  the  power  and  value  of  the  life  that  had  p:ijsedaway.  The  London  Times  paid  a  warm  it  luteto  the  influence  of  the  life  that  was  clos  >) ;  andwhat  marked  nearly  all  these  estimates  was  theprominence  given  to  the  directness  and  simplicity  of  the  life  and  work.  It  was  agreed  that  theelements  that  went  to  make  up  my  father's  character  were  not  unduly  complex,  yet  poise,  industry,  strength  of  conviction  and  masterly  control  of  all  those  elements  gave  extraordinaryforce  to  the  life.The  widow,  three  sons,  a  stepson  and  onedaughter  survive  the  father;  and  were  all  so  faras  health  permitted  present  at  the  last  sad  offices.For  him  to  die  was  gain.  A  life  singularly  unselfish  and  remarkably  unspoilt  by  unbroken  success  went  down  at  last  amid  the  cloud-storms  ofopposition  and  betrayal;  but  God  gave  sweetpeace,  and  gently  took  a  faithful  servant  home  tojoin  in  the  chorus  of  redemption  in  the  presenceforever  of  his  Saviour  King.
