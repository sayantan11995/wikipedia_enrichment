ATHELWOLD OK ^ETHELWOLD" The parents of St. J^thelwold were residents in thecity of Winchester, and lived in the days of EdmundKing of the English, being honoured with a remark-able gift from G-od, in that they had deserved to givebirth to such a son, through whose example not onlythe people of the present age, but those who shallcome after, might have been preserved from theTherefore his fortunate mother,darkness of error.166LIFE OF sETHELWOLD167"while the babe was yet in her womb, had thefollowing dream, a presage of future results.It seemed to her that she was sitting in front ofthe doors of her house, and she saw a lofty banner,the top of which appeared to touch the heavens, andthis, bending down, surrounded the pregnant womanto her honour with its threads.Again, upon fallingasleep in that same night, she saw as it were agolden eagle, coming forth out of her mouth andflying away, so large that the whole city seemed tobe overshadowed by its golden wings."Of these dreams, as the event proved, we canguess the meaning easily. We understand by thelofty banner that her son, whom she bore in herwomb, would be a standard-bearer of the army ofGod, as indeed he was ; and by the golden eagle thathe would be a remarkable man, as the Lord saith in' Wheresoever the body is, thither willthe Gospel,the eagles be gathered together.'" On another occasion, when the mother wasstanding in the church, crowded with townspeopleto hear Mass, she felt that the soul of the boy, whomshe bore in her womb, came and entered into him ;as afterwards the holy man himself, who was then tobe born, when a bishop, related to us with rejoicing.Whence it is evident that he had been a chosen oneof God even before he was born, and that the soul ofa man does not come from his father or his mother,but is given to each by God alone."When the infant was born, his parents calledhim ^Ethelwold, when he received the ablution ofFor it happened upon a certain dayHoly Baptism.of solemnity, while the mother was sitting at home168AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTand holding the infant in her lap, that a storm ofwind arose, so that she was unable to go to thechurch as she had intended, but, when with groansshe had given herself to prayer, she suddenly foundherself sitting in the church with her baby wherethe presbyter was celebrating Mass." So the boy grew, and in his boyhood he wasalready occupied in sacred studies. And when hebecame a young man, his reputation spreading, hebecame known to ^Ethelstan, the King, the son ofEdward, and was for a long time one of his retinue,being of quick intelligence, and he learnt manythings that were useful to him from the wise coun-After a while, at the desire ofcillors of the King.the King, he was tonsured and consecrated to thepriesthood by ^Elphege, Bishop of Winchester." Now ^Elphege himself was full of the spirit ofprophecy, and it happened that he was ordaining atthe same time Dunstan and ^Ethelwold, and a mannamed ^Etelstane, who afterwards abandoned themonastic habit and remained an apostate to the endof his life. When Mass was over, Bishop -ZElphegesaid to those around him, ' To-day I have consecratedthree priests, of whom two will reach the episcopaldignity, one in my seat, the other in a different' Am I one of thediocese/two who are to attain the honour of episcopacy?'' Not so/ said uElphege,' nor wilt thou abide in theholiness wherewith thou hast begun.' And thus itturned out with him.Then ./Etelstane said,"^thelwold, being much improved by the teachingand the example of ^Elphege, who had ordained him,and with whom he carefully remained for a while, asLIFE OF ^STHELWOLD169the King commanded, came afterwards to Glaston-bury and gave himself over to the discipleship ofthat magnificent man Dunstan, who was abbot of themonastery, and having profited much by his training,he at length received from Dunstan the garb of themonastic order, being with lowly devotion given toThere he learnt the art of theobserve its rule.grammarian, and the laws of metre, and the holybooks and authors ; devoting himself only too muchto fasting and prayer, and taming himself by abstin-ence, and constantly exhorting the brethren to riseto lofty and difficult heights." A good while after he had taken up the office of amonk he made up his mind to go abroad, to deepenhis knowledge of sacred books, and of monasticdiscipline, but the venerable Queen Eadgifu, motherof King Eadred, opposed his purpose, advising theKing not to permit so valuable a man to go out ofKing Eadred was then pleased, at thehis kingdom.suggestion of his mother, to give the venerable man^Ethelwold a certain locality called Abingdon, inwhich from old days there had been a small monastery,but which then lay destitute and neglected, consistingof poor buildings and possessing only 40 mansse ;the rest of the land in that place (one hundred hides)being owned by the King in right of the crown.Soit came about that, with the consent of Dunstan, andaccording to the King's desire, ^thelwold undertookthe charge of the place, with a view to establish init monks who would serve God under rule (theBenedictine rule). As servant of God he settledthere, and certain clerics from Glastonbury followedFrithegar, andhim, namelyOsgar, Foldbircht,170AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTOrdbircht of Winchester, and Eadric of London,submitting themselves to his discipleship, and hegathered round him in a short space of time a flockof monks over whom, by the command of the king,he was appointed abbot." Moreover the King gave the royal estate whichhe owned in Abingdon (that is a hundred hides) withits excellent buildings, to the abbot and brethren toadd to their daily provision, and he assisted themmuch with money, but his mother did so with stillgreater liberality. The King came to the monasteryon a certain day, that he might himself arrange theplan of the buildings, and he measured all thefoundations of the monastery with his own hand, inaccordance with what he had decided for the walls,and the abbot invited him and his attendants to theguest chamber to dinner. To this the King immedi-ately consented, and there happened to be not a fewwith him, who had come from the people of North-umberland, and they all proceeded to the entertain-ment with the King. He was very merry, andordered that plenty of mead should be set before theguests, and the doors to be shut to prevent any oneshirking his drink, and so deserting the rules of thefeast. What need of many words? the servantsdrew the liquor all day long in sufficiency for theguests, and yet it could not be exhausted, there beingthe depth of a hand left in the cask, when theNorthumbrians went home in the evening, as drunkas swine." But the abbot did not build the edifice assignedto him in the days of Eadred the King, for he soondied, but in the reign of Eadgar he erected andLIFE OF ^ETHELWOLD171completed a church and dedicated it in honour ofthe holy Mother of God, and ever Virgin.This canbe better shown by the sight of it, than by word." About this time Dunstan was chosen Bishop ofWinchester, and after some years he was madeArchbishop of Canterbury, and abode in Kent thirtyand seven years, an immovable pillar in doctrine,and remarkable for his teaching and almsgiving.We have heard that miracles are often wrought athis tomb." ^Ethelwold moreover sent Osgar the monk oversea to the monastery of St. Benedict at Meury, thathe might there learn the customs of the rule, andmight show and teach them to the brethren at home.For he desired himself to follow the regular patternof the rule, and to avoid any wanderings from it,that he might lead the flock committed to him toThere was in the saidthe promised home-land.Society a certain brother, named -ZElfstan, a man ofgreat simplicity and readiness to obey, whom theabbot had ordered to provide the food for the work-people of the monastery ; and he had given himselfup to this humble service with the utmost devoted-ness. He cooked the meat every day and distributedit to the workmen, he lighted the fire and carriedthe water, and washed the vessels after their use,himself, while the abbot thought that he performedthis with the help of a servant. And it happenedone day, when the abbot was going round themonastery, as his custom was, that he saw thisbrother standing near the heated kitchen, preparingthe victuals for the workmen, and on entering heobserved all the vessels to be extremely clean, and172AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOT'the floor swept, and he said to him with a joyfulmy brother, you have stolen thiscountenance,obedience from me, which without my knowledgeyou are exercising, but if you are such a soldier ofChrist as you appear to be, put your hand into theboiling water, and bring up a crust from those atthe bottom.' He at once without delay, putting hishand to the bottom of the cauldron, brought up ahot crust, feeling nothing of the heat of the boilingwater. When the abbot saw this, he ordered thatthe crust should be put aside, and that nothingshould be told to any man living. We have heardthat this brother was afterwards made our abbot,and since then we have certainly seen him Bishop ofthe Church of Winchester."^Ethelwold was a great builder, both when hewas an abbot and when he became a bishop ; hencethe common enemy laid snares for him, and one daywhen he was working at the building, a huge postfell upon him, and knocked him down into a pit,and broke nearly all his ribs on one side, and hadnot the pit received him, he would have been entirelycrushed. But he recovered from this misfortune,with the help of God, and Eadgar the most fortunateKing of the English chose him for the bishopric ofthe church of Winchester, before the church above-mentioned was dedicated, and at the desire of theking, Dunstan Archbishop of Canterbury consecratedhim. At that time there were in the old monastery1 beset with(at Winchester) clergy of bad morals,1 See Dean Hook, Lives of the Archbishops, vol. i. p. 429.TheDean offers a vigorous defence of the married clergy, and condemnsLIFE OF sETHELWOLD173pride, arrogance, and self-indulgence, so much sothat many of them disdained to celebrate the Massesin the proper order, putting away their wives, whomthey had married contrary to law, and taking others,being constantly given to greediness and intemper-The holy man ^thelwold could not endureance.this, and obtaining the sanction of King Eadgar hevery quickly drove out these abominable blasphemersof God from the monastery, and bringing in monksfrom Abingdon he placed them here, being himselfabbot and bishop over them.It happened then thatthe monks who had come from Abingdon werestanding at the entrance to the church, and theclerks were inside, finishing the Mass and singingthe Communion Service,' Serve the Lord in fearand rejoice unto Him with reverence,accept discipline,lest the Lord should be angry, etc,' as if they said,' We are unwilling to serve God, or to hold to thisdiscipline ; do you at least fulfil this, lest you perishHearing this in their chant, the monkslike us.'said to each other, 'Why do we delay outside?Behold we are exhorted to enter.'Moreover theKing sent one of his most renowned attendants,Wulfstan by name, who by the royal authority badethe clergy either give place to the monks withoutBut they,delay, or accept the monastic habit.hating the monastic life, went out of the church at1JSthelwold's action. He may be right, for a victorious party isriot likely to speak fairly of the faults of the defeated.1Kirkpatrick, Cambridge Bible, renders "embrace instruction,"" obedience" ; so the LXX, "lay hold of instruction."Thisorquotation is taken from the Latin Vulgate, Ps. ii. 12, where our" Kiss the Son, lest He be angry."

For at that time there had been no monksin England except at Glastonbury and Abingdon."Eventually from the ill-will of the clerks, ithappened that poison was given to the bishop whenhe was dining with his guests in his hall, theythinking that when he was dead they could enjoytheir former vices. Now it was his habit, on accountof his weak health, after three or four mouthfuls totake a moderate sip; he drank without knowingthat poison had been brought to him, and swallowedall the contents of the cup.Immediately his faceturned pale, and his bowels were greatly tormentedThen he rose up, withby the force of the poison.difficulty getting from the table to his bed, and thepoison ran through all his limbs, threatening death.But after awhile he began to remonstrate with him-' Where is now thy faith ?self, saying to his soul,Where are the words of Christ, in which He said,If they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt' With this and the like words the faiththem ?kindled in him extinguished the deadliness of thedraft that he had swallowed, and he soon rose up,and went back to the hall cheerfully enough, inflict-ing no punishment on his poisoner." After that JSthelwold expanded his wings, and(with the consent of the King Eadgar) he drove outthe clergy from the New monastery (at Winchester)and appointed ^thelgar his disciple as abbot, andunder him monks that lived by the rule, and^Ethelgar was subsequently made Archbishop inKent.LIFE OF &THELWOLD175"At Abingdon he made Osgar abbot, and themonastery was enriched by 600 hides or more. Alsofor a nunnery he consecrated sisters, and placed.ZEtheldrith over them as Mother."There was a situation in a region called Ely,very much ennobled by the relies and miracles of.^Ethelthryth, virgin and saint, and of her sister-hood ; but it was at that time desolate, and belongedJEthelwold bought this ofto the King's treasury.the King, and established there a good many monks,over whom he placed as Father a disciple of hisnamed Brithnode, and he enriched the place moreabundantly with buildings and land.Anotherlocality he also acquired from the King and thenobles of the land, situate on the bank of the riverNen, which of old used to be called in the tongue ofthe English Medehamstede, and now is known asBurh, and there he brought together monks in thesame way, placing over them Adulf, who later onobtained the archiepiscopate of the city of York.He also obtained a third locality by paying for it,near the aforesaid river, called Thorney in English,which he handed over to monks under the sameconditions, and when the monastery had been builthe appointed a man named Godman to be abbot, andgave ample possessions to the brotherhood.Moreover, ^Ethelwold was a privy councillor ofKing Eadgar, and nobly efficient both in word anddeed. Everywhere he preached the Gospel of Christ,according to the exhortation of Isaiah the prophet,Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like atrumpet, and show my people their transgression,His preachingand the house of Jacob their sins.''"176AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTwas much assisted by St. Swithin, whose body hadthen been taken up for re-interment (eodem temporerelevatus), for what JEthelwold brought out in histeaching was wonderfully adorned by St. Swithinand his miracles. Thus it came about, with the con-sent of the King, partly by the counsel and actionof Dunstan, and partly through .ZEthelwold, thatmonasteries were establised everywhere among theEnglish, both of monks and nuns, living under therule, and with abbots and abbesses set over them."u9ilthelwold used to go. round visiting each of themonasteries instituting good customs, admonishingthe obedient, and correcting the foolish with scourg-ing ; and he was terrible as a lion to the disobedientand undisciplined, but to the gentle and humble hewas milder than a dove. He was a father to themonks and nuns, a comforter to widows, a succourerto the poor, a defender of churches, a corrector ofthe wandering, for he accomplished more by hiswork than we are able to relate in words. He wasoften troubled by illness, in his bowels and in hislegs, and had sleepless nights from pain, and in theday, though looking pale, he went about like a manwho was well. He made little use of the meat offourfooted animals or of birds, except at one timefor a period of three months, compelled by his greatweakness and at the bidding of Dunstan, the arch-bishop, and again in the illness of which he died."It was a pleasure to him to be occupied inteaching young men and boys, and to render booksinto English for them, and to exhort them withHence ithumorous talk to rise to better things.came about that many of his disciples became abbotsLIFE OF sETHELWOLD177It happened on aor bishops among the English.time that a certain clerk who had been appointed tocarry a flask for oil took less oil than was required,and even this with the flask he lost on the way.The bishop arriving at the appointed place, foundnothing for the chrism when he wanted it.Theclerk, distressed, went back whither he had comeand found the flask lying full of oil, though it hadnot been half full before." A certain monk, living under him, named Eadwin,moved by a diabolical instinct, stole the purse of aguest, and the bishop, speaking to all the brother-hood in the chapter, said that if any one had takenit, he should return it with his blessing, or place itwhere it would be found.After three days hadpassed, the money not being found, the bishop spokeOur thief would notto all the brothers, saying,return the stolen thing with a blessing, as we com-manded, now let him return it with a malediction,and let him be bound, not only in soul, but also inbody, by our authority. Why more ?The brethrensaid ' Amen/ and behold, there was the thief sittingmiserably bound, his arms fastened to him under hiscope, and he remained thus stupefied till the thirdhour, wondering what he should do.Yet all hisother members he could move, excepting the arms,which the bishop, by the authority given him ofSo the miserable manG-od, had rendered useless.rose up bound, and following the -bishop as if drivento do so, he confessed that he had the purse and hadkept it secretly, but he did not mention that hisThen the bishop said to himarms were bound.gently, as he was wont to speak, you have done well,'12178AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTat least, now, by confessing your fault, though late ;you have my blessing, and immediately his armsButwere loosed, the bishop not being aware of it.he going out joyfully, told in detail of his beingbound and loosed to a brother named Wulfgar, whobade him the rather to hold his tongue about it." When the bishop made a great effort to restorethe old church and ordered the brothers to be oftenhelping the workmen in their labour, it happenedone day while the brothers were standing on thesummit of the roof with the masons, that a monkfell, named Godus, from the top to the bottom. Assoon as he had touched the ground he rose up,having suffered nothing from such a fall, and wentup again to the work where he had before stood,and taking up a trowel finished what he had begun.To what cause is this miracle to be ascribed, unlessit be to him by whose orders he went out to this work ?" A certain monk, named Theodoric, went to thebishop in the middle of the night, desiring by signsto inform him as to some necessary matter, and hefound him reading with a candle, and sharpening uphis aged eyelids with watchful activity ; and themonk stood for a long time admiring the way inThen thewhich he kept his eyes upon the page.bishop rose up from his reading, and the brothertook the candle to try whether he could as diligentlysharpen up his healthy eyes for the reading, as theBut this rashbishop had done his darkening sight.proceeding did not turn out without punishment forhim, for on the following night a person, unknown tohim by sight, appeared to him, saying to him withHow is it that thou hast daredterrible threatening,LIFE OF JETHELWOLD179to approach the bishop in the past night when heAnd saying this he struck thewas reading?'brother a blow on his eyes with his finger, whichpained him for many days, until by making satisfac-tion he had wiped out the fault that he had in-cautiously committed against the holy man."Moreover it happened that as the bishop wasreading at night, in spite of his efforts to watch, hefell asleep, and the lighted candle fell on the page,and burnt, as it lay on it, until a brother coming in,took the burning candle off the book, and found thesparks lying on many of the lines inside the book,and blowing these out he found the page uninjured." I must . candidly confess that it is not easy forme to tell how many things, or what kind of things,the holy ^thelwold patiently suffered on behalf ofmonks, and with monks, and how benign he was tothe studious and obedient, or how he laboured forthe building of the monastery, repairing the church,and building other houses, or how carefully he keptvigil for prayer, and how gently he urged the brethrento confession."But from these few words many things may beimagined that we cannot narrate. He died in thetwenty-second year of his episcopate, on the Kalendsof August, when ^Ethelred was King of the English,and he was buried in the church of the blessedPeter and Paul, which belonged to his episcopalseat. We have heard that miracles were wrought athis tomb, both before his bones were taken up fromhis grave, and afterwards, as to which I mention onlytwo for brevity." There was a certain Oxford citizen180AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTwho had the misfortune of blindness for many years.He was warned in his sleep to betake himself to thetomb of ^Ethelwold, and was told to take with him amonk of Winchester, of whom he had never heardbefore, and that he would lead him to the resting-place of the holy bishop.

Also Alphege, the successor of Saint JEthelwold,has told us that he himself had sent a thief, after hisbeing flogged, into prison, and when the thief hadbeen long under punishment Saint ^thelwoldappeared to him in a dream, and said to him,' Why,miserable one, dost thou lie so long stretched in theBut he, recognising the saint, whom hepillory ?had often seen during his mortal life, answered,' My lord, I am undergoing the punishment I de-serve, and I am tormented in consequence of thejust judgment of the bishop, because I have notceased from my thefts.''

He himself made the wheel called golden,and which is covered with plates of gold, and twelvelamps round the wheel, and numberless little bellsAll these things on the coming ofround the wheel.the Normans were broken up by a certain sacristanof the church, who came from Jumieges, and hecarried off the gold and the silver of this wheel,worth forty pounds, and precious ornaments andmany gold and silver vases, which St. ^Ethelwoldall into Normandy.

Also he imported the rules of St. Benedict fromthe monastery of Fleury.

And when theworkmen were digging in the Thames near themonastery of St. Helen, they found in a sarcophaguslying in deep sand an iron cross that is now calledthe Black Cross."It should be noted that another Life of ^Ethelwoldit is contained in the Annales Ordinisstill exists ;Sancti Benedicti, by Mabillon, and is by Wulstan, amonk of Winchester, and a contemporary of ^Elfric.It has been doubted which of the two Lives is theoldest, but experts have decided that the Life byjElfric is the original, and that with some reminis-cences of Wulstan's own, he has plagiarised ex-tensively from
