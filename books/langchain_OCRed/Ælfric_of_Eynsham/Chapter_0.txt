He in-structed many of the English in the sciences contained inbooks, as he well knew how, and afterwards went across theseas to the wise King Charles, who had great wisdom indivine and worldly matters, and lived wisely.Albinus, thenoble teacher, came to him, and there, a foreigner, he dweltunder his rule, in St. Martin's Monastery, and imparted tomany the heavenly wisdom which the Saviour gave him.There, at a certain time, a priest, Siegewulf, questioned himrepeatedly from a distance, about some difficulties which hehimself did not understand in the holy book called Genesis.Then Albinus said to him that he would gather together allhis questions and send him answers and explanations."AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOT
