CHAPTER XIII.THREE LETTERS ATTRIBUTED TO POPE ALEXANDER III.(1172 OR 1173.)In 1728, Thomas Hearne published at Oxford the BlackBook of the Exchequer [Liher Niger Scaccarii)^ in whichthere are three letters, said to be of Pope Alexander III.—one to the King- of England, one to the Archbishops ofIreland and the Bishop of Lismore, and one to the KingsThe three letters bear the sameand Princes of Ireland.date : Tusculum, the 12th of the calends of October, thatIt is believed that they may beis, the 20th of September.referred to the year 1172—in which case they would havebeen written about a month after the reconciliation atAvranches.I need not discuss the genuineness of the three letters.Although they have come to us only as copies, and havenot seen the light for five hundred and fifty-six years after—A FRIEND or IRELAND.33the time at which they were written ; although they cohttain invectives against the Irish people such as are nevermet with in Acts of the Holy See, at least as regards ex-pression and form ; although they state facts evidentlyfalse or controverted, which would allow the charge oftheir having been surreptitiously or obreptitiously ob-tained, supposing that they were really genuine,— I amwilling to grant that the three letters are true, and I em-ploy them to prove that the false Bull of Adrian still re-mained unknown. 1In point of fact, not one of the letters mentions the Bull,or makes any allusion to it.Alexander III. recommendsKing Henry II. to preserve the rights of the Holy See inIreland, and to extend them, if possible ; but he takes ashis ground that all islands belong more particularly to thePope than continents.a donation ofthe Emperor Constantine, which the Decree of Gratian,published about 1151, had made known everywhere. Thepassage is as follows : —This refersto" And since, as your Highness knows,the RomanChurch has a different right over an island from that whichit has over a vast mainland, we confidently hope fromyour devotedness that, not only will you preserve the rights' Inl a theological sense, a grant is usually said to be surreptitiouslyobtained when something that ought to be manifested is concealed inpetition, and obreptitiously obtained when something false istheasserted.Nothing can be more absurd than to assert that if the Pope, ingranting a dispensation or any other favour, makes no comment on thestatements that accompany the application for it, therefore every oneof those statements is admittedly true.A bull is so called from its leaden or golden seal (bulla), having onone side an image of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and on theother the name of the Pope, and made pendant by a hempen or silkenstring. A brief is signed by the " Secretary of Briefs," and, as it bearsa red wax seal, having an image of St. Peter fishing, it is said to begiven under the Rin^ of the Fisherman.Bulls are issued on mattersof great importance ; briefs on affairs of less serious character.The Roman Bullarium is a large collection of bulls.It has beencompiled by learned, virtuous, diligent men, greatly assisted by others,and accordingly much reliance may be placed on it ; but still it is onlya private collection, not authenticated by the Holy See. How foolishtherefore to argue that because a document is found in the RomanBullarium, it is therefore undoubtedly genuine ! We may say the likeof other valuable works on ecclesiastical matters, for which the HolySee is"in no way responsible.Trans.34POPE ADRIAN IV.,of this Church, but you will also labour to extend them ;and where tliere are none, you will think of establishingthem, in such manner that we may return ample thanks toyour Highness, and you may be seen to offer to God thefirst fruits of your glory and your triumph."The allusion to a donation of Constantine renders thisI have not remarked in the fortyletter very suspicious.volumes of the Roman Bullarium a single certain diploma,declaring that all the islands of the world belong to theUrban II,, it is said, gave the investiture of Cor-Pope.sica to the Pisans, on the ground of the universal sover-eignty of the Holy See with regard to islands ; but theBull attributed to Pope Urban II. on this matter is apocry-phal, as I shall show further on, when I examine the falseBull of Adrian IV., which rests on the same pretension.In the Apocryphal Bull, Adrian ordered the establish-ment of Peter's Pence in all Ireland, such as it existed inEngland. Can anyone imagine that Pope Alexander III.,some twenty years after Adrian, has no knowledge of thispontifical right, and does not recall it when he is recom.mending the King to preserve the rights of the RomanChurch in Ireland ? This proves evidently that the Apocry-phal Bull of Adrian continued unknown as well at Romeas in England and Ireland.The second letter, as I have said, is addressed to the fourArchbishops of Ireland, and the Bishop of Lismore, whowas perpetual Legate to the Holy See. Now, Pope Alex-ander founds the obligation of obedience to the King ofEngland not, assuredly, on a donation of Pope Adrian, butsolely on the voluntary acknowledgment and spontaneoussubmission that the bishops and princes have testifiedtowards this prince.The chronicler of Anchin, who continued Sigebert, saysthat King Henry II. failed in Ireland.I have quoted asage in full : — " Henry, King of England, rising up withfragrnent of the annalist above.
