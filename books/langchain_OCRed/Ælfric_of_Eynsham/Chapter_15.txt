The Bull waspassed over in silence, even at a time when Henry II.would have had the greatest interest in producing it, andavailing himself of it.It was only a good many yearsdeathofthat of PopeLouis VII., and about thirty yearsAdrian IV., that Giraldus Cambrensis, Chaplain of theEnglish Court, first inserted the false Bull in his historyof the conquest of Ireland.after theafterAfter the death of Louis VII., there was no longer anyinconvenience in speaking of a Bull from Adrian. How-ever, before producing it, it was necessary, first of all, toexistence, and gradually to prepare publicrevealopinion for the reception of the apocryphal document.itsBehold a difficult question : was John ofSalisburycharged to announce the Bull?Is he really the author ofthat chapter in his Metalogicus which says that, at his re-quest. Pope Adrian IV. granted the Bull?Let us first see if Salisbury's antecedents place hirri be-yond the reach of a suspicion of complicity in the fraud.I have said (Chapter VIII.)Salisburyspent a great many years out of England, and that thepublication of his Polycraticus, in 11 59, drew On him theattention of Thomas Becket, then Chancellor, who attachedhim to his service, and gave him several employments.that John ofIt is generally believed that he had been secretary orchancellor to Theobald, the predecessor of Saint ThomasIn point of fact, wein the primatial See of Canterbury.remark in Salisbury's voluminous correspondence a verylarge number of letters that he wrote to Pope A. in thename of Archbishop T.

We have no other g-uarantee that thelast chapter of the Metalogicus, written perhaps at a timewhen it was a matter of interest to make people believethat in the closing- years of Theobald, say ii6oor 1161,Salisbury wrote that chapter in his work which mentionsthe donation of Ireland to King Henry II. and the Bull ofPope Adrian IV.What is certain is that Becket attached Salisbury byseveral employments, and, from the time of his nominationto the Archbishopric of Canterbury, took him as secretary.I do not like to see that Salisbury (letter 150) confidied tohis friends that he neg^lected no means of moderating- thezeal of the prelate, warning- him that his ardour wouldcause him to lose the friendship of the King.l However,he did not abandon his protector in the hour of disg-race.He shared proscription with him, and sought a refuge inAfter five years of exile, he rejoined ThomasFrance.Becket in England, and was, a little while later on, awitness of his tragic death.
