CHAPTER VITEACHING OF ,ELFKIC ON HOLYCOMMUNIONTHE teaching of .ZElfric as to the Holy Communionhas been the main doctrinal point of attraction inhis writings, since the days of the Eeformation.At that time Archbishop Parker edited the Homilyon the Easter Eucharist with his signature andthose of thirteen of his suffragans, with the objectof showing that the doctrine of transubstantiation,which the Eeformers rejected, had not been held inOther writers of thethe Anglo-Saxon Church.Church of England, among them Dr. Hook, havefollowed in the wake of Archbishop Parker.Dr.Lingard, seeing the question from the Koman side,endeavours to show by quotations from the Homiliesof Bede, that ^llfric's view was not the usual one.But the Homilies of JElfric were written on pur-pose to be used as sermons to the people by theclergy of the Anglo-Saxon Church, and they werededicated to Sigeric, the Archbishop of Canterbury.We may therefore certainly regard the doctrinethey contain as set forth by authority.Definitions beyond what had been previously86^ELFRIC ON HOLY COMMUNION87givenventured upon had beenregarding theEucharist by Paschasius Kadbert. He was a monkof the Abbey of Corbey, and after being master ofthe monastic school, became Abbot in 844.About831 he composed a treatise on the Eucharist forthe instruction of some of the younger monks, inone of the daughter houses of the Abbey of Corbey,and in 844 he presented a second edition of this" On the Lord's Body andtreatise under the title,Blood," to the King, afterwards the Emperor, CharlesIn this, while he lays stress on the re-the Bald.ception being spiritual and not carnal, he expressesthe contradictory opinion that the bread and winecease to exist in their own nature, and are changedinto the same Body and Blood of Christ that wasa doctrine which wasborn of the Virgin Maryeventually known and sanctioned in the EomanThere had been inChurch as transubstantiation.the Eastern Church writers who had gone nearly asfar as to say this ; but they had not laid it downPaschasius; and had left theas definitelydoctrine more involved in mystery.asPaschasius says: "Though the figure of breadand wine remain, yet these are altogether a figure,and after consecration we must believe thatthere is nothing else than the flesh and blood ofChrist." He then proceeds to define what thisflesh and blood are, not leaving them in theobscurity and mystery suggested by the sixth88AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOT"chapter of St. John's Gospel, and regardless of ourIt is the Spirit that quickeneth ; theLord's words,flesh profiteth nothing," he asserts that this certainlyis no other flesh than that which was born of Marylandsuffered on the cross and rose from the tomb, and he" As real flesh was created fromexplains it as follows :the Virgin without paternal generation, by the opera-tion of the Spirit, so by the operation of the sameSpirit the same body and blood of Christ is mysticallyconsecrated from the substance of bread and wine/'Eabanus Maurus became Abbot of Fulda in 8 2 5 , andArchbishop of Mentz in 847. In the following wordshe repudiates the teaching of Paschasius Eadbert :" Certainpeoplelately, having wrong ideasabout the Sacrament of the body and blood ofthe Lord, have said that this is the body itself andblood of the Lord which was born of the VirginMary, and in which the Lord suffered on thecross, and rose from the tomb ; in reply to whicherror, writing as fully as we could to Egilus theAbbot, we have explained what is rightly to bebelieved about the body itself. How is it right forthis flesh of Christ to be eaten, if it was born ofMary and suffered on the cross, and rose from thetomb, especially as that flesh of Christ rising fromthe tomb was so glorified that it could no longer inany way be eaten ?"But it was from the teaching of Ratramnus thatJElfric derived the expressions which he uses as to^ELFRIC ON HOLY COMMUNION89Eatramnus was athe doctrine of the Eucharist.monk and priest atCorbey, the monastery ofPaschasius himself, and afterwards became Abbot ofOrbais.

Let us consider the font of Holy Baptism .in that font, if one considers what the bodily sensessee, there is seen the element of water, which issubject to corruption, and is not capable of washinganything but the body ; but through the consecra-tion of the priest the power of the Holy Ghost isadded, and it is made able to wash not only bodiesbut also souls, and by spiritual efficacy to removespiritual stains." The sea and the cloud (i.e. those referred to in1 Cor. x. 1-4) conveyed the cleansing of sanctifica-tion not in respect of their outward bodily naturebut in respect of that sanctification of the HolyGhost which they invisibly contained.Christ saidto His disciples, who received His words not withunbelief but in faith, though they did not grasphow to understand them, 'Does this make youstumble ? What then if ye should see the Son of92AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTMan ascending where He was before ?v ;as though to' Think not that My flesh or My blood is to besay,corporally eaten or drunk by you, or that it hasbeen divided or is to be divided into pieces, forafter My resurrection ye shall see Me ascend intoheaven with the completeness of My whole body andThen shall ye understand that My flesh isblood.not to be eaten by believers as faithless people think,but that bread and wine, really converted in mysteryinto the substance of My body and blood, are tobe taken by believers.'" From all which has so far been said it has beenshown that the body and blood of Christ which arereceived by the mouth of the faithful in the Church,visible nature ; but inare figuresrespect of invisible substance, that is the power ofthe divine Word, they are really the body and bloodof Christ.in respect of" Now we must examine the second question pro-pounded, and see whether that body itself whichwas born of Mary and suffered and died and wasburied, which sits at the right hand of the Father,is that which is daily taken by the mouth of thefaithful in the Church, in the mystery of theSacraments. ... St. Ambrose says that in thatmystery of the body and blood of Christ a changeis made wonderfully because it is divine, and ineff-ably because it is incomprehensible. ... As regardsthe substance of the creatures, they are after con-secration what they were before.Bread and winethey were before, and after they have been conse-crated, they are seen to remain in the same natureON HOLY COMMUNION93...There has been then an inner change by(species).the mighty power of the Holy Ghost; and it isthis which faith beholds, which feeds the soul,which supplies the substance of eternal life.Those things which are seen are not in nature(species) but in power the body and blood ofChrist. ... St. Ambrose distinguishes between theSacrament of the flesh and the external reality ofthe flesh (veritate) inasmuch as he says that Hewas crucified and buried in the external reality(veritate) of the flesh which He took of the Virgin,but that the mystery which is now celebrated inthe Church is the Sacrament of that real flesh inwhich He was crucified ; he openly teaches thefaithful that that flesh in respect of which Christwas crucified and buried is not a mystery but anexternal reality of nature (veritas naturae), butthat this flesh which now contains the likeness ofthat flesh in mystery is not flesh by nature (inspecie) but sacramentally (sacramento), since indeedas to nature (in specie) it is bread, but by way of. TheSacrament it is the real body of Christ. .difference is great which distinguishes the body inwhich Christ suffered and the blood which He shedfrom His side when hanging on the cross, from thisbody which is daily celebrated by the faithful, sothat it may be a mystery of that blood by whichthe world was redeemed.."It is further to be considered that in the breadthere is a figure not only of the body of Christ,but alsoof the body of the people believing inHim. ... As that bread is taken to be the body94AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTof Christ in mystery, so also in mystery the membersof the people believing in Christ are signified. Andas that bread is called the body of believers notcorporally but spiritually, so also it must be under-stood to be the body of Christ not corporally butSo also water is ordered -to be mixedspiritually.with the wine which is called the blood of Christand one is not allowed to be offered without the. the water in the sacrament bears theother .If then the wine when con-image of the people.secrated by the office of the ministers is corporallyconverted into the blood of Christ, the water alsowhich is mixed with it must be corporally converted. What-into the blood of the believing people. .ever signification there is of the body of the peoplein the water is taken spiritually ; whatever there-fore is indicated by the blood of Christ in the winemust be taken spiritually. ....." Let it not be thought that in the mystery of theSacrament the body and blood of the Lord Himselfare not taken by the faithful, for faith receives whatit believes, not what the eye sees.It is spiritualfood and spiritual drink, spiritually feeding thesoul and bestowing the life of eternal satisfaction."A SERMON ON THE SACRIFICE ON EASTER DAY,BY JSLFRIC (Catholic Homilies, p. 267, etc.)" The people of Israel ate the flesh of the lambat their Easter-tide, when they were delivered, andwe now partake spiritually of Christ's Body, and^ELFRIC ON HOLY COMMUNION95drink His Blood, when with true belief we partakeThe time they held for sevenof the holy housel.days, with great veneration, was their Easter-tide,in which they were delivered from Pharaoh, anddeparted from the country, so likewise we Christianmen hold Christ's resurrection as our Easter-tide,during these seven days, because, through His passionand resurrection, we are redeemed, and we shall bepurified by partaking of the holy housel, as ChristHimself said in His Gospel,Verily, verily, I sayunto you, ye have not life in you, unless ye eat MyFlesh and drink My Blood.

Now certain men have often inquired, and yetfrequently inquire, how the bread, which is prepared96AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTfrom corn, and baked by the heat of the fire, canbe changed to Christ's body ; or the wine, which iswrung from many berries, can by any blessing bechanged to the Lord's Blood ? Now we say to suchmen, that some things are said of Christ typically,It is a true and certain thing thatsome literally.Christ was born of a maiden, and of His own willsuffered death, and was buried, and on this dayarose from death. He is called bread typically, andlamb, and lion, and whatever else.
