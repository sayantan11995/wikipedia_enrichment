CHAPTER XXXI.I'MAXCU'AHOX OF Tllli IRISH.Taught by lony experience that it was impossible to over-come the Irish in matters ol religion, the English Govern-ment at last understood that it should grant Emancipation,But this great change was notwith full religious liberty.wrought in a day ; the English yielded only little by little,and when compelled by necessity. ^Since the conquest, Ireland had been subjected to iniqui-tous treatment. The conquerors began by despoiling thenatives of a great part of their lands. The next step was,by ill treatment, to drive them into rebellion, so as to havea plausible pretext for depriving them of what was left.Protestantism made no proselytes among the old Irish ;the only Irishmen who embraced it were the descendants ofthe English who settled in Ireland since the conquest.But, intead of allowing those men who had beensopitilessly robbed the exercise of the religion of their ances-tors, the English banished the priests from their churches,and gave their goods to Protestants. Some Irishmen hadstill preserved lands ; their fidelity to the Stuarts served asCromwell first, and after-a pretext for their spoliation.wards William HI., greedily confiscated whatever had notbeen already confiscated, so that there remained in thehands of Catholics only a tenth part of the lands of Ireland.To complete the evil, the new proprietors were not slowin returning to England—leaving their estates in the handsof middlemen, who sublet them in various portions to theunfortunate peasants at enormous rack-rents, and on con-ditions so hard that Russian serfs were less to be pitied.In 1793, the English Parliament passed a Bill that freed} Hence O'Connell's celebrated maxims, " England's difficultyis Ireland's opportunity," and, " We must take justice by instal-These maxims were the practical application of thements."words of one of O'Connell's warmest friends and supporters, the" Ireland is our secondMost Rev.

The author showsthat the gross income of Great Britain is reckoned at iifteen hundredand thirty millions, and that of Ireland at seventy millions.Then,deducting £12 per head for average support of population, thetaxable income of Great Britain is about £^0 a head, and that ofthe Briton and the Irishman were to beIreland £t, a head.taxed with equal fairness, each Briton should pay ten times asmuch as each Irishman. ...

An ardentpatriot, of giant mind and sympathetic heart, he laboured for manyyears to procure " Repeal of the Union." The pride of his country-men, he was regarded as an uncrowned king, and was followedwith unbounded confidence. He was a great advocate for moralforce, though some people believe that moral force shows itselfbetter by a well organised policy of passive resistance than byspeeches in the House of Commons ; and even the Times has ad-mitted that passive resistance may become " more troublesomethan armed rebellion."However, as far as can be judged at present,it seems a much wiser course for the Irish people to rally round theirparliamentary representatives, and to pull well with them.Itis to be feared that no other plan would work ; and great disunionAfter manymight be caused by advocating some crude scheme.a struggle for faith and fatherland, O'Connell died in T847 ^t Genoa,on his way to the Eternal City, bequeathing " his soul to God. hisheart to Rome, and his body to Ireland." He is buried in Glas-nevin Cemetery (near Dublin), where a noble monument—a roundtower 160 feet high, surmounted by a cross eight feet high—doeshonour to his memory. The chief street in Dublin, one of thefinest in Europe, is called O'Connell Street, that his sentiments,his aspirations, and his lifelong endeavours may never be forgottenby Irishmen.Thanks to Father Eugene O'Growney and the Gaelic League,a wonderfully strong national spirit, such as would have delightedO'Connell, has been awakened in the country during the pastfew years by the Irish Language Movement !Never, perhaps,134popr: Adrian iv.,anddistinctions,The Duke of Welling'ton proposed, and the two Housesof the English Parliament carried, a Bill which abolishedrecognised equality in politicalcivilrights, with a few exceptions.Before being able to en-gage in public functions.

We should not forget what is oftenseen in history, that the dialects of people who once spoke the samelanguage, have, by imperceptible changes and for want of pruning,at last become different languages, no longer intelligible to all.About a century ago, the Welsh language was nearly extinct,btit by a vigorous effort it was revived, and is now in a most flourish-About three-fourths of the people of Wales useing condition.the Welsh language in the daily intercourse of life.There arelarge districts in which a word of English is never heard fromIn 1887, there were seventeen weeklyJanuary to December.newspapers in the Welsh language.
