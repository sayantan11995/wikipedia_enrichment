CHAPTER XII.TH'EOATHTHAT HENRY TOOK IN THE CATHEDRAL OFAVRANCHES IS DECISIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE BULLATTRIBUTED TO POPE ADRIAN IV.(1172.)After waiting- five months, Henry II., at the end ofMarch, received in Wexford a favourable message. Heset out forthwith on Easter Monday, crossed England andthe Channel with great haste, and reached Normandy.In the Cathedral of Avranches—the Sunday previous tothe Assumption—before the legates, bishops, barons, andpeople—his hand on the Book of the Gospels—he solemnlyswore that he was innocent in word and deed of the murderof the Archbishop.The silence observed in this oath with regard to Irelandshows that Pope Adrian had not given the island to theKing of England, and, consequently, that the ApocryphalBull was not yet invented.In point of fact, Henry, doing homage for the kingdomof England to the Holy See, and placing his kingdomunder the Pontifical Sovereignty, would not have neglectedto join Ireland with it, if this land had lawfully belonged tohim by Pontifical concession ; the double offering wouldhave facilitated the reconciliation, the absolution, the re-habilitation of the prince.The following is the formula of the oath, such as Baro-it, from documents in theand - MuratorigiveniusVatican : —" I, H., swear on these Holy Gospels of God that I didnot premeditate the murder of Saint Thomas, that I didnot know of it, and that I did not command it ; that, onreceiving information of this crime, Ifelt a sorrow asacute, a sadness as great, as if I had heard of the murderof my own son.But what I cannot excuse in myself is"—A FRIEND OF IRELAND.3Ithat he was put to death by occasion of the resentment andanger that I had conceived against the holy man.
