CHAPTER IINTRODUCTION ON EAELY MONASTICISMsuccessiveBEFORE entering on the career of JElfric, monk andabbot, it will be well to place before the readersome noticeof early monasticism in the BritishIsles, and to touch upon itsstagesprevious to ^Elfric's time, so that we may under-The mon-stand the background of his personality.asteries of the West began as centres of missionarylife, but when that need had been superseded by aparochial ministry, they were mainly devoted tostudy, prayer, and manual labour. Many of them,however, had sadly deteriorated before the revivalof religion under Dunstan and his pupil uEthelwold,the teacher of ^Elfric.We are not accustomed in the present day toassociate the idea of monasteries with missionarywork.to throw ourselvesIt requires an effort2AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTback into an age in which these were closelyunited together.There are two thoughts that may assist us. Wemay say, without impropriety, that the Monks ofthe early ages were the true Salvation Army of theirOrday, and the monasteries were their barracks.again we may take an illustration from History.When the conquering kings of the mediaevaltimes wished to unite to their kingdom a regionwhich they had invaded, they established a chain offortresses, or castles with garrisons, to enable themto dominate a country which was far from beingentirely subjugated ; as, for instance, in the case ofEdward I. and his castles in Wales. A similar planwas adopted in stillearlier times, to assist thepeaceful warfare of the Cross.Monasteries were founded as fortresses of theof Christ werespiritual life, where the soldiersdisciplined, and drilled in the devotion and thelearning which should prepare them fortheirAnd wheninroads into the surrounding paganism.needing rest from the conflict, the monks couldreturn thither to recover breath, and to recruit theirexhausted strength by times of quiet devotion.Further, as the castlesof the warrior kingsexisted with a view to the enforcement of order, sothe still higher purpose ofChurch life waspromoterecognise, as the monks did,tothese fortressesofcivilisation.

theearly monasteries were very humble buildings.InIreland a few wattled huts, or cells of stone shapedlike beehives, with a small church of the simplestcharacter were surrounded by a fence.Outside itwere the barn and cattle shed.In these lowlyabodes it was that the early Celtic monks attaineda degree of learning which astonished the world;there they studied and copied, and painted in coloursof remarkable harmony, the service books, andGospel books which are still, in the specimensthat are left, among the wonders of the past.An introductory word must not be omitted as tothe two great lines on which the monastic settle-In Ireland the abbots werements were founded.more powerful than the bishops, in many cases ;

communitylife was subsequently developed, and there can beno doubt that the prevalence in the West ofassociated monks (though ofcourse there stillexisted hermits and solitaries), was largely dueto the belief that the opportunities of Christianbrotherhood were more in accordance with theteaching of our Lord, and more helpful to progressin the Christian life, than entire absorption in thecare of one's own soul.This great idea of seeking, in seclusion from theworld, personal holiness in a brotherhood of mutuallyhelpful souls, attained its first wide development inthe West through the Benedictine communities.INTRODUCTION7Benedict was born at Nursia, in Italy, in 480.He was sent to Borne at the age of twelve, underthe care of a nurse, as seems to have been usual inAfter two years he retired to a cavethose days.near Subiaco, having been shocked by the wickednessof the boys in Rome.
