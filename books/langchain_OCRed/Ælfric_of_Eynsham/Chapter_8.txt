CHAPTER VIIITHIRD SEEIES OF HOMILIES(Lives of the Saints,* vol. i.)THE metre of Anglo-Saxon poems is well describedby Stopford Brooke inhis History of EnglishLiterature. He tells us that their metre is unlikeany modern one, without rhyme, and without anyfixed number of syllables. Its essential elements wereaccent and alliteration."Every verse is divided into two half verses by apause, and has four accented syllables, while thenumber of unaccented syllables is indifferent. Thesehalf verses are linked together by alliteration. Thetwo accented syllables of the first half, and one ofthe accented syllables in the second half, begin withthe same consonant, or with vowels which weregenerally different one from another.This is theBut to give a greater freedom there isformal rule.often only one alliterative letter in the first halfHere is an example of the usual form :verse."'And cfeaw-cMas: on rfaege weorthethWinde geonds&wen.'' And the dew-downfall : at the ^ay-break isWinnowed by the wind.'1 Skeat's Translation.141142AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOT"This metre was continually varied, and wasof unaccentedchiefly by the additioncapable,syllables, of many harmonious changes."JElfric was very fond of using alliteration, and thechief instance of this is afforded by the mode inwhich he wrote the Lives of the Saints.To this work he prefixed' a Latin and an Englishpreface.The Latin one begins as follows :." This book have I also translated from the Latininto the usual English speech, desiring to profit othersby building them up in the faith, whenever they readthis narrative, as many, that is, as are pleased tostudy this work, either by reading or hearing itread ; for I think it will not be unwelcome to theFor I call to mind that in two formerfaithful.books I have set forth the Passions or Lives of thesaints whom our nation celebrates by honouringtheir festival, and it has now pleased me to set forth,in this book, the Passions as well as the Lives ofthose saints, whom not the people at large, but themonks honour by special services. .. Let it notbe considered a fault in me, that I turn sacrednarrative into our own tongue, since the request ofmany of the faithful shall clear me in this matter,particularly that of the governor JSthelwaerd, and ofmy friend ^Ethelmser, who most highly honour mytranslations by their perusal of them ; neverthelessI have resolved at last to desist from such labourafter completing the fourth book, that I may not beregarded as too tedious.".^LFRIC'S THIRD SERIES OF HOMILIES 143The Anglo-Saxon preface is as follows :"JElfric humbly greeteth ealdorman JSthelwaerd,and I tell thee, beloved, that I have now collected inthis book such Passions of the Saints as I have hadleisure to translate into English, because that thou,beloved, and ^Ethelmser earnestly prayed me for suchwritings, and received them of my hands for theconfirmation of your faith by means of this historywhich ye never had in your language before. Thouknowest, beloved, that we translated in the twoformer books the Passions and Lives of the saintswhich the English nation honoureth with festivals ;now it has seemed good to us that we should writethis book concerning the sufferings and lives of thesaints whom monks in their offices honour amongstthemselves." We say nothing new in this book, because it hasstood written down long since in Latin books, thoughlaymen knew it not. ... I pray now in G-od's name,if any man desire to transcribe this book, that hecorrect it well according to the copy ; and set downtherein no more than we have translated.Farewellin the Lord."QUOTATION UPON DRUNKENNESS(Lives of the Saints, vol. i. p v359)"Gluttony maketh a man eat and drink before thetime, or again to take too much in food or in drink.This destroyeth both soul and body, because itbringeth upon the man much sickness, and bringethhim to death through immoderate drinking; itdestroyeth also the soul, because he will often sin,144AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTwhen he himself knoweth not how he behaveth, byreason of his fiendish drink."As a contrast to this he describes Temperance (inEnglish, moderation) :" This is that a man be moderate, and do not take toomuch, either in food or drink, neither take his mealsthey have it,before the time.but the discreet man ought to keep to his mealtime,and then also with discretion, observe his regularcustom ; thus he may overcome gluttony."Beasts eat as soon as7THE VIRTUESPATIENCE AND SPIRITUAL JOY(Lives of the Saints, vol. i. p. 361)" In patientia vestra possidebitis animas vestras":" In your patience yethat is, in the English speech,shall verily have your souls in keeping." "TheHeavenly Wisdom saith, that 'anger dwelleth in thebosom of a fool,' that is when he is too hasty ; forthe all-ruling Judge judgeth ever with mildness, andwe ought by patience to overcome anger."Of spiritual joy he observes that it means :" That a man rejoice in God, amidst the sorrows ofthis hard world, so that we may not be despairingin misfortunes, nor again rejoice overmuch in pros-perity ; and if we lose the transitory things of thisworld, then should we know that our dwelling is nothere, but is in heaven, if we hope in God.Thitherwe should hasten from this distress, with spiritualjoy, thus shall the sorrow be utterly overcome byour patience."^ELFRIC'S THIRD SERIES OF HOMILIES 145Of perseverance he remarks (" Instantia boni" It is a prolouged disgrace if our life beoperis ") :useless here."BIRINUS 1(Lives of the Saints,2 vol. ii. p. 133)At that same time also a certain bishopCame from the city of Eome, named Birinus,To the King of the West Saxons, called Cynegils,Who was yet a heathen, as was all the land of the WestSaxons.Birinus indeed came from Rome,By desire of the Pope who was then in Rome,And promised that he would execute God's will,And preach to the heathen in the Saviour's Name,And the true faith in far lands.Then he came to Wessex, which was as yet heathen,And converted to God the King Cynegils,And all his people to the faith with him.Then, it happened that the faithful OswaldThe King of the Northumbrians had come to Cynegils,And took him to baptism, fain of his conversion.Theft the kings, Cynegils and OswaldGave to the holy Birinus the city of Dorchester,For a bishop's see and he dwelt therein,Exalting the praise of God, and guidingThe people in the faith by his teaching for a long timeUntil he happily departed to Christ,And his body was buried in the same city,Until Bishop Hedda after carried his bonesTo Winchester, and with honours deposited themIn the old Monastery where men honour them yet."31 Came to Wessex 635.2 See Bede, Eccl.

As a specimen of the former we mayabridge the history of St. Euphrasia, or Euphrosyne,born in the province of Alexandria.It affordsa remarkable example of the horror of marriagewhich among monastic persons justified untruthful-There was anness for the purpose of avoiding it.honoured man of rank named Paphnutius who livedin the fulfilment of the commandments of G-od,and his wife was equally virtuous.For a longtime they had no child, but at the prayer of anabbot a daughter was granted them. When shewas twelve years old her mother died." Then the father instructed the maiden in holywritings and godly readings, and in all earthlywisdom, and her fame and wisdom and learningwere known through the town."She had many suitors;at last, one worthierThenthan the rest was accepted by her father.the father took her to the abbot who had prayedfor her birth, and asked his blessing on the in-tended marriage.They stayed several days, duringwhich she observed the devout life of the brothers.Before they left, Paphnutius brought his daughterto receive a parting blessing from the abbot.She^LFRIC'S THIRD SERIES OF HOMILIES 147fell at his feet and said,Father, pray for me,that God may beget my soul unto Himself." Thenthe abbot extended his hand and blessed her and"said :" Lord God, Thou Who knewest Adam ere he wascreated, vouchsafe to have care of this Thine hand-maid and that she may be a partaker of the heavenlykingdom."So after these words they returned home. AndPaphnutius being friendly to monks would oftenask one in and require him to bless his daughter.One day when her father was out, she had a longtalk with a monk from this same monastery, whohad come intending to call on Paphnutius, andquestioned him about the devotions of the brothers.Noticing her earnestness the monk advised her to" Wed thyself to Christ,abstain from matrimony.Who for these transitory things can give thee theShe answered readily, andheavenly kingdom."asked, "Who will cut off my hair?"So it wasarranged that when her father went to the minsterto see the abbot, a monk should come to prepareFearing that her father wouldher for reception.find her if she entered a nunnery, she put on theclothes of a man, and so disguised, she became amonk in the monastery that her father had visited,and was called Smaragdus.She told the abbotthat - she was a young man, and that she hadcome from the King's household, and he did not148AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTrecognise her as the maiden for whose birth hehad prayed, and accepted her for .his brotherhood,and gave the supposed youth into the charge ofan older monk for instruction.

And Paphnutius came and be-moaned the loss of his daughter. Then at last, beingaware that she was dying, she made herself knownto him, and her spirit passed away, and he fell sense-less on the floor. And after her burial Paphnutius.ELFRIC'S THIRD SERIES OF HOMILIES 149entered the monastery, and gave most of his posses-sions to it, and lived ten years in the cell where hisdaughter had been.

ALBAN, MARTYR 1(Lives of the Saints, vol. i. p. 415)"There was a heathen emperor named Diocletian,who was chosen to be emperor over all the earth,though he was a destroyer of men, two hundredand eighty- six years after Christ's Incarnation ;and he reigned twenty years, a cruel murderer,so that he killed, and bade kill,all the Christians whom he could find out,and burned churches, and robbed the innocent ;and this impious persecution spread unceasinglyover all the earth fully ten years,until it came also even to England,and there killed many who believed in Christ.One of these was Alban, the noble martyr,who was likewise killed in that persecutionfor Christ's faith, even as we shall tell (you) here.In those days came the murderous persecutionto England from the wicked emperor,and the murderers seized the Christians everywherewith exceeding fury ; then a priest escaped from themwho ran secretly to Alban's house,and there lay hid from his fierce persecutors,and Alban received him, though he was not baptized.Then began the priest, forasmuch as he loved God,to sing his offices, and fast strictly,and day and night to praise his Lord,1 A.D. 305.Bede, Eccl. History', book i. chap. vii.^ELFRIC'S THIRD SERIES OF HOMILIES 157and meanwhile to teach the true faithto the honourable Alban, until he believedin the true God, and renounced heathenism,and became verily a Christian, and exceeding full of faith.Then the priest dwelt with the honourable manuntil the magistrate who persecuted the- Christiansdiscovered him there, and with great wrathcommanded him to be fetched before him speedily.Then came the messengers to Alban's house,but Alban went out unto the persecutorswith the priest's cloak, as if he were he,and would not betray him to the wicked persecutors.He was thereupon bound, and brought straightwayto the impious judge, where he was offering to his godsthe devilish sacrifices, with all his associates.Then became the judge fiendishly angry,as soon as he beheld the steadfast martyr,because he had received the fugitive priest,and given himself up to be slain for him.Then he bade men lead him to the heathen sacrifice, and saidthat he himself should receive the heavy punishmentwhich he had meant for the priest if he could have taken him,unless he quickly submitted to his shameful gods;but Alban was not affrighted by his fiendly threats,because he was girded about with God's weaponsunto the ghostly fight, and said that he would notobey his host, nor bow to his idolatry.Then asked the judge immediately, and said'Of what family art thou, or of what rank among men?'Then Alban answered the wicked man thus:'What concerneth it thee, of what family I may be?but if thou desire to hear the truth, I tell thee quicklythat I am a Christian, and will ever worship Christ.'The judge said to him: 'Tell me thy name,without any delay, now that I thus ask.'The champion of God said to the murderer thus,'I am hight Albanus, and I believe in the Saviour,Who is the true God, and made all creatures ;to Him I pray, and Him will I ever worship.'158AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOT'Your sacrifices to the gods,The murderer answered the glorious man,'If thou wilt have the felicity of the everlasting life,then thou must not delay to sacrificeto the great gods, with full submission. 3Alban answered him :which ye offer- to devils, cannot help you,nor profit your cause, but ye shall receive as your meedeverlasting punishments in the wide-reaching hell.'Lo ! then the judge became fiendishly irate,and commanded men to scourge the holy martyr,weening that he might bend the steadfastness of his mindto his (own) forms of worship by means of the stripes;but the blessed man was strengthened by God,and bore the scourging exceeding patiently,and with glad mind thanked God for it.Then the judge perceived that he could not overcomethe holy man by the severe tortures,nor turn (him) from Christ, and commanded them to killhimby decapitation, for the Saviour's name.Then the heathen did as the judge commanded them,and led the Saint unto his beheading ;but they were delayed a long while at a bridge,and stood still until evening by reason of the exceedingcrowdof men and of women who were stirred up,and came to the martyr, and went with him.So then it fell out that the unbelieving judgesat unfed in the town until evening,without any meal, fasting against his will.Lo ! then Alban would hasten to death,and went to the stream when he could not go over thebridge,and looked up to heaven, praying to the Saviour,and the stream thereupon dried up before him,and made a broad way for him, even as he had desiredof God.Then the executioner, who was to kill him,was touched by that miracle, and threw away his sword,^ELFRIC'S THIRD SERIES OF HOMILIES 159and ran quickly, as soon as they had come over thestream,and fell at his feet with full faith,desiring to die with him rather than to slay him.He was then united, with resolute faith,to the holy man whom he was to have beheaded ;and the sword lay there shining before them,and not one of them would readily slay him.Then was there nigh at hand to the holy mana pleasant hill, adorned with plants,with all fairness, and eke full smooth.Then went Alban quickly thither,and straightway prayed God that He would give himwaterupon the hill, and He did so.Then ran the well-spring at Alban's feet,That men might understand his power with God,when the stream ran from the steep hill.He was then beheaded for the Saviour's name,upon the hill, and departed to his Lordby victorious martyrdom, and with true faith ;but his slayer might not live in full health,because that both his eyes burst out of him,and fell to the earth with Alban's head,that he might understand whom he had killed.They beheaded afterward the faithful soldierwho would not behead the holy man,and he lay beside Alban, believing in God,baptized with his blood, and departed to Heaven.Afterward, when the executioners came to their lord,and relatedwonderfulthesignswhich Alban hadwrought,and how he was blinded who had beheaded him,then he bade them stay thepersecution, and spakereverentlyof the holy martyrs, whom he could not turnfrom God's faith by the terrible torments.In that same persecution were [also] slainAaron and Julius, and many others,160AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTboth of men and women, widely throughout England,killed by tortures for Christ's faith,and they departed victoriously to the true life.Then the persecution ceased, and the Christians cameout of the woods, and out of the wastes, where they hadbeen hidden,and went amongst men, and restored Christianity,and repaired churches that were .wholly ruined,and dwelt there in peace with true faith.Then they built likewise a worthy churchto the holy Alban, where he was buried,and there frequently were miracles performedto the praise of the Saviour Who liveth ever in eternity.This was done before that strife camethrough Hengest and Horsa who defeated the Britons,and Christianity was again dishonoured,until Augustine re-established it,according to the instruction of Gregory, the faithful Pope.Be glory and praise to the benevolent Creator,Who delivered our fathers from their foes,and disposed them to baptism by means of His preachers.Amen."Nov. 20.PASSION OF SAINT EDMUND, 1 KING ANDMARTYR 2(Lives of the Saints, vol. ii. p. 314)"A certain very learned monk came from theSouth, over the sea, from Saint Benedict's Stow, inthe days of King ^Ethelred, to Archbishop Dunstan,three years before he died, and the monk was calledAbbo. Then they were in conversation till Dunstantold him about saint Edmund, even as Edmund's1 A.D. 870.2 Skeat tells us that Mlfiic derived the life of St. Ednmnd fromAbbo of Fleury.^SLFRIC'S THIRD SERIES OF HOMILIES 161itto King ^thelstan, whensword-bearer toldDunstan was a young man and the sword-bearer avery old man. Then the monk put all this story ina book, and afterwards, when the book had come tous, within a few years, we turned it into EnglishThis monk Abbojustwithin two years went home to his minster, andwas almost immediately appointed abbot in thatsame minster.it stands here-after.as"Edmund the blessed, king of the East Angles,was wise and honourable, and ever glorified,by his excellent conduct, Almighty God.He was humble and devout, and continued so steadfastthat he would not yield to shameful sins,nor in any direction did he bend aside his practices,but was always mindful of the true doctrine'(If) thou art made a chief man, exalt not thyself,but be amongst men as one of them.'He was bountiful to the poor, and to widows even likea father,and with benignity guided his peopleever to righteousness, and controlled the violent,and lived happily in the true faith.Then at last it befell that the Danish peoplecame with a fleet, harrying and slayingwidely over the land, as their custom is.In that fleet were their chief men,Hingwar and Hubba, associated by the devil,and they landed in Northumbria with their ships,and wasted the land and slew the people.Then Hingwar turned eastward with his ships,and Hubba was left in Northumbria,having won the victory by means of cruelty.Then Hingwar came rowing to East Angliain the year when JElfred the setheling was one and twentyyears old,ii162AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOThe who afterward became the renowned king of the West-Saxons.And the aforesaid Hingwar suddenly, like a wolf,stalked over the land and slew the people,men and women, and witless children,and shamefully tormented the innocent Christians.Then soon afterward he sent to the kinga threatening message, that he must bow downto do him homage, if he recked of his life.So the messenger came to king Edmund,and speedily announced to him Hing war's message.'Hingwar our king, keen and victoriousby sea and by land, hath rule over many peoples,and has landed here suddenly even now with an army,that he may take up his winter-quarters here with his host.Now he commandeth thee to divide thy secret treasuresand thine ancestors' wealth quickly with him,and thou shalt be his under-king, if thou desire to live,because thou hast not the power that thou mayst with-stand him.'So then king Edmund called a bishopwho was handiest to him, and consulted with himhow he should answer the savage Hingwar.Then the bishop feared for this terrible misfortune,and for the king's life, and said that it seemed best to himthat he should submit to that which Hingwar bade him.Then the king kept silence and looked on the ground,and said to him at last even like a king :'Behold, thou bishop, the poor people of this landare brought to shame, and it were now dearer to methat I should fall in fight against him who would possessmy people's inheritance.' And the bishop said,'Alas, thou dear king, thy people lie slain,and thou has not sufficient forces with which thou mayestfight,and these seamen will come and will bind thee alive,unless thou save thyself by yielding to him.'Then said Edmund the king, full brave as he was :' This I desire and wish in my mind,^LFRIC'S THIRD SERIES OF HOMILIES 163that I should not be left alone after my dear thanes,who even in their beds, with their bairns and their wives,have by these seamen been suddenly slain.It was never my custom to take to flight,but I would rather die, if I must,for my own land ; and almighty God knoweththat I will never turn aside from His worship,nor from His true love, whether I die or live.'After these words he turned to the messengerwhom Hingwar had sent to him, and said to him un-dismayed :'Verily thou wouldest now be worthy of death,but I will not defile my clean handswith thy foul blood, because I follow Christ,Who hath so given us an example, and I will blithelybe slain by you, if God hath so ordained.Depart now very quickly, and say to thy cruel lord ;Edmund the king will never bow in life to Hingwarthe heathen leader, unless he will first bow,in this land, to Jesus Christ with faith.'Then went the messenger quickly away,and met on the way the bloodthirsty Hingwarwith all his army , hurrying to Edmund,and told that wicked man how he was answered.Hingwar then arrogantly commanded his troopsthat they should, all of them, take the king alone,who had despised his command, and instantly bind him.Then Edmund the king, when Hingwar came,stood within his hall mindful of the Saviour,and threw away his weapons, desiring to imitateChrist's example, Who forbade Peterto fight with weapons against the bloodthirsty Jews.Then those wicked men bound Edmund,and shamefully insulted him, and beat him with clubs,and afterward they led the faithful kingto an earth-fast tree, and tied him theretowith hard bonds, and afterwards scourged hima long while with whips, and ever he called,between the blows, with true faith,164AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTon Jesus Christ ; and then the heathenbecause of his faith were madly angry,because he called upon Christ to help him.They shot at him with javelins as if for their amusement,until he was all beset with their shots,as with a porcupine's bristles, even as Sebastian was.When Hingwar, the wicked seaman,saw that the noble king would not deny Christ,but with steadfast faith ever called upon Him,then he commanded men to behead him, and the heathendid so.For while he was yet calling upon Christ,the heathen drew away the saint, to slay him,and with one blow struck off his head ;and his soul departed joyfully to Christ.'Worthy is the place for the sake of the venerable saintthat men should venerate it, and well provide itwith God's pure servants, to Christ's service,because the saint is greater than men may imagine.The English nation is not deprived of the Lord's saints,since in English land lie such saintsas this holy king, and the blessed Cuthbert,and saint .ZEthelthryth in Ely, and also her sister,incorrupt in body, for the confirmation of the faith.There are also many other saints among the English,who work many miracles, as is widely known,to the praise of the Almighty in Whom they believed.Christ showeth to men, through His illustrious saints,that He is Almighty God Who causeth such wonders,though the miserable Jews altogether denied Him,because they are accursed, as they desired for themselves.There are no wonders wrought at their sepulchres,because they believe not in the living Christ ;but Christ manifesteth to men where the true faith is,since He worketh such miracles by His saintswidely throughout the earth; wherefore to Him be Gloryever with His Heavenly Father, and with the Holy Ghost,for ever and ever. Amen."^ELFRIC'S THIRD SERIES OF HOMILIES 165King Cnut endowed and established a monasteryat Bury St. Edmund's, in place of the secular churchthat had previously existed there, and in expiationof the martyrdom of which the Danes had beenguilty.
