Of course it findsexpression in different ways. We cannot be surprised if Sir HoracePlunkett, in his book Ireland in the New Century, remarks: "Uponthe England that sowed the wind was visited a whirlwind of hostility fromthe Irish scattered throughout the globe." This writer has no small shareof blame to lay on the Irish for their defects, but surely many allow-ances ought to be made for a people so heavily and so unjustly handi-capped for centuries. The Irish know pretty well what was the causeof those defects, for which none have suffered more than they ; andperhaps in their sufferings they have shown more moral fibre than theirAlmost every path to prosperity was closed againstpitiless oppressors.them. To say nothing of bad laws, wealthy Protestants were unwillingto invest their capital in Irish labour, and few Catholics, of any wealth,knew how to employ labour in the development of trade, to profitof improvements in machinery, or to engage in safe business on anHence, the masses of the people, struggling to earn aextensive scale.poor subsistence from land, could not rise above poverty and misery.Such was not the case in other countries, where the upper and lowerclasses were in good accord.Besides, every nation of Europe, exceptIreland, had consuls or agents abroad, who could give informationregarding the products of their respective countries, and thus find newmarkets for them.To ask now that Irish history should be buried in oblivion ismuch the same as to ask that England should be unmolested in herShe has indeed made some con-various methods of fleecing Ireland.cessions to Ireland, but to say that the England of to-day is not theEngland of former days, or even of fifty years ago, sounds ratherstrange, while we hear ministers of the Crown coldly telling us that theGovernment has no intention of granting a Catholic University, or whilewe look at that monstrous anomaly, Trinity College, existing to thisday in our midst, with its ;f55,ooo a year, derived chiefly from the con-fiscated property of Catholics. Is this to govern with the consent of the" with a full and con-governed, or, as a Lord Lieutenant lately said,stant regard to the traditions of the country " ?It must, however, be admitted that, with some very regrettable les-sons, savouring rather much of " amateurishness," Sir Horace has givenus a large number of useful ones.

The Eng-lish were settled along the eastern and southern coasts.By English we understand a medley of adventurers fromdifferent parts of England, Wales, and Guienne—menwho, despairing of any fortune in their own country, re-lied upon their swords to make it elsewhere.Theyhad sworn fidelity to the Crown of England, but this fidelityof Agriculture and Technical Instruction, which was founded in :90c,with an annual income of /i65,ooo, derived in almost equal parts fromIrish and Imperial sources, and with a starting capital of /2oo,ooo.Practical men like him, diligent students of social problems at homeand abroad, might do much to improve a country, as Belgium, Holland,Switzerland, Denmark, etc., have been improved.But if the Depart-ment would justify its existence, it should merit the confidence of theIt should not be turned into an engine of ascendency, itIrish people.should not be made a new means of multiplying situations for a smallsection of the community, and the public should be supplied with a fullrecord of its annual expenditure.In short, it should be an honestinstitution for the general welfare of Ireland.The great changes with regard to local government that have takenplace within the last few years, may be considered as some partialmeasure of Home Rule.But, alas ! how far are we still from havingIt is a most lamentable reflection thatobtained anything like justice !while the population of Ireland between 1871 and 1904 has fallen bymore than a million, the taxation (for British purposes) in the sameperiod has risen from £6,923,402 to £9,748,500, that is by nearly threeIn the present year (1905) it is estimated atmillions, or 70 per cent.In 1894, when it was only ^7,568, 649, the Financial^10,378,000.Relations Commission decided that this amount was at least 2| millionsIf restitution were to be made by England, what an enor-too much.mous sum would be due to us !It seems that during 1903 there were£14,000,000 of taxation, imperial and local, raised in Ireland, and thatlarge suras thereof were most wastefuUy expended. The cost of DublinCastlegovernment went up from £5,970,0:0 in 189510 £7,214,000 in 1902.Yet Belgium, which has four times the trade of Ireland, and a muchlarger population, is governed at about half the cost.

How unreasonable and unfair is such a misapplication of thepublic revenues ! No wonder that the Most Rev, Dr. Walsh, Arch-bishop of Dublin, addressing a large audience lately, should point outthe grounds of complaint that Irish Catholics have against the Govern-ment for the highly unsatisfactory manner in which it has treated theUniversity question during the last nineteen years. They had first, hesaid, the assurance of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach in 1885 ; secondly, in1889, the promises of Mr. Balfour in reply to resolutions of the hier-archy ; thirdly, in the following month, Mr. Balfour's promises to Mr.Parnell; fourth, in the December of the same year, the promises con-tained in Mr. Balfour's great speech at Partick ; fifth, I^ord Cadogan'sspeech at Belfast in 1896 ; sixth, the assurances given by Mr, GeraldBalfour in the House of Commons; and seventh, the assurances con-tained in Lord Cadogan's speech to the deputation of the Senate of theRoyal University, which waited on him in connection with the appoint-Yet all has come to nothing.ment of the late University Commission.How quickly would these matters be settled, and how many millionsof money would be saved or profitably spent, if we had an Irish Parlia-ment, of which, according to many great authorities, we were illegallyand unconstitutionally deprived !Indeed the history of the means by which the Union was carried,shows that it was not the deliberate choice or act of the Irish people,but more like a great swindle effected by the enemies of Ireland.Ifjustice has any place among men, so grievous a wrong ought to berighted with all speed. As the learned Bishop of Limerick has re-marked : " Aliens can never rightly rule any people. No matter whattheir intentions or dispositions, they are working against nature whenthey take into their own hands the power and the responsibility whichthe manifest Providence of God shows should be exercised by the inha-88POPE ADRIAN IV.,who knew no other law than their own interest.Unable todeny that they had been aggressors against the indigenousIrish, they regarded them as their natural enemies.Allthose whom they found within the limits of their district,they reduced to the most abject servitude, and the othersthey continually harassed by military excursions.In 1275, King Edward wrote to the Bishops of Ireland,and besought them to labour for the restoration of peace.What is there in Ireland to condemn her tobltants of every nation.a servitude that would not be heard of in Belgium, or Holland, orDenmark, or amongst any other people ?"The Rev. P. J. Dowling, CM., Cork, writing some time ago in theIrish Ecclesiastical Record, mentioned a number of books that would beinstructive for those interested in Irish industries, and desirous to knowsomething of industrial progress in foreign lands. He is a great admirer" In somewhat over thirty years," he says, "theirof the Germans.system of technical training has made such a change in the industriallife of that country that it is only rivalled in swiftness, completeness,and beneficence by what we read in fairy tales.Starting with a popu-lation mostly agricultural, Germany to-day is turned into a vast hive ofindustries, where the farmers cannot supply the wants of the workers."Many persons will be glad to learn from him that " the more remark,able technical and commercial colleges, the greatest industries, are tobe found in the Rhineland, which, as every one knows, is the mostCatholic part of Germany." He speaks of the Exhibition of Dussel-dorf, where the Catholics are seven to one, as an extraordinary success—one of the most wonderful exhibitions that the world has ever seen.The machinery hall covered five acres ; and the main industrial hall,seven. He says that wages in Germany have increased three, and, insome cases, four-fold; and that " the German workman of to-day, withhis retiring pension at 65, is the envy of his comrades the world over."If this important article were re-published among the penny booklets ofthe Catholic Truth Society, it would be very useful in Ireland. Wemay confidently expect that the tide of emigration will be stemmed,when people see that they can prosper well enough at home, thoughtheir standard of living is not high, without exposing themselvesto the heavy toils and unhealthy climates of foreign countries.A series of small books on all the different trades and other in-dustries that might be largely developed in Ireland, would alsoNot the least advantage of it would be that itbe very useful.would help young people to select an occupation for which theyseemed to have most taste and talent.In treating of any subject,the author should give the names of the chief tools used, and asimple explanation of the manner of using them.Every lessonor chapter might be limited to a page or two.An industry fully developed may come to something very great.Thus, the immense, magnificent shirt-factories everywhere to beseen in Derry, in which machinery is turned to the highest account,show what a fortune-making business this must be. In like manner,we learn that a distinguished Prelate, lately visiting the Deaf andA FRIEND OF IRELAND.89" Rex venerabilibus patribus archiepiscopis et episcopisQualiter terra praedicta, perterrse Hibernise, salutem.discordias et guerras ibidem diu habitas, depauperata ex-istit fide perpenditis oculata ; unde cum super hoc sumus,nee immerito, anxiati animo et turbati ; et totis desideriisaffectamus quod hujusmodi controversise et guerrse paci-ficentur, vobis et fide et dilectione quibus nobis teneminimandamus, rogantes quatcnus, de consilio justitiarii nostriDumb Institution at Cabra, Dublin, was told by the good DominicanSister in charge of the lace manufacture among the girls (over 200)Ofthere, that it would lake four years tn complete the orders on hands.course, we may presume that the purchasers were notified of thisdelay, and' that, satisfied with the prospect of excellent work,though done by poor girls both deaf and dumb, they expressed theirwillingness to wait.It would seem that, after the land of Ireland, the water might bemade a source of innumerable advantages. The quantity of water-power unemployed is very great, equal to more than two million horse-power; whereas in England and Scotland scarcely a drop is lost.It iscalculated that the expense of water-power in working machinery isonly about one-fourth that of steam-power, so that if it takes ;^2o toproduce one-horse-power for a year by steam, it takes only £^ to pro-duce the same by water.

And even bogs, it seems, may be turned to accountFor, according to Monsignor MoUoy, Rector ofin like manner.the Catholic University, who is a great authority on scientificmatters, there is an absolutely unbounded source of energy in thebogs of Ireland, which is capable of being brought into action byelectrical engineering ; so that the Bog of Allen alone could supplymotive power more than sufficient to work all the railways of Ireland.What a reduction in rates of transit would then follow !At presentwe are told that turf-inould required in Dublin can be broughtmore cheaply from Germany than from Galway, and that, onaccount of carriage, coal from Roscommon is dearer in Galway thancoal from England.Another point, not unworthy of attention, is the necessity among usof acquiring good bu.siness habits.

This shows that the nationalKings retained their dignity.(See Rymer, II., io5i.)The Irish chiefs did not swear fidelity to the King ofEngland. The King employed request or invitation, notcommand, when he wished for any service.At the begin-ning of a war with Scotland, Edward II. asked the twenty-six kings who were at the head of Irish tribes to send himtroops ; but they made no account of his petition. Rymerhas published the King's letter, dated 22nd of March, 1314.(T.
