We note, in passing, thatEnglish policy sometimes swarms with contradictions.Atthe present day, England is full of Irish people.If theywithdrew, the manufactories and other industrial estab-lishments could not be carried on.(Rymer, x., 467.)Henry VII., in a patent of 1494, bears witness to therevolts that frequently occurred : " Universos et singulostarn Anglicos rebelles quam Hibernicos dictse terras nostrse,eamdem terram nostram in futurum invadentes, et ipsamterram nostros subditos ejusdem depraedare, guerrare seualio modo destruere sive devastare nitentes," etc. (Rymer,xii., 558.)Thus, very far from making conquests, the Englishwere hardly able to defend their own territory.During the War of the Two Roses, the Irish of the Palewere deeply attached to the House of York.Henry VII.turned his attention to the pacification of the colony. Heconferred the nominal government of it on his second son,Henry ; but as this prince was only four years of age,Poyning was given him as Lieutenant.The revolt ofO'Hanlon, an Irish prince, soon obliged this ofificer to takeAt his approach, the indigenous Irish retired tothe field.their woods ; and thence, by sudden and frequent sallies,caused great damage to their adversaries.—A FRIEND OF IRELAND.OQroyniiigs assembled a Parliament, which made severalstatutes to deliver the lower classes from vexatious taxes,to reduce the power of the great lords, to maintain Eng-lish influence, and to secure the gfood administration ofEnglish territory.
