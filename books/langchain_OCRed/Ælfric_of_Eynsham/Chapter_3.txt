He explainedthe Latin books to them in English, and " exhortedthem with pleasant words to better things."Hispupil y3$lfric, shows in his "colloquy" with boys amost kindly spirit, and it cannot be doubted thatthe lesson of ^Ethelwold's geniality had sunk intoIt is evident from that colloquy, ashis mind. 11 Dean Hook has an amusing criticism on this record.Lives ofthe Archbishops, vol. i. p. 441 : "Though a popular master, wemay doubt whether he was a good one, for one of his practices wasto turn Latin books for them into English. We have heard of theuse of cribs, but this is perhaps the only instance of their beingprovided by the master." On this we may remark that in the4546AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTwell as from what we read of Winchester, that thelife of boys in the school of a monastery was byno means unhappy or depressing, and, in contrastto what we have often found in recent days in ourown public schools, it appears that they were wellNor were the monks without interest in life.fed.The books copied in the Scriptorium of the monasterywere beautifully illuminated, and when ./Ethelwoldput up a new organ, a music-book was compiledexists, and which gives the cadenceswhich stilland tones used in the services as conducted in thetenth century../Elfric's writings may best be studied as thosethat he wrote while a simple monk, and thosecomposed when he had become an abbot.Thereis clear evidence that he did not attain this dignitytill the year 1005.From Winchester .ZElfric went to Cernel inDorsetshire, now called Cerne Abbas, where wasa monastery to which King ^Ethelred had given acharter.He was sent thither by Jilfeah,1 or Alphege,Bishop of Winchester, at the request of ^Ethelmaer,early ages books were costly, and probably JEthelwold construedthe Latin sentences to the boys, and then made the boys repeatthe Latin and the English to him.This was not a bad method.1 The same prelate that was murdered when archbishop.

He himself tells us his motive :"The people have no books that teach in theirown language the truth of God, save those thatThere are indeed manyKing Alfred translated.English books that teach error, and the unlearnedin their simplicity esteem them great wisdom."Moreover, the clergy had little power of preaching,and Mlinc desired to supply them with Englishsermons that they might read in Church, foundedon the best teachers of old days.Of these hementions, amongst others not named, sixAugustine,Jerome, Gregory, Bede, Smaragdus, and Haymo. 1Smaragdus was Abbot of St. Mihiel, a monastery in the dioceseof Verdun, in the eighth century. He wrote commentaries on theScriptures, and sermons. Haymo was Bishop of Halberstadt aboutthe middle of the ninth century. He composed commentaries from148AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTHe aimed at making their teaching suitable forordinary and uneducated hearers, in plain language,not by mere translation, but by rendering the sense.He puts his authors forward as the importantpersons, and keeps himselfin the background,but at the same time he moulds the substanceof their writing into the form most suitable forhis English hearers, often adding racy and impres-sive applications of his own.The Catholic Homilies were in two volumes ;each intended to afford sermons for a year, theywere dedicated to Sigeric, who became Archbishopof Canterbury in 990, and died in 995.The next literary effort to which JElfric devotedhimself was the composition of a Latin Grammarin the English language, to which he added aglossary of words in common use.One mighthave imagined that grammars for teaching boysLatin would always be brought out in the nativelanguage of the scholars, whatever that might be,with only the necessary words and quotations inBut the earliest Latin Grammars had beenLatin.written in Italy, in days when Latin was eitherthe vernacular tongue or still well known andSo extraordinary has been the conservatismused.of educationists that because Eoman boys had theirgrammars in Latin, the custom was maintained forthe works of the Fathers on almost every part of Scripture.was also a Haymo of Canterbury who wrote commentaries,ThereLIFE OF /ELFRIC49Only quite recently have English publicages.schoolboys been freed from the needless difficultyof learning the elements of Latin through rulesthegiven in that language only.years so distant from our own, about 995, JSlfric'scommon sense led him to compose for Saxon boysa grammar in their own language.Knowing thatthis departure from the prevailing custom wouldexpose his work to criticism, he thought it prudentto apologize in his Preface.Already, inTRANSLATION OF PART OF THE LATIN PREFACE TO^ELFKIC'S GRAMMAR AND GLOSSARY(It was from this work that dBlfric was called" Grammaticus ")"I, ^Elfric, as one of slight wisdom, have chosenthese extracts from the smaller and from, the larger1 and have translated them intowork of Priscian,your own language for you little boys of tenderyears ; that after having read through the eightparts of speech of Donatus,2you may be able toreceive both languages into your tender minds,I knowwhile you progress towards higher studies.that many persons will blame me for having been1 Priscian was born towards the end of the fourth century atCsesarea.

He then addresses,in a few lines of Anglo-Saxon, these two distinguishedlaymen as follows :".ZElfric humbly greeteth earldorinan ^thelweard,and I tell thee, beloved, that I have now collected52AN ANGLO-SAXON ABBOTin this book such Passions of the Saints as I havehad leisure to translate into English, because thatthou, beloved, and JEthelmser earnestly prayed mefor such writings, and received them at my hands,for the confirmation of your faith by means of thishistory, which ye never had in your languagebefore," etc. etc.1These Lives of the Saints were probably writtenabout 996 or 997.It was about the year 997 that ^Elfric translatedsome portions of the Pentateuch and of Joshua forJEthelweard, stating in his Preface that " Mlhic,the monk humbly greeteth ^Ethelweard the earl-dorman. Thou didst pray me, friend, to translate theBook of Genesis from Latin into English.Thenit seemed to me wearisome, to accede to thee in thismatter, and thou saidst that I need only translatethe book as far as to the account of Isaac, son ofAbraham, because some other man had alreadytranslated the book for thee from that point toIt is therefore probable that ^Elfricthe end."accordingly incorporated an already existing workIn connection with ^Elfricin the further portions.having made translations of books of the Bible forlaymen, it has been well remarked that he hadevidently no aversion such as prevailed among the1 This .ffithelweard is supposed to be identical with the JEthel-weard who wrote a Latin Chronicle, which still exists, but thesentence above quoted does not look as if our JEthelweard under-stood Latin.See Appendix A.LIFE OF yELFRIC53clergy later on, to the Scriptures being read by thelaity ; and he desired only to suppress those partsof the Old Testament which might perplex themby encouraging polygamy, or which were lessprofitable as regards their practical lessons.After these translations ^Elfric brought out anepitome of the Book of Job, and added renderingsOne of his last works whileof Esther and Judith." was a set of directions orCanons for the Clergy, written for the use of" a humble brotherstillBishop Wulfsige.The pastoral letter to clergy which Wulfsige,Bishop of Sherborne, asked ^Elfric to write for hisuse was prefaced by a short personal address, con-taining a very plain-spoken warning :" We have not dared to write anything aboutthe episcopal office, because it belongs to you toknow in what way you should be an example to allby the best practices, even as it is yours to knowhow to exhort your subordinates with constantadmonitions to seek the salvation which is in JesusI say, nevertheless, those things which youChrist.ought again and again to say to your clergy, and inregard to which you should show their remissness,since through their frowardness the canon law, andthe religion and doctrine of Holy Church areFree your mind, therefore, and telldestroyed.them what ought to be regarded by the priests andministers of Christ, lest you yourself perish like-wise, if you are accounted a dumb dog.
