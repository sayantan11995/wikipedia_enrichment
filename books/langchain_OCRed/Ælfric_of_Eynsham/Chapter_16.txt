At this moment it would be more properto weep than to write ; and I learn by sensible experiencethat the whole world is subject to vanity. We have hopedfor peace, and lo ! trouble and tempest burst on Toulouse,and everywhere rouse the English and the French ; andKings, whom we have seen united, pursue each otherwithout a moment's intermission.Moreover, the death ofthe Lord Pope Adrian, which has alarmed all the peoples ofChristendom, has caused still greater grief in our England,of which he was a native, and evoked more abundant tears.Good people deplore this loss, but no one should lament itmore than I.In fact, although he had his mother and auterine brother, he loved me more than them. He declared,in public as well as in private, that he had a greater affec-tion for me than for any other person in the world. Hehad formed such an opinion of me that he was delighted toopen his heart and conscience to me, as often as oppor-tunity offered. Though Roman Pontiff, he was pleased tohave me as guest at his table ; in spite of my reluctance, herequired that one plate and one cup should be in commonAt my request he gave Ireland to the illus-between us.trious King of England, Henry II., to be possessed byFor aillhereditary right, as his letters prove to this day.,"46POPE ADRIAN IV.islands, in virtue of a very ancient law, are considered tobelong to the Roman Church, through a donation of Con-More-stantine, who founded and endowed this Church.over, Pope Adrian sent by me a gold ring, adorned with amost beautiful emerald, by which investiture with theright of governing Ireland should be made ; and this ringis preserved by order in the public archives of the Court.I should never be done if I were to relate all the virtues ofBut that which pierces all heartsthis illustrious Pontiff.most is the schism, which, in punishment of our sins,afflicts the Church, so great a Pontiff having been taken.

The part that mentions the siege ofToulouse imitates a part in the preface of the Polycraticus.If John of Salisbury, about this period, entered the serviceof Becket, could he be at the same time chancellor andsecretary to Theobald?Second Observation.In the preface of the Metalogicus,Salisbury speaks of the duties that he fulfils in regard tothe ecclesiastical causes of all England, by order of hislord ; but he does not name the Archbishop, he does notpassage from the prologue : —" Placuit itaque sociis, utsay that he speaks of Theobald.Here, in short, is thehoc ipsum tumultuario modo dictarem : cum nee ad sen-tentias subtiliter examinandas, nee ad verba expolienda,studium superesset, aut otium.Necessariis enim occupa-tionibus vix ahquid amplius deducebatur quam refectionishora, vel somni : cum ex mandate Domini mei, cui deessenon possum, sollicitudo totius Britannia, quod ad causaseoclesiasticas, mihi incumbat.leifamlliaris, et curiales nugae, studium excludebant : amico-Ad haecsollicitudoA FRIEND OF IRELAND.47rum interpellatio me fere totum absorbuerat. .. Et quialogici suscepi patrocinium, Metalogicon descriptus estliber.".All this agrees very well with the first days of SaintThomas, before the conflict with Henry II.Accordingly,the Metalogicus would have been written about that period.I do not see any motive that could have induced theauthor to repeat in Chapter XLII. what he had said in thepreface, namely, that he was absorbed in his duties, over-Besides, whatwhelmed with the cares entrusted to him.is clear in the Prologus becomes ambiguous in ChapterXLII.Sollicitudo totius BritannicB,quod ad causas ecclesiasticas.This is the exercise ofIn Chapter XLII.,metropolitan or primatial jurisdiction.on the contrary, there is no longer any question of theaffairs of England ; there is mention only of ecclesiastics,which seems confined to persons: Omnium ecclesiasticorumsollicitudo. We should say that it was a mere glance overthe moral conduct of the clergy.The preface says :What is truly new in Chapter XLII. is the name ofTheobald, which is not in the Preface.As it is very doubtful whether Salisbury was ever inthe service of Theobald, this circumstance increases sus-picion against Chapter XLII.ofvisitwriter relatesthe Lord PopeThird Observation. What thethefamiliarity with which Pope Adrian treated him is trulyunworthy of the pontifical majesty.Salisbury expressedhimself more modestly in the Polycraticus : —" I remem-ber that I set out for Apulia, toAdrian, who had admitted me to a special familiarity.Iwith him at Beneventum for nearly threeremainedWhile we were oftenmonths.differentmatters, as is usual among friends, and he questioned mefamiliarly and diligently, to know what men thought ofhim and of the Roman Church, I took the libertyofopenly representing to him what I had learned in variousprovinces."Salisburyhere wander from the respectconstantly due to the Sovereign Pontiff. But it is quite adifferent case in Chapter XLII.(Poly., 1. 6, c. 24.)does notWho will believe that Pope Adrian took pleasure insaying publicly that he loved Salisbury more than anyspeakingof;48POPE ADRIAN IV.,Other person in the world—more than his own mother orhis own brother?It is known that the Pope eats alone.

Now this circumstance is contra-dicted by the Apocryphal Bull, which mentions a letterIn any case, it is very strange that thefrom the King.donation of a kingdom should have been obtained by aprivate individual, who had no official character.Thefalse Salisbury of Chapter XLII. does not give the leasthint in the world that Henry II. had charged him withthe mission of soliciting, in his name, authority to invadethe land of Ireland, and to compel the inhabitants to re-cognise him as their lord and master. On the other hand,the Apocryphal Bull does not name Salisbury ; it men-,tions no ambassador who has made a petition in the nameOne might believe that the affair had allof the King.been arranged by correspondence.Fifth Observation.Salisbury, in the -PoZycraticMS, fixesthe time of his interview with Adrian IV., when saying<that he met him at Beneventum.Adrian IV. sojourned atBeneventum for seven months, from November 21, 1155,to July 10, 1 156.If the concession in regard to Irelandiwas made during the three months that Salisbury spent atBeneventum, how explain the silence that he kept aboutit in the Polycraticus, published three years afterwards,'A FRIEND OF IRELAND.49in 1 159? On the other hand, if the donation of Irelandis to be referred to another journey of Salisbury's, theauthor of Chapter XLII. ought so much the more justlyto have fixed its time, as the Apocryphal Bull is withoutdate in Giraldus Cambrensis, who, it seems, was the firstOther historians and compilers haveto publish this Bull.put : Datum Romw, etc. According to this, the Bull couldnot be referred to the sojourn of Adrian at Beneventum,nor to the journey that the Polycraticus makes known.Sixth Observation.The authorof Chapter XLII.announces a letter of Pope Adrian IV. regarding Ireland ;but he did not know its tenor, he never had it beforeIf he had known it, he would not have assertedhis eyes.that the Pope gave Ireland to the King of England andhis successors by right of succession and inheritance :Ad preces meas illustri Anglorum regi Henrico secundoconcessit et dedit liiberniam jure hereditaria possidendam,sicut litercB ipsius testantur in hodiernum diem.

The sending- of a ring as a signof investiture is a thing unexampled in history, if thePope does not at the same time appoint a delegate to per-form publicly the ceremony of the imposition of the ring.The pseudo-Salisbury tells us gravely that Pope Adriansent a gold ring, in order to proceed to the investiture :Annulum quoque per me transmisit aureum, smaragdoOptimo decoratum, quo fieret investitura juris in gerenda^idemque annulus in curiali archive publicoHibernia,I look for the Pontifical delegate.custodiri jussus est.It certainly was not Salisbury, a simple priest.The Apocryphal Bull itself does not speak of a ring orring except inI find no trace ofof investiture.Giraldus Cambrensis, whom I have quoted above.thisEighth Observation.Hereditary investiture is withoutexample in the Pontifical diplomatique of the twelfth cen.. tury. The Pope, granting that investiture should pass toheirs and successors, required a renovation and confirma-tion of it at each change of reign or pontificate.TheNormans of Naples and Sicily submitted to the commonlaw : their diplomas are met everywhere in the annals ofBaronius and other historians.According to the pseudo-Salisbury, Adrian IV., treating the Normans of Englandmuch more favourably, would have granted perpetual in-vestiture by the magic virtue of a ring kept in the royalarchives of WinchesterNinth Observation.Salisbury was too enlightened tosay that the Emperor Constantine founded the RomanChurch ; for foundation goes back to Jesus Christ, or tothe times of the Apostles.It is not even quite true thatthis Emperor endowed the Roman Church :in the veryera of the persecutions, it owned property, which, confis-cated under Diocletian, was restored by order of Con-stantine.If John of Salisbury really wrote in 1160 that all islandsbelong to the Holy See, he did not perceive that this1 To preserve uniformity of translation, the words of this sentenceare borrowed from the translation given by Cardinal Moran, No, 1amone; the Documents at the end.Trans,^s Regeitdq. ?—A FRIEND OF IRELAND.5^maxim would apply directly to England.
