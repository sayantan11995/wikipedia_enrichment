CHAPTER XXIX.CONFISCATION OF LANDS IN IRELAND.Elizabeth,In 1560, under the reign ofthe ProtestantParliament met in Dublin.It was decided that Irelandshould be reformed according to the model of the AnglicanChurch ; but the nobility and the people detested thischange, and the new laws were not enforced, except inplaces where they could be maintained by the bayonet.A FRIEND OF IRELAND.121Of all the native chiefs, the man who most alarmed theGovernment was Shane O'Neill, eldest son of the Earl ofTyrone. The old Irish respected and obeyed him as thechief man of the island.In 1565, he took part in some actsFrequent losses obliged him to seekof open rebellion.refuge among the Scotch of Ulster, enemies alike of Irishand English ; and this Irish prince was basely murderedby his new friends, at the instigation of Pierse, an EnglishThe name, as well as the title, of O'Neill wasofficer.to resumeblotted out for ever by an Act of Parliament ;it was declared an act of high treason. The lands of Shaneand his followers, comprising half of Ulster, were confis-cated for the benefit of the Crown.But this reduction of Ulster did not bring back peace.The restless feeling of the chiefs of the country, both Irishand English, continually drew them into local wars ; andtheir attachment to the Catholic Faith made them enemies, to the Government, which proscribed their religion.In-all the provinces. The usualsurrections broke out inpunishment was the confiscation of the lands of the delin-quents ; but it was easier to pronounce this punishmentthan to put it into execution.A new plan was proposed to Queen Elizabeth—that ofcolonising the confiscated districts with English peasants,who, having an Interest in the soil, would be obliged tocombat the old Irish without expense to the Crown.A trial of it was begun in 1572. Immense grants weremade to some of the adventurers.The Earl of Essexoffered to colonise with 1,200 men the district of Clanna-By a contract made between Elizabethboy, in Ulster.and him, it was agreed that the expense should be bornein equal portions by them. ^This new plan of colonisation was regarded with horrorby the natives both of Irish and English origin.Theysaw the fate that was in store for them.Several chiefs,either in person or by messenger, implored the help OfCatholic powers for the defence of their property and theirreligion.

A considerable number of the old inhabitantsrather than abandon their birth-place, consented to holdfrom strangers the lands that came to them from theirancestors. 11 The following note is from the Introduction to a " Brief Descrip-tion of Ireland, 1590," published by the Archaeological Society, Dublin,.1S41 :—" Her Majesty was bent on peopling Munster with English settlers,and letters were written to every county in England to encourageyounger brothers to become ' undertakers ' in Ireland, a name appliedto the settlers on account of their being obliged to undertake to observecertain conditions enjoined by the Queen.'' The plan devised for the plantation of Munster was, to divide theforfeited lands into seignories; and to require each undertaker ior. 12,000acres to plant eighty-six families upon his estate, viz.His own family to have .... 1,600 acresOne chief farmer ...Two good farmers .... 600400,,,,Two other farmersFourteen free-holders, each 300 acresForty copy-holders, each 100 acresTwenty-six cottagers and labourers4004,2004,00080012,000,," And so proportionably for smaller seignories."The inducements to settle in Ireland were very great.

On the contrary, I find him to say :" In Ireland almost the whole population, whether of English or Irishorigin, was leagued in open or clandestine hostility against the Englishgovernment."—" The O'Neill was celebrated in every district as thesaviour of his country; and the whole of the indigenous population,and many of the chieftains of English origin, arose in arms to assertthe independence of their country."It is possible that a French edition may have been tampered with.Asa general rule, our learned author, who often quotes Dr. Lingard,is exceedingly correct in his views regarding Ireland, especially whenwe consider that he is a foreigner.Trans.124POPE ADRIAN IV.,handful of Protestants to deprive a whol-e people of theirIf the laws were observed, it was only inreligious rites.the towns of the garrison. The news of Elizabeth's deathwas immediately followed by a restoration of the ancientworship.The violent abolition of Catholic worship, and the finesinflicted on those who were absent from the ProtestantChurch on Sunday, were not the only blows of whichthe Catholics of Ireland had to complain. The law obligedevery person to take the oath of supremacy, if he wishedto practise at the bar, or to become a magistrate, or toobtain investiture or possession of feudal lands.This law was often relaxed. Sometimes it seemed to fallinto desuetude. But the Irish always knew that such favourcame only from toleration, and that they were at the mercyof the Government, and of every perfidious or interestedinformer. During the greater part of the reign of James I.the laws were executed with some indulgence, but this in-dulgence was only accidental, and even when it took place,it did not proceed from any just idea of equity.It arosefrom a sense of weakness, and a conviction thatmoment for another course was not yet come. ^theIn 1605, James issued a proclamation, commanding allCatholic priests to quit Ireland under pain of death, andrequiring the chief inhabitants to attend the ProtestantSome great families of the country cried outservice.against the unlawfulness of this ordinance, and asked thatliberty of worship should be allowed them ; but the peti-^ A certain author, to whom we have several times referred, takesa mere passing remark from a letter (in Spicil.

Now, who does not see that the nameless writer of this letter hasno claim to be regarded as an exponent or a representative of the viewsheld by the Old Irish ?It was always the endeavour of the English toobtain belief for Adrian's Bull ; but the Old Irish in general knew toowell what to think of it.Their confidence in the Pope, their devotionto the Holy See, never failed for a single day. No doubt many of theAnglo-Irish followed their example.— Trans.—A FRIEND OF IRELAND.1 25tioners were arrested, and lodged in the Castle.

Mean-while, about a hundred thousand acres were colonised ;and the vigour of the measure, joined with the amalgama-tion of a new race, helped to keep in awe those turbulentspirits who had so often despised the authority and thepower of the English Government.Such was the plan.Under the reign of Charles I., relig'ious persecution be-The Irish then held a generalcame doubly intense. '^' Mr. Lecky, though no great friend of Ireland, felt himselfbound as an honest historian to write thus of Ireland in the latterpart of the sixteenth century :" The slaughter of Irishmen was looked upon as literally theNot only men, but even the womenslaughter of wild beasts.and children who fell into the hands of the English were deliberatelyand systematically butchered. The sword was not found efficient.But another method was found much more efficacious.Yearafter year, over a great part of all Ireland, all means of humansubsistence was destroyed, no quarter was given to prisoners whosurrendered, and the whole population was skilfully and steadilystarved to death. The pictures of the condition of Ireland atthis time are as terrible as anything in human history."We may indeed with all truth say, that during the last sevenhundred years, Ireland has presented innumerable scenes for theproper description of which no historian can find words, no paintercolours.Again, speaking of the early part of the seventeenth century," It had become clear beyond all doubt to the nativeMr. Lecky says :population that the old scheme of rooting them out from the soilwas the settled policy of the Government ; that the land whichremained to them was marked as a prey by himgry adventurers,by the refuse of the population of England and Scotland, by men—120POPE ADRIAN IV.,A national association was formed, and theassembly.members bound themselves by oath to maintain the freeand public exercise of Catholic worship, and to claim forthe people of Ireland the same privileges as were enjoyedby the people of England.All the Irish, with the excep-tion of persons who lived in fortified places occupied byconsented to draw the swordthe English garrisons,against the common enemy of their rights and of theirreligion, and resolved never to lay down arms until theyhad obtained a recognition of the independence of the IrishParliament, a removal of every degrading disqualificationmade on account of religion, and an exclusion of strangersfrom all civil and military charges in the kingdom.The King signed a proclamation on the ist of January,1642, declaring that the insurgents were traitors, andagain prohibited the exercise of Catholic worship.Parliament borrowed a large sum of money on a pledgeof the lands of the insurgents, which were regarded asalready confiscated in consequence of the rebellion.Forthis design, two million five hundred thousand acres wereThese measures served to cement the union ofset apart.the insurgents and to increase their efforts.A council of Catholic prelates and theologians was con-vened at Kilkenny, on the loth of May, 1642.
