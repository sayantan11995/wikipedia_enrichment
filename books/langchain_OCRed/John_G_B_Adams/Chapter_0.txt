AdamePREFACE.For thirty-four years I have waited patiently for someone to write a history of the 19th Kegiment MassachusettsVolunteers, but fearing that it may never be accomplished,I have concluded to send out this story.I do not dignifyit by calling it a history.It is simply a soldier's story,told by one of the "boys."Most of it is written frommemory.The account of prison lifeis taken from animperfect diary, kept by the writer while a prisoner ofwar.I sincerely hope the publication of this volume willinspire other comrades, and that from the memories thusevoked some one may gather further material whereby thedeeds of the men who so bravely followed the flags ofthe State and Nation for four long, weary years may bepreserved.JOHN G. B. ADAMS.Nineteenth Massachusetts Regiment.
