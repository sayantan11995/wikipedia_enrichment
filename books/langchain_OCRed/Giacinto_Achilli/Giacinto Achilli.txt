Asit is, they obliged the Cai'dinals (I suppose, by intimations of thepossibility of exposure) to enter into an official agreement toopen the prison doors.

Themembers of the Alliance will, I trust, never forget how much isdue to those friends, whose journey across Europe was the meansof procuring that information which led to Dr. Achilli's deUver-ance.In closing these prefatory remarks, I cannot but express myconfidence that Dr. Achilli's imprisonmeDt will open the eyesof thousands to the unchanged and unchangeable intolerance oithe Court of Rome.

OP DR. ACHILLI.an early period of his connexion with Malta, healso visited England ; where he was instrumental incollecting funds towards the establishment of theMalta Protestant College.In various parts of thiscountry which he visited for that purpose, he formedfriendships which have continued to this time.In the summer of 1848, he came again to Eng-land, to be present at the Annual Conference of theEvangelical Alliance, of which body he became amember.His mind was almost made up to visitthe United States, in order to present, in person, toa body of American Christians, a new Italian trans-lation of the New Testament, which he had recentlymade at their request ; but the events in his nativeland altered his determination.The prostration of religious tyranny in theRoman States towards the end of 1848, seemedto him a call in Providence to return there. Onthe 29th December, 1848, the great bell of theCapitol was tolled for the extinction of the temporalpower of the Popes.In the second week of January,1849, Dr. Achilli left England for Italy, and in thefirst week of February he reached Rome.As I have already said, I shall not attempt ageneral description of the state in which he foundThe events of the Roman Repul)Hchis country.of 1849 will form one of the most interesting cliii])-INQLANI>~R0MB-HI8 MAURI AQB.11tors of Modem History ; but tiiey cannot be madeI will merelyan episode to a personal narrative.record my belief, tliat justice has not been done to themen who ruled Rome during that difficult period,and that the condition of the city, especially in regardto the infrequency of crime, presents a favourablecontrast with the times of ecclesiastical dominion.It will be interesting, however, to the friends ofDr. Achilli to know something of the circumstancesof his residence in Rome, from February to July,and of these, a few of his letters to his friends inEngland will give an outline.In order not to interrupt the course of the nar-rative of his evangelistic efforts contained in thesecommunications, I will mention here, that duringthis period, viz., on the 24th June, Dr. Achilli wasmarried.Knowing that, in the language of God'sword," Marriage is honourable in all," he wasunited to an English lady, educated in Italy, MissHely, the daughter of Captain James Hely, withwhose family he had been acquainted in England.The union took place in conformity with the laws ofthe then existing Republic ; and it is here men-tioned, because upon it has been founded the chargemade afterwards against him of " immorality." How-ever his marriage may be considered in the technicallanguage of priestly discipline, no jxjrson of com-—12IMPRISONMENT, &c. OP DR. ACHILLI,men sense or Christian feeling will attribute to itthat character.The certificate of the celebration ofthe ceremony will be found at page 90.I also take this opportunity of pointing out, thatthough Dr. Achilli naturally sympathised with thepolitical aspirations of his countrymen, and availedhimself of their hostility to tyranny to excite theirattention to the corruptions of the Romish Church,yet he rigidly refrained from any participation insecular politics.It would be well if the RomanCatholic priests in Ireland could say as much ! Thereader, in perusing these letters, will make allow-ances for the position of a Christian man in theso-called " States of the Church."It is impossiblefor such a person not to rejoice in the overthrow ofthe most hateful Government in Christendom.The reader must also make allowances for ourfriend's sanguine expectations of immediate religiouschanges.These have not yet been fully realised.Perhaps, however, such changes are nearer than anyparty believes.The Word of God is not bound !The following are the letters referred to :DR.

What a pitythat here there are no persons zealous for religious things !A little work that I sent to Mr. Tonna, " Answer to theAllocution of Pius IX. at Gaeta," has produced a very greatejffect in point of religion.

My leavingwould not grieve me so much now, because I should leavemany followers of Christ and lovers of His Gospel, andnone can destroy that which the Lord has there built up.War is declared against the enemy by brave combatants,who have the strength of God : the more the attacks towhich the enemy is exposed, the more ground will helose ; and if, afterwards, we are once more free, we havealready planned to open a public church for Italian wor-ship. The late Government was inclined to give us one,when the Catholic persecution should have ceased. Now,all are persuaded that there are no better means of puttingan end to this persecution than that of showing ourselvesunanimously simple Christians, and no longer Catholicsin the Romish sense; and, since " the Bishop" has broughtwar upon us, the Romans wish to try how they could geton without a Bishop.

TA TFH! FRKNCH OOVKTINKBNT.45are made to rest, and from their very form precludethe possibility of that searching investigation whichtruth and justice demand ;—the witnesses being con-cealed, the examinations private, and the advantageoflegal advice—nay, the very privilege of self-defence,in any form, being withheld from the accused person.Your Memorialists cannot pretend to have known Dr.Achilli in all the various positions which he occupiedprevious to his conversion to the Protestant faith,nor can they affirm his blamelessness anterior to thatchange ; but they are fully capable of appreciating anydiscrepancy between the charges brought against himand the known public facts of his history, accreditedaa they are to them by sufficient testimony.Your Memorialists, therefore, direct attention to the fact,that Dr. Achilli was a Priest and a Dean of the Collegeof the Minerva at Rome, and a Dominican Friar, inthe year 1823, and, therefore, if it be true that, pre-viously to taking orders, he was attached to a younglady who retired to a Convent at Viterbo ; and if itbe true that he followed her to that place in order tobecome a Dominican ; it is at all events a truth of atleast twenty-six years' standing, and of which theauthorities took no notice until he became a Protestant.Your Memorialists are also aware, on the most satisfactoryevidence, that subsequently to this date Dr. Achilliheld several very important offices in the Order of theDominicans ; that he held high offices at Viterbo andNaples ; that he was appointed Regent of the MinervaCollege, and Vicar and Master of the Sacred Palaceand (to which your Memorialists would call particularattention) Visitor of the Convents of Romagna andLombardy, by which appointment it was committedto him to visit, regolate, and adjudicate in all theConvents from Rome to Florence,—an office whichwould not have been committed to a suspected man.—46IMPRISONMENT, dkc. OF DR. ACHILLI.Your Memorialists beg also to state, that while Prior of aDominican Convent at Naples, he became suspectedof holding doctrinal views esteemed heterodox by theChurch of Rome, and that, in consequence, as a test oforthodoxy, he was required to preach a sermonpanegyrical of the Virgin Mary, and in which hewould have been obliged to make statements whichhe conscientiously disbelieved ; that he declined to doso, and was actually seized by the Inquisition on thisexpress ground, and brought to Rome, and that, havingeflfected his escape and reached Corfu, he immediatelywrote, published, and widely circulated a letter to thelate Pope, declarative of his Protestant sentiments.*[After urging the case at some length on the FrenchGovernment, the document concludes thus :]Your Memorialists trust that they will receive from theFrench Government such a reply to this prayer aswill set at rest the minds of Dr. Achilli's numerousfriends—Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Americanswho deeply deplore his present melancholy and dan-gerous position.They desire to repeat the assurances of their profoundrespect and high consideration.(Signed)On behalf of the officers and committee,EDWARD CRAIG,LEWIS H.

A resolution had l)cen prepared, during theearly part of the sittings, expressive of the sympathyof British Christians with Dr. Achilli ; of indigna-tion at the conduct of the Inquisition in bringingaccusations against a prisoner, without allowing himto communicate with his friends, or to be heard in hisdefence ; and of the confidence felt, that the FrenchQovemment would see that justice should be done.It is due to one person to say, that the adoptionof a bolder course was suggested by a memberof the Conference, who expressed privately to severalfriends, his conviction that the resolutions pro-posed were a very insufficient fulfilment of the dutywhich the Alliance owed to one of its sufferingmembers.His opinion was communicated, duringtwo days, from one person to another, and apj)earedto be unanimously approved.As the result, thefollowing resolutions were adopted, on Thursday,the 11th October, in the Conference:" That the Conference have heard, with sincere satisfao*tion and approval, of the prompt measures which wereadopted in relation to the apprehension and imprisonmentof the Rev.

That it is eminently desirable, in the estimation ofthe Conference, that a deputation should be appointedto proceed as soon as possible to Paris, to communicate withthe French Government, and, if necessary, to Rome, onthe subject of Dr. Achilli's liberation ; and that the Councilbe instructed to take the necessary steps to send one, andto procure the funds necessary by a special subscriptionfor the purpose."Subsequently, a committee was appointed tonominate the members of the deputation, and ontheir report it was resolved :—" That the following brethren, members of the BritishOrganisation, be invited to proceed on this importantmission ; and that they be requested toavail them-selves of the services of such foreign brethren, connectedwith foreign Organisations, as they may find expedient,viz. :—Sir C.

His lordship expressed his opinionthat the Government would not commit themselveson the two last questions, which might be con-sidered as contingent; but that, on the two first, it wasnot probable, as it would not be reasonable, that anyobjection should be made.In effect, on Friday,the 26th, M. de Tocqueville informed Lord Nor-manby that he should send orders that night toRome to the French authorities, to press on theRoman Government that Dr. Achilli should not beremoved back to the Inquisition from the Castle ofTwo or three days later, GeneralRulhieres, Minister of War, infonned the Depu-St, Angelo.tation that he liad sent positive orders to themilitary commander in Rome, (not to press thedetention, but) to prevent the removal.On the same day. Lord Normanby, in giving theDeputation the above information, conveyed to themthe opinion of the French Government, that they—66IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR. ACHILLI.would do better to refrain from proceeding to Rome.It was felt possible, that such a step on the part ofemissariesof a ProtestantSociety might giveumbrage to the Pontifical authorities, and impedethe object in view.The Deputation took time toconsider ; and the same evening expressed to LordNormanby their readiness to defer, at all eventsfor the present, to the advice of the Government.This conclusion they communicated the next day,Saturday (27th), to the Foreign Minister.Theirletter and M. de Tocqueville's reply are subjoined :SIR CULLING EARDLEY TO M.

By the same courier, I have enjoined anew uponour agents to collect, and to transmit, all the positiveinformation which could put us in a situation to judge,whether Dr. Achilli is prosecuted for an ordinary crime.I have told you that, for the present, your journey toRome does not appear to me necessary. But I see no greatinconvenience in your undertaking it (you, or some ofthose who called on me with you), if it appears of any use toyou.I persist in thinking that this business, treated with-out iclat between the Pontifical Government and ourselves,has greater chance of a successful issue, than if anythinghappened to excite public opinion on the subject.But,I repeat it, this is a way of looking at it in which youmay not participate.Let me add, that if you determineon going to Rome, I am ready to give you letters ofintroduction to the General in Chief, and to the MinisterI will send you thesePlenipotentiary of the Republic.letters as soon as you will let me know your determi-nation.Receive, Sir, the assurance of my high consideration.(Signed)ALEX.

On theother hand, they might, by going, involve theircausein seriouscomplications, and exposetoinconvenience a Government which had manifesteda kind feeling towards their object.After consultation, and seeking Divine direction,they arrived at the conclusion to adopt a middlecourse. Two days previously, Mr. Lewis Tonna,of Whitehall-yard, an attached personal friend ofDr. Achilli, had been written to, requesting himto come overtoParisimmediately.Beingthoroughly familiar with the Italian language, ithad occurred to the Deputation that it would bevery desirable to induce him to accompany to Romethose members of the Deputation who might goIt was now, however, determined, that insteadthere.of any of those persons going to Rome who hadbeen publicly appointed at Glasgow by a Pro-testant Society, others should be substituted, whoseinterest in Dr. Achilli as his personal friends would70IMPRISONMENT, &c.

He said that he could not atpresent trouble the new Ministers about the letters ofrecommendation ; but that he would introduce theDeputation to M.deViel Castel, Under Secretary ofState for the Foreign Department, who might beasked for the letters.Tlie same evening, at a large meeting of Frenchand English brethren at the Hotel Bristol, it wasdetermined that MM. Tonna and Meyrueis shouldleave Paris for Rome at once ; and that as theywished to go round by Geneva, for purposes con-nected with their mission, and thence back to Lyons,the expected official introductions should follow themthere.Tlie brethren commended them in prayer,together with their imprisoned friend, to the Divineguardianship ; and the next day, November 2, theystarted for Geneva, Lyons, and Rome.Dr. Steanereturned to England; Mr. Cowan being written to, atLyons, to return speedily to Paris, and fill his place.Saturday, November 3, Mr. Noel and myselfwaited on M. de Viel Castel, at the Foreign Office,accompanied by- the Hon.

DE CORCELLES, MINISTER OF FRANCE AT ROME.Sir,This letter will be conveyed to you by Mr. Tonna, anEnglish subject, and by M. Meyrueis, of Paris, friends ofDr. Acbilli, who visit Rome with the intention of actingin his favour.They perfectly comprehend, as I believe, the necessityof using extreme caution, for the sake even of the objectAvhich they have in view ; and I doubt not that they willreceive with great deference the advice which you maygive them to that eflfect.If you do not see great inconvenience, and if there arenot insurmountable difficulties, they would desire to beenabled to converse with Dr. Achilli, and to know theI beg you to beaccusations which are laid against him.good enough to render them all the good offices whichmay be in your power.Receive the assurance of my high consideration.(Signed)D'HAUTPOUL.Tlie Deputation were strongly advised by M.Vienot, an old officer, and an ardent friend of theirobject, to call on General Oudinot, to whom heTo their objectionundertook to introduce them.that Dr. Achilli, if arrested atall by Frenchauthority, was arrested with the General's cogni-sance, it was replied, that his character was littleAID TROM 5SW MINISTBT AND FROM QENBRAL OUDINOT. 73^understood by the public ; that, with all his Con-stTvative di9|K)sitions, he was a man incapable ofreligious oppression ; and that his soldierlike frank-ness was such, that he would at once tell theDeputation whether he was friendly to their object,On MondayNoel, M.

OF DR. ACHILLI.who was present during the interview, to preparethem immediately for his signature. The Deputation,at the end of their visit, were quite inclined to con-cur in the correctness of the view expressed by M.Vienot of General Oudinot's dispositions.The same morning, Mr. Noel saw Lord Nor-manby, who had just seen the Prime Minister,General d'Hautpoul, from whom he said that he" had received such satisfactory assurances of theintentions of the Government, that he (Lord N.)believedthe Deputation might safely leave thematter to be settled between himself and the FrenchMinisters."This circumstance made us feel veryuncertain as to what might be the path of dutywith reference to allowing our brethren to proceedto Rome.It was, however, determined to write tothem at Lyons, in order to delay their progress fora short time. A letter, of which the following is anextract, was written to the British Ambassador, andis inserted here as illustrating the uniform wish ofthe Deputation to be guided by Lord Normanby'skind advice in the whole affair.SIR CULLING EARDLEY TO LORD NORMANBY.My dear Lord,Hotel Beistol, November 6, 1849.Mr. Noel has mentioned to me your advice, and thegrounde on which it is founded. We write by to-night's—MB88Ba 10NNA AND KBTRUBI8 DBLATBD ON THB BOAO. 75post to our friends who are going to Lyons, begging themto delay their departure for Rome till the arrival of thenext post.I have just received a letter of introduction fromGeneral d'Hautpool, of which I enclose a copy ; andGeneral Oudinot promised us others, this morning, to theFrench flmbassy in Rome.It is essential to us to clearAchilli's character, by local inquiries; but our friends,if they went to Rome, might totally abstain for a fewdays from any communication with the French authoritieswhich perhaps, afler all, the kindness of the FrenchGovernment may render necessary.Believe me, my Lord, with sincere obligation for yourcordial help.Your faithful and obedient servant,C. E. EARDLEY.To H. E. the Marquis of Normanby.Lord Normanby was satisfied, on seeing theterms of General d'Hautpoul's introduction, thatMM. Tonna and Meynieis might safely proceedto Rome, and advice was accordingly sent to themto do so, which overtook them at Marseilles.The following are the most important portionsof the letter in which that opinion was communi-cated:My drab Sir,Paris, Hotel Bmtol, Kot. 9, 1840.We think at last that you had better at once proceedto Rome.If we knew that positive orders were gone to Rome forour friend's liberation, or that conditional orders had beensent to liberate him in the event of certain contingencies76IMPRISONMENT, &c. OP DR. ACHILLI.which we knew to be facts, we should feel it right to askyou to relinquish the journey which, at the request of theDeputation, you have suspended for two or three days. Itcannot be denied that there is a bare possibility of the objectof your journey being known to the Pontifical authorities,and of their jealousy being thus excited, and the kindintentions of the French Government thwarted.Small asis that risk, we would not recommend you to incur itneedlessly.But as we are not in a situation to know that theorders sent are conclusive, we do not think it would beright further to interfere to prevent your continuing yourjourney.The instructions sent by the French Government toEome, may prove to have left an amount of discretionto the Ambassador and General, which your presencethere, and your statement of the merits of the case, maydecide those authorities to make use of in Achilli's favour.There is also another view of the case.though highly improbable, that the prospect of our friend'sdeliverance may be less good than we anticipate. ObstaclesThe Pope mayDelays may intervene.may be raised.Andreturn.Dr. Achilli may be left in the hands of the Inquisition.In that case it will be of great importance to be inpossession of aU the facts, in order that they may beused in his defence, and that, as a last resource, we maybring them to bear on European public opinion.The French forces may be withdrawn.It is possible,Notwithstanding the above reasons for your going,we should have hesitated about the expediency of yourjourney, if the French Government or Lord Normanbyhad strongly pressed its relinquishment.But you will see, by the enclosed letter of introductionin favour of yourself and M. Meyrueis from Generald'Hautpoul to M. de Corcelles, that every facility will begiven you at the French Embassy, and that no objectionLBTTBR TO MR. TON'NA—TO PR0CRm>-00UN8BLS.77is felt to your journey provided you use the utmost cir-cumspection.Lord Normanby, also, in a letter dated the 7th, says,that he " sees no objection to those gentlemen undertakingthe journey to Rome, provided they conform to the requestof General d'Hautpoul, that they should be cautious thattheir proceedings, when there, should not be calculated tocreate greater difficulties than at present appear to exist;"and he confirmed this opinion when we saw him yesterday.Our advice to you, therefore, is, to go as rapidly as youcan to Rome, and to present at the French Embassy theenclosed letter from General d'Hautpoul, Minister of War,and acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, to M. de Corcelle;and the other two letters, which General Oudinot has beengood enough to give, for you and M. Meyrueis, toM. de la Tour d'Auvergne, Secretary of Embassy, andColonel Eepivant, Attached to the Embassy.We think you will be wise to put yourselves verymuch into the hands of the Ambassador, to act under hisadvice, and especially to abstain as much as possible fromall needless conversation or proceedings which might makethe object of your journey notorious in Rome.If two,three, or four persons necessarily know the fact, theyIt may not beshould be engaged not to mention it.useless to suggest to the gentlemen of the Embassy them-selves, that while you take this course, it is very advisablethat, by them also, your object in Rome should not be madethe subject of conversation.spedfie aoeosations against Dr. Achilli.We advise your asking liberty at once to see theYou will judgebeet about requesting permission to visit himself at once.If you can do so without attracting much attention, itseems to us that it may be as well, for in the case of thePontifical jealousy being aroused, and of your beingsuddenly sent out of Rome, you would regret not havingreceived explanations from his own lips.—78IMPRISONMENT, &c. OP DR. ACHILLI.We will now add a few observations on the object ofyour journey.The French Government have just learned, for the firsttime, that Dr. Achilli's arrest was effected without anysanction by the French police in Rome.It seems, therefore, important to ascertain1st, The exact hour, as well as day, of his arrest.2nd, The exact hour and day of General Oudinot'stransfer of the Executive Government to the Cardinals,up to which time the French police were, as we believe,the only legal police of the city.3rd, The names of the persons who arrested him, andwhether they are known agents of the Vicar of Rome.4th, The exact words they used ;that is to say,whether it can be proved that they arrested him in thename of the French Prefect of Police ; whether theyaddressed him by his own, or by what name, and whetherthey refused to produce a warrant.5th, What offence was imputed to him at first, andwhether, since the interference of the French Govern-ment from Paris, it has been attempted to change theground of complaint, and substitute other accusations.It will be useful to know all other particulars of hisimprisonment, such as the officials before whom he hasbeen successively taken, and the time and reason of histransfer from one place of confinement to another ; wasthe transfer exclusively from the interference of friends,or in part at the instance of the Inquisition.»»Next to Dr. Achilli's deliverance, we feel very anxiousthat his character should be cleared. We have scarcelyalluded to the accusation of seduction and murder twentyyears ago, now made against him, so absurd and contra-dictory do the facts which he quotes, and which we hopemay be verified, lead us to deem it. We trust you will suc-ceed in satisfying his friends that the whole is a mere pretext.LBITBR TO MR. TONWA—AVOID PROPAGANDISM.79Wo Strongly advise your abstaining from anythingthat might be interpreted as a Protestant Propaganda inRome.It is important that the Papal authorities shouldhave no such plea against you.It will be well to say, on all occasions, that you arecome as an attached personal friend of Dr. Achilli, andthat M. Meyrueis has accompanied you from his know-ledge of Italy, and his acquaintance with Dr. Achilli andhis friends ; and that, though the Deputation of the Evan-gelical Alliance, appointed at Glasgow, has thankfullypromoted your journey, you are not, properly speaking,part of that Deputation. We have abstained from goingto Rome on purpose to avoid any complaint that thePapal Government might make against such a mission ofWe, therefore, leave the sub-a Protestant Society.ject in your hands. And I now put this upon record, tobe referred to, if needful, hereafter.Believe me, my dear sir,Faithfully yours,C. E. EARDLEY.L. H. J. ToNNA, Esq., Marseilles.P.S.—Information which has reached us leads us tobelieve that the greatest importance attaches to your beingable to prove, by documents, that Dr. Achilli has receivedecclesiastical honours, especially within the Roman States,since the time of his imputed crime.It is asserted that itis not so, and that they took the first opportunity of hisreturn to the Roman States to arrest him.I am sure I need not press on you the importance ofso acting in the matter, that if the accusation of his enemiesshould be verified (which I will not anticipate), nothingshould have been done which might be regretted, or whichwould compromise the cause of the common faith.The papers this morning announce tbat GeneralBaragucy d'llillicrs is prone to Rome, not only as General,soIMPRISONMENT, &c.

On myapplication, M. de Viel Castel then promised to sendus,through a mutual friend (Mr. Rumpff, theminister of the German Free Towns), particulars ofthe criminal accusations which had been transmittedto the Foreign Office against Dr. Achilli. In answerto M. de Viel Castel's inquiry whether it waswished to have extracts from the despatches textu-ellement (verbatim), it was replied that an abstractwould be quite sufficient.*I received in December the promised communication ; but itcontained no reference whatever to the original accusations agninstIt consisted of a double plea : first, that the French force,Achilli.military and civil, had no share whatever in the arrest ; and, secondly,that the Vicar General had a right to order the arrest of Dr. Achilli nshe did.

OF DR. ACHILLI.On the 21st November, they waited on Mr.Freeborn, H. B. M. Consular Agent, who gave arapid sketch of all the facts relating to Dr. Achilli.Most of these were either already known to them,or will be found embodied, with other informationobtained in Rome, in Mr. Tonna's report on hisreturn to London, dated December 17.Mr. Freeborn also told them that he saw himduring the Republic, while the siege of Rome waspending, and that he advised him to make his escapewhenever the city should be taken ; but that Achillireplied he had a mission to accomplish, and that hehad done nothing to oblige him to escape.Achillihad a perfect confidence in the character of theFrench rule, as a guarantee for his personal liberty.Mr. Freeborn saw him on Sunday last, and foundhim perfectly well in body and mind. He was muchastonished at his firmness of mind, not shaken duringa captivity of four months ; whereas many others,acquaintances of his own, were utterly cast downafter a confinement of a few weeks. He said, thateven had other proofs of his innocence been wanting,it was sufficient for his own satisfaction to recallwhat had occurred at their interview."But Dr.Achilli," he said, " you are guilty of a great crime,you poisoned a nun."Achilli heard and answeredhim with such perfect serenity of countenance, asMR. rRUBORN-lf.

Mr.Freebornhad, besides,procured positive proofsof Achilli's innocence, obtained by two persons, onea Roman barrister attached to the Consulate, theparticulars of which will be detailed hereafter.Tlie same day, MM. Tonnaand Meyrueis waitedon M. de Corcelles, tlie French Ambassador.

He saidthat they must be aware that it was a very delicateaffair.France' was fully prepared to use her goodoffices witii the Holy Father ; but her responsibilitywas in no way engaged, and he thought tlie bestr284IMPIIISONMEXT, &c.

But," he added, *' you understandthat France is not responsible.

OF DR.

You would not, gentlemen, take thepart of a man who was living with a person whowas not his wife."They replied that they were!DTPrr«»pmN with thb diplomatists.87not yet in a situation to furnish any proofs of Dr.Achilli being legally marrie<i, but that this wasexactly one of the points which they were come toinvestigate ; that they were deeply impressed withthe importance of ascertaining Dr. Achilli's perfectmorality, thougli they had no doubt on the subject.Our friends then requested, that, in accordancewith the directions of General d'Hautpoul, theymight, if possible, be permitted to speak with theprisoner, and also to see the accusatory documentswhich must exist.To the former request, theGeneral promised to obtain an answer.To thelatter, M. de Corcelles replied that " there were nodocuments to consult" ("aMcwn dossier ^ con-suiter**).It is impossible to refrain from comment-The French diplomatists ining on this avowal.Rome had forwarded to Paris, and, upon demandsfor explanation, had repeated more than once, accu-sations imperilling the life of a prisoner of theInquisition.It now appears that these statementswere transmitted without those who transmitted themhaving ever received any written statement whateverfrom the accusersOn Thursday, November 22, M.

Begre understood that he manifested the greatestjoy and zeal for the Gospel in his prison, where hissimple and eloquent speech and energetic characterhad exercised a great influence.Dr. Achilli, duringthe Republic, used to enter quietly into conversa-tion with those who sate near him at the cafes;and often those to whom he had spoken returnedhome with him, and remained till a late hour convers-ing. He did not meddle with politics ; official employ-ment was offered him, and he might easily have hada seat in the Assembly ; but he refused all, alwayssaying that he had another mission to accomplish.On the subject of his marriage, M. Begre saidthat he had seen the contract, and that Dr. Achillihad evidently endeavoured to clothe his union withthe most serious character, and to give it all possiblelegality.M. Begre had received his bride at hishouse; and when, from motives of prudence, shewent to Florence after the arrest, Madame Begrehad introduced her to her relations there.The same day, our friends had the opportunityof learning, that, just before the overthrow of theRepublic, several thousand persons in the city ofPBTITIO.N OP nOMANS TO LORD PALMBRSTON.89Rome were ou tlie poiut of signing a petition toLord Palmereton, for English protection to evan-gelical worship.The same afternoon, they learnt from Mr. Hely,and other members of Signora Achilli's family,particulars concerning the arrest, wliich will befound detailed in M. Tonna's report of December 17.They found that he was now well treated, and ascer-tained the names of the Physician, and of theCaptain, of tlie Fortress.They then called on Mr. Freeborn, who hadseen General Baraguey d'Hilliers, and had beenfavourably impressed by him.The General hadexpressed to him liis fears that " ces Messieurs etaienttrop arderiSy^ and Mr. Freeborn again, at liis desire,cautioned them to be calm, discreet, &c.Mr. Freeborn handed over the report made bySignor, after the investigation which he had,at the instance of the Deputation to Paris, institutedatViterbo.Signorwas also introduced,and gave an emphatical assurance that the accusa-tion about the nun was an utter and entire fabrica-tion. The substance of that document will be foundhereafter embodied in Mr. Tonna's rejwrt. Two dayslater, Mr. Freeborn, in tlie presence of our friends,unsealed and opened Dr. Achilli's papers, which hadbeen placed in his custody after the arrest.They—;90IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR.

On the 24th November,they were told that these were Chasseurs de Vin-cennes, whose head-quarters are at the FrenchPrefecture of Police ! One person, who had wit-nessed the arrest, was employed to go round totheir quarters, and to endeavour to find the corporalor men who were employed.On Sunday, November 25, they twice visitedthe Castle of St. Angelo, with a letter from theGeneral, authorising them to transmit money to Dr.Achilli, through the Captain Commandant.TheCaptain was not yet arrived in his quarters on eitheroccasion ; and this being so, they availed them-selves of tlie opportunity, being once inside, toexamine every part of it to which they could findaccess.

OP DR.

We could notbut feel that bribery was the real name of the act we hadin contemplation ; but still, the case was so grave, that wecould not lay aside this almost certain chance of savingour brother, without scrutinising to the very bottom itsreal character. We came to the conviction, between Godand ourselves, that the proposed means would be sinful,because it would involve the violation, for the love ofmoney, of a man's conscience; and we then dismissed,once for all, from our minds, an idea which so many con-tending feelings seemed at first to justify in our eyes.The object to be gained was the safety of our friend, soBut he must only be rescuediniquitously imprisoned.by means worthy of that Gospel for which he suffersThis truth is clearer than ever to our eyes after thestruggle ; and, moreover, we are persuaded that he wouldhimself refuse to escape from his lot, however cruel itmight be, by means which could not be openly avowed.We place ourselves, therefore, and liim, in our Father'shands ; at the same time, should we see other means ofeffecting his escape, we shall gladly avail ourselves of them.Every Christian conscience will respond to thesentiments of this passageWednesday, Nov. 28,—Mr. Tonna waited onMr. Petre, 98, Via de Carrozze.This gentlemanoccupies a curious office or post, created by theBritish Government ;nominally attached to theBritish Embassy atFlorence, but virtually theembodiment of our diplomacy at the Court ofPOSSIBIUTT or leOAPR-BRITISn DIPLOMACY IN ROMB. 99Rome, with a salary of about £400 a-year. Onthe death of Mr. Aubyn, the last occupant, LordAberdeen (at that time Minister of Foreign Affairs)is said to have received a multitude of applicationsfrom artists at Rome and country gentlemen inEngland, and persons of every grade and char-acter.While in considerable anxiety to make thebest selection, Mr. Petre was named to him, andwas immediately appointed,—a Roman Catholicgentleman, who had been educated at the JesuitCollege at Stoncyhurst, in Lancasliire, and had longresidedin Rome.of such anappointment may be taken as illustrative of the wayThe operationin which an open and avowed English Embassy atRome would work.The principle on which Mr.Petre ?ras selected would no doubt be tlie principleon which an ambassador would be selected—concilia-tion to the Pope. We shall see how far, in the presentcase, that thoroughgoing love of liberty, which, thankGod ! characterises England, has or has not beenrepresented at Rome.Mr. Tonna gave Mr. Petre the history of thewhole afiair of Dr. Achilli, including a sketch ofhis history, and then proceeded to ask the exerciseof Mr. Petn'*.H good offices with the Roman author-ilifs. He pointed out the impolicy of any vindic-tive proceedings against a man so generally known,o2;;100IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR. ACHELLI.and whose case was taken up by thousands ; thatwhen Protestant writers and speakers accused theChurch of Rome of holding persecuting tenets, theywere always met by the assertion that religious perse-cution had been the sin of imperfect civilisation andenlightenment, and that nothing of the sort was,or could be,practised now.If Dr. Achilli losthis liberty, and perhaps his life, for conscience' sake,what would the world say ?Tlie conversation which followed I feel myselfjustified in publishing, a diplomatist being a publicservant, and responsible to the public for the per-formance of his duties. He was waited upon offi-cially, and official conversations are not confidential,unless it be so agreed at the time.I have sub-mitted the proofs of those pages to Mr. Tonna, andif either he or myself have involuntarily misrepre-sented Mr. Petre, I undertake to insert a fly-leaf,containing any communication which that gentle-man may think fit to send to me for that purpose.Mr. Petre replied, that for a long period, nolayman had ever been touched by the Inquisitionbut that Achilli's case was very different ; he was aRoman subject, a Roman priest, and, what renderedthe case still more complicated and grave, he was airiar.Mr. Tonna replied that that was not the caseOOMMUXICATIOKS WTTB Ml.

He replied that no such order had beenreceived.If this gentleman was ignorant, as we are boundto believe, of the order referred to, it follows thatM. de Corcelles, the French Ambassador, had notof his own Embassy toallowed theknow the instructions of their common Govern-Secretaryment.Greneral Rulhieres distinctly stated to theDeputation, when in Paris, that such orders hadbeen sent from the War Office ; and it is, moreover,a fact, that the copy of the despatch of M. deTocqueville, then Foreign Minister, containing thesame orders,is atthis moment in the Foreign—106IMPRISONMENT, &c. OP DR. ACHILLI.Office, at Paris, where it has recently been seen andexamined.The same day, Saturday, December 1, our friendsmade a communication to General Baraguey d'Hil-liers, at Portici.To explain it, it will be necessaryto state what had previously occurred.For severaldays past they had been busy in ascertaining theparticulars of the arrest, and it has been thought thata clearer view of the steps taken by them wouldbe given by relating them all together, than bystating them each day as they occurred.About a week before, the following memorandumwas put into their hands, written by a person wholodged in the Palazzetto Borghese :Near midnight of the 29th July, Signer GiacintoAchilli was arrested, and carried off by six Chasseursd'Orleans, and a Corporal. M. de Sant, an officer of the4th Company of the 25th Eegiment, and Grondon, Adju-tant of the same regiment, were witnesses of this event,which took place in the Palazzo della Famiglia Borghese.These gentlemen will be able to give the name of theCorporal, as they conversed with him while the sbirri wentup to Achilli's apartments.M. Meyrueis immediately set out, late at night, insearch of these officers, and found in the PiazzaBorghese some soldiers of the 25th Regiment ; bywhom he was told that the correct names of theseofficers must be Adjutant Gandon (not Grondon),FRRNOU (XM)P8RATI0N IN ABOEST SUOOSSTBD.and Sergeant-major Desaint (not do Sant).107M.(randon being at the theatre, M.

At the hour appointed, the Adjutant met him.He told him that a friend of his had been arrestedunder such and such circumstances, and that, havingheard he had \)een on the spot, he begged him totell him all the particulars."Your company," headded, " was quartered in the Palazzetto Borghese,and you were supping in the porter's lodge withSergeant-major Desaint."^ - "he said, "not Desaint;but Sub-stance very well.lieutLiiaiii Deschamps.1 remember the circum-It was a young man who wasarrested while in be<l witlj his wife.

Finally, M. de Corcelles informed me, inthe presence of General Baraguey dllilliers, that althoughsome "soMpfofis" had been entertained against him, ofthese he was ab$out. That these suspicions were evidentlygfoandleM, M. de Corcelles himself remarked, from theefareomatuiee of his having held responsible positions inthe Choreh after he quitted Viterbo.I trust the Corres-pi>ndeiit of the Times at Rome will be on his guard, andnot henceforth trust any " inspiration "—an expressionoften employed by him—of the nature that dictated theViterbo story.With rc^^ard to Viterbo, I may here mention, that notrace or shadow of such a story is to. be found there.Itis not even a romance founded on fact, but as pure a fictionas Orlando Furioso.

He accordinglymade preparations for departure, and arrived in Romeearly in February. You have seen all the letters he wroteduring his sojourn in Rome. The information I haveobtained in Rome itself confirms minutely all that he relatedto us. He distributed the Scriptures widely, and invitediho^Q to whom he gave them, to meet him again ur visitliini ; and his house was, consequently, so constantly filledwith inquirers, that he often found little time for his meals,i^it he never preached in public (as the Roman uiuhoritiesstated), because, acting with great prudence, he determinedto follow strictly all existing laws, and he, therefore,waited for the actual promulgation, by the ConstituentAssembly, of the decree granting full protection to allreligions opinions. He did not found schools, of whicht))oy accuse him, simply because he had not time to do so.He has not even been accused of meddling with politicsI need not, therefore, allude to the subject, further than tosay, that a seat in the Assembly and high office were opento him, but he declined it all, saying he had anotherniiad<m to aooomplish.On the 24th June, he was marrit.Ml to the daughter of au the presence of the little Church orcompany of t>6lievers, with a litnr}?ical service, and agree-ably to th« laws of the existing Roman Republic.Thoceremony was performed by a converted Roman Catholicpriest, and the atto, or eertifioate of marriage, bearingthe seal of the oongr^gataon, and signed by the contracting122IMPRISONMENT, &c.

On theevening of Sunday, the 29th of July, his little familyparty, consisting of himself, his wife, his brother-in-law,Mr. Uely, and his widowed sister-in-law, Signora Dolci,formerly Miss Hely, assembled, after the evening meal,round the bed-side of Mrs. Hely, for family worship.She had long been confined to her bed by the illness whosefatal termination, in August, was accelerated by theagitating events which I am about to relate.In thecourse of his prayer.

OUDDIOrS RBrUBAL TO ARRBOT.127sitlcrs it important that tiic friends of Dr. AchilHshould know.M. de la Tour d'Auvergne stated,that General Oudinot was ask< •!to lend his con-currence to the arrest of Dr. Achilli, and that herefused it.There cannot be a stronger proof thatFrencli participation in the apprcliension was utterlyunwarrantable.If, during the French occupation,tlie Pontifical Court has had a strong friend—mostperaons tliink too strong— it is General Oudinot.Ifhe, then, condemns the step, who can defend it?The Papal authorities took good care that neitherGenend Oudinot, nor his military successors, shouldknow that tlie soldiers had been thus unworthilyemployed. Had he known it, no one can doubtleast of all, those members of the Deputation whoconversed with him in Paris—that the same manwho refused the open use of a French force, wouldhave vindicated French honour, when that forcewas fraudulently obtained.Dec.

OF DR.

When I askedthe General if he had received our letter of the 1st, atNaples, he replied that he had. When I said to him,somewhat quickly, that our letter established with cer-tainty what he absolutely contested before his departurefor Portici, he replied to me, that he did not deny it ; butthat my presence here and my proceedings were known, andthat this was more unfavourable than useful to the cause ofour friend, hindering what he could have done himself.Isaid to him that our proceedings were entirely justified bythe falseness of the information that had been transmittedfrom hence to the Government before our arrival.

Meymeis left the city forCivita Veccliia, from whence he addressed to Gene-ral Baraguey d'Hilliers, onthe21st, a letter couchedin the strongest but most respectful language. Amore irresistible appeal to the hearts and honour ofFrenchmen, could not be made, than by the pub-lication of M. Meyrueis's letter to the General.*" General,'* says M. Meyrueis, " it is evident to me,that the occult power which used our soldiers as itssecular arm, had no other effective force but theiragency. And who placed them at its service, andthat not in tliis instance alone?

Now, it is impossible ingood faith to admit the irresponsibility of the personwho contents himself with washing his hands, eventhough he may say, * I am innocent of the blood ofthat just man.'" And does the responsibilitystop with theagents ? No, it ascends logically to the Governmentwhich had promised at the Tribune that such scenesshould never be witnessed."The writer then callsupon the General to claim from Paris liberty to put anend to this abominable iniquity." The liberationof Dr. Achilli," he adds, "will do you a greathonour, General ; and whether on the part of en-lightened Christians of all communities, and of allnations, or on the part of all men of right feeling,or on the part of all good Frenchmen, it cannot butbe hailed with acclamations of applause."In the meantime, the General had been as goodas his word ; for on Thursday, Dec. 20, while M.Meyrueis was quitting Rome, the French Govern-ment had received, in Paris, a telegraphic despatch,via Toulon, from that city. The General announcedto the Minister of Foreign Affairs, that the RomanGovernment had, at length, determined to set Dr.Achilli at liberty, conducting him to the frontiers,provided the British Government, and his friends inEngland, would engage that he should leave Italy.THl 0ABDI5AL8 AOREB TO UDERATB ACHILLI.135Thauks,too, to modem facilitiesof communication,on the morning of Saturday, December 22, while M.Meyrueis was composing his report, in much anxietyof mind, on board the St. George steamer, in theMediterranean, the gratifying intelligence abovereferredto had reached Devonshire from Paris.Lord Normanby, the British Ambassador at Paris,had, it appeared, without a moment's hesitation,written to Dr. Achilli with his own hand, informinghim of the consent of the Roman Government to hisliberation, and urging him to come to Paris themoment he should be at liberty. The French Govern-ment had expressed themselves satisfied with this stepof Lord Normanby's, as the fulfilment of the conditionrequired by the Pope from the British Government.Dr. AchilH's friends in England, in compliancewith Lord Normanby's wish, immediately wrote tohim, begging him to come immediately, vici Paris,to Ent^land.This letter was sent to the BritishEmbassy in Paris, and from thence, through SirGeorge Hamilton, our Minister at Florence, to Mr.Petre, the British Diplomatic Agent at Rome, to bedelivered to the prisoner.Within three or four days, however, by regularpoet, the news arrived in England of the strong lan-guage, already mentioned, of the Pope to GeneralBaraguey d'Hilliers, about the danger which would;;136IMPRISONMENT, &c OF DR. ACHILLI.result to religion from setting Dr. Achilli at libertytogether with the intelligence of his subsequent soli-tary confinement. The apprehension could not butforce itself on the mind, that the proposed intentionto liberate him was only a ruse to gain time, asdishonourable to those who employed it, as it wouldbe insultingtothestatesmen deceived.Thisanxiety was communicated to the Foreign Ministerin Paris ; but the reply was most decided, that theGovernment knew of no hitch in the arrangementmade between the French and Roman Governmentsthat it was not likely that any obstacles should beknown in England, when they had not been reportedto Paris by the French agents at Rome ; and thatthe Government had no reason to doubt that theprisoner was already on his way to join his Frenchand English friends.Dr. Achilli's friends could only say that theyhoped the Government might be right ; but that,from what they knew of the character of the partiesto be dealt with, they retainedtheir apprehen-sions.They would, however, respectfully awaitthe result.That result was known in Paris about January10, 1850, and was quite in accordance with theexpectations of Dr. Achilli's friends, who knew thatthe Court of Rome shrinks from no deception which!SUSPICIONS or DSCRFnON—AORBBHBNT BROKEN.137will answer its purpose. Tlie letter of Lord Normanbyto Dr. Achilli, and the concurrence of the FrenchGovemraent in the conditions of the Cardinals, hadarrived in Rome towards the end of December.General Baraguey d'Hilliers, believing that he had todeal with men as upright as himself, instead of open-ing the prison doors at once, and reporting to the Popethat he had done so, thought it more courteous, andtherefore preferable, to write first to the Pope atPortici, telling him that the conditions were accepted,and requesting Inm to authorise the immediatelilx^ration.The Pope refused to do so, saying thathe would take the subject into consideration uponhis own arrival at Rome !This circumstance was known to the FrenchGovernment, as has been stated, on or before the10th January, and thereupon very decided instruc-tions were instantlysent off to Rome, which" Lettersappear to have arrived there on the 16th.from Rome of the 17th instant," says the Corres-pondent of the TimeSj " state that on the precedingevening General Baraguey d'Hilliers suddenly leftfor Portici, on the receipt of despatches brought tohim by express from Paris.His journey wasbelieved to be connected with the return of thePope to Rome, which was an.xiously desired by theFrench Government."

And this 1 said with good reason, for none knewbetter than myself the evil dispositions of the priests, whowould far rather pardon Mazzini and Garibaldi than meand let any one rather than me escape from Rome.Con-sequently, my hope in men was almost at an end, but myconfidence in God daily augmented ; so much so, that fromThisMSASURB8 m PARIS—VI8IT0IIS ANNOUNCED IN PRISON. 139my increasing faith in the protection of Him who can doeverything independently of men, I began to reckon onmy lil>eration as an approaching event, and I rememberwriting a letter to my dear wife, in which I spoke of it ascertain.On the morning of December 24 — a day usuallyconsecrated in Rome to the congratulations and goodwishes of friends—my good gaoler came to me to say thatan order had come from the French General, to allow meto have free conmiunication with a certain Dr. Bambozziand another person with him, whenever they might comeThe good gaoler, not knowing, as I did, whoto see me.the parties were who had such ample permission, deniedin every other case, to converse with me, endeavoured topersuade me that they were really two of my friends, whohad by great exertions succeeded in obtaining what hadbeen granted to no one else. But I was not deceived. Themore so, when I knew- the next day that the Adjutant ofthe Fort, a devoted friend of the priests, had asked andobtained from the Cardinals a confirmation of the order.said to myself, Either this is an agreement and under-standing between the Cardinals and the French General,or the Cardinals have performed one of their commonmanoeuvres to engage and compromise the French authori-ties in a matter altogether in their interest.
