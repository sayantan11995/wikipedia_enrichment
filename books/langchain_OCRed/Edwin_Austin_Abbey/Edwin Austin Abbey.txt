Afew  representing  the  artist's  earlier vrorkin  Harper's  Magazine  are  printed  fromthe  original  engravings  upon  wood.  The  remainder  of  the  pictures,  including  those  in  the  text  fromsketch-books  or  letters,  are  photographically  produced  blocks.  As  both  the  wood  engravings  and  thephotographic  blocks  areprinted  typographically, a  comparison,  interesting  to  the  expert,  is  possible.The  original  drawings  were  madeuponaconsiderablylargerscalethanthatupon  which  they  werepublished,  and  thus,  owing  to  the  reduction,  much  of  their  beauty  was  lost;  their  entire  charm  canonly  be  properly  appreciated  by  those  who  are  fortunate  enough  to  see  the  originals.It  is  recognised  that  certain  of  the  illustrations  are  rather  too  large  for  these  volumes,  but  thequestion  was  whether  they  should  be  included,  notwithstanding  their  size,orbeomitted  altogether.VOL.

To  the  Royal  AcademyAbbey  sent  his ' '  Fiammetta  's  Song  ";  and  he  painted  in  this  year  thewater-colour  "An  Attention."The  contract  with  the  Harpers  for  illustrations  in  the  magazinehaving  come  to  an  end,  there  was  no  imperative  call  for  Abbey  tomake  black-and-white  drawings;  but  such  was  the  exuberant  ac-tivity of  his  mind  and  hand  that,  in  spite  of  all  his  other  work,  hefound  time  to  add  to  his  store  of  illustrations,  choosing  now  a  sub-ject from  The  Deserted  Village,  now  from  The  Good  Natured  Man,or  an  old  song,  and  putting  them  away  for  future  use.  Other  by  waysfrom  the  great  high  road  of  decoration  which  he  was  now  travellingtook  him  in  this  most  fertile  year  to  the  beginnings  of  quite  a  numberof  pictures,  and  his  sketch-books  bear  testimony  to  the  scenes  andvisions  which  pursued  one  another  ceaselessly  through  his  brain,  allof  which  he  hoped  some  day  to  finish,  humanly  impossible  as  thiswould  be !  Many  were  transferred  to  canvas  and  carried  to  certainstages  of  completion;  others  remained  in  the  sketch-books,  whereagain  and  again  they  reappear  in  different  versions.  Among  themmaybe  named  the  scenes  from  The  Vicar  of  Wakefield,for  one  ofwhich  an  arbour  was  made  and  in  due  time  became  covered  with  theevergreen  honeysuckle  planted  for  this  picture.

When  in  London  for  this  pur-pose, in  February ,  Abbey  found  time  also  to  see  all  that  was  happen-ing in  the  Bond  Street  and  other  Galleries,  one  of  his  companionsbeing  R.  A.  M.  Stevenson,  who  shortly  afterwards  went  down  toFairford  on  a  visit,  principally  to  see  Mr.  Sargent's  Boston  Librarylunette.  Among  other  visitors  to  Morgan  Hall  this  spring  were  thelate  John  Hay  and  Mrs.  Hay  and  their  daughter  Helen.270IN  SEARCH  OF  ROMANESQUEIn  due  course  "Fiammetta's  Song,"  8  feet  9  inches  by  4  feet  4inches,  was  sent  to  the  Academy,  where  its  position,  according  to  apostcard  from  Mr.  W.L.Wyllie,A.R.A.,  was"  Line ,  centre ,  Room  X ' '—a  nice  example  of  artists'  laconics — and  where  it  gained  muchdelighted  attention.Abbey  had  been  hopeful  of  finishing  the  first  half  of  his  Bostonfrieze  almost  at  once;  but  there  were  difficulties  in  the  way.  He  feltthe  need  of  architectural  studies  for  the  Castle  of  the  Grail — a  panel33  feet  long — and  finally  decided  to  go  forthwith  to  the  South  ofFrance  in  search  of  early  eleventh  century  Romanesque  buildingsfor  that  purpose.  He  had  already  set  up  a  small  wooden  model  con-taining a  forest  of  columns ,  that  he  might  observe  the  effects  of  lightupon  them ,  but  this  was  not  enough .  H  e  needed  Romanesque  orna-ment, capitals,  etc.,  to  give  it  the  flavour  of  the  early  eleventh  cen-tury.  "There  existed , '  'say  s  James  Fergusson  in  his  History  of  Archi-tecture, "a  transition  style  properly  called  the  Romanesque,  whichmay  be  described  as  that  modification  of  the  Classical  Roman  formwhich  was  introduced  between  the  reigns  of  Constantine  andJustinian,  and  was  avowedly  an  attempt  to  adapt  Classical  forms  toChristian  purposes."  From  the  fifth  to  the  eleventh  century  theRomanesque  was  but  little  removed  from  the  debased  Roman,  butthe  late,  fully  developed  Romanesque  of  the  eleventh  and  twelfthcenturies  is  in  every  sense  an  original  style  of  great  richness  anddignity.It  was  in  order  to  find  the  best  specimens  of  this  style  that  theAbbeysandMrs.  Mead  went  abroad  early  in  May.  After  a  few  daysin  Paris,  they  went  on  to  Lyons,  not  forgetting  that  this  was  thebirthplace  of  Puvis  de  Chavannes,  who  also  was  at  work  on  decora-tions for  the  Boston  Library,  and  there  (among  many  other  finethings  in  the  town)  they  saw  on  the  staircase  of  Le  Palais  des  Artshis  "  Bois  Sacre,"  and  the  two  allegorical  figures  of  the  Rhone  andthe  Saone,  all  of  which  are  among  his  noblest  works.  It  was  a  greatdisappointment  to  miss  the  wonderful  journey  down  the  Rhone  toAvignon  by  boat ,  but  being  a  fortnight  too  early  they  had  to  proceed271LE  PUY-EN-VELAYEto  Avignon  by  train.  Avignon,  however,  had  little  tooffer,the  elev-enth and  twelfth  century  buildings  having  been  so  frequently  re-stored, and  practically  rebuilt,  that  although  there  was  plenty  ofGothic  the  Romanesquehad  disappeared.  Abbey 's  harvestof  archi-tectural studies  or  sketches  was  therefore  small ,  but  he  found  others .On  one  day,  for  example,  while  driving  about  the  country  beyondthe  walls,  he  made  a  very  beautiful  study  of  a  very  young  olive  or-chard on  a  spring  hillside,  and  on  another  of  gorse  on  a  long  stretch  ofcommon,  which  he  used  for  the  pastel  of  "What  the  Shepherd  Saw. ' 'At  Aries  he  worked  in  the  Cathedral  of  St.  Trophime  and  else-where, and  driving  one  day  to  the  famous  ruin  of  the  Abbey  of  MontMajeur,  about  four  miles  from  Aries,  made  a  study  of  a  subterraneanchapel,  which  was  used  for  "The  World  Without,"  the  unfinishedpicture ,  begun  soon  after  his  return  to  Morgan  Hall ,  which  has  b  eendescribedabove.AtNimeshefoundverylittle,butatAiguesMorteshe  made  a  study  of  the  long  straight  road  into  the  portal  of  the  townwhich  reappears  in  his  picture ' '  The  Bridge,"  exhibited  at  the  RoyalAcademy  in  1 898 .  From  Nimes  an  excursion  was  made  to  Tarascon ,with  a  diversion  up  the  hills  to  the  strange  ruins  of  Les  Baux.In  the  Auvergne  the  country  had  been  rich  in  the  material  desired „and  at  LePuy-en-Velaye  the  party  settled  down.  Itislateinthedayto  describe  this  remarkable  relic  of  antiquity;  enough  to  say  that  toan  artist  of  Abbey's  sensitiveness  it  was  at  once  a  stimulus  and  a  joy.Both  in  the  cathedral  and  in  its  chapel  of  St.  Michel  d'Aiguilhe  pin-nacled high  on  its  rock  he  found  inspiration  and  treasure.But  although  the  cathedral  yielded  so  much  and  the  chapel  of  St.Michel  yielded  so  much,  each  in  its  own  way,  Le  Puy  was  to  do  stillmore.  Not  yet  had  the  particular  details  of  the  Castle  of  the  Grailfor  which  Abbey  had  left  home  disclosed  themselves;  but  on  oneof  those  golden  afternoons  the  search  was  rewarded,  and  all — as  itshould  be — by  chance.  Abbey  was  in  the  Museum.  A  door  stoodopen  into  a  lumber  room  and,  peeping  within,  he  saw  there  a  quan-tity of  architectural  remains.  Entering  and  looking  about  among  thedebris  he  found  several  Romanesque  stone  capitals,  the  very  thingsfor  his  frieze.  On  interviewing  the  Director  as  to  whether  casts  of272INTERNATIONAL  AMENITIESthese  could  be  obtained  he  was  told  that  none  existed,  but  that  pos-sibly the  Trustees  would  allow  some  to  be  made,  and  at  the  sugges-tion of  the  Director  he  went  to  the  Town  Library  to  find  the  Juge  dePaix,  who,  usually ,  it  seemed,  was  reading  there  after  lunch.  Here  ina  spacious  room ,  a  harmony  of  brown  and  red  and  blue  and  gold ,  theentire  walls  lined  with  books ,  sat  three  or  four  elderly ,  studious  gen-tlemen, one  of  whom  was  the  desired  functionary.  Nothing  couldhave  gone  better!  The  case  was  presented.  Monsieur  required  castsfor  his  decoration  of  a  library  at  Boston  in  America!  How  extremelyinteresting  for  Le  Puy ,  so  ancient ,  to  contribute  to  the  beauty  of  thatdistant  city  so  modern!  Assuredly  the  casts  might  be  made,  and  theJudge  himself  would  conduct  Mr.  and  Mrs  Abbey  to  a  moulagistein  the  town — M.Pellegrini — and  give  the  required  sanction.  And  soitwasdone.  Certain  delays  were,  it  is  true,  to  be  suffered,  and  littlemisunderstandings  had  to  be  cleared  up  before  the  casts  could  bedispatched ,  M .  le  Maire  having  a  fear  that  some  commercial  use  wasto  be  made  of  them .  But  a  letter  from  the  President  of  the  Royal  Aca-demy,  Sir  Frederic  Leighton,  written  at  Abbey 's  request  on  officialnotepaper,  made  everything  all  right,  and  the  casts  were  duly  re-ceived at  Morgan  Hall,  and  were  painted  into  the  great  Castle  of  theGrail  panel,  and,  at  this  moment,  their  active  career  at  an  end,  theyrepose  in  the  studio  at  Woodcote  Manor.Leighton ,  by  the  way ,  enj  oy  ed  the  reciprocity  of  occasionally  bor-rowing a  model  from  his  friend.  We  find,  for  example,  in  a  letterwritten  to  Abbey  in  the  following  year,  this  request:  "Will  you  bequite  disgusted  if  I  ask  you  to  lend  me  Maude  just  once  more?  Ofcourse,  if  it  inconveniences  you  very  much  you  must  send  me  to  theright-about.  "The  President's  next  letter  indicates  what  happened:"Maude  says  that  you  are  nothing  less  than  an  angel  for  letting  hercome  up — for  that  you  are  yourself  driven  for  time .  I  am  truly  con-273cerned to  hear  the  latter,  and  I  heartily  concur  in  the  former."It  was  stated  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter  that  the  fruitful  year1894,  in  addition  to  so  much  enterprise,  was  to  see  Abbey's  firstdrawings  in  pastel.  The  origin  of  his  experiments  with  this  medium,of  which  he  rapidly  became  a  master,  was  the  departure  of  Mrs.THE  FIRST  PASTELMead  for  America,  shortly  after  reaching  Morgan  Hall  again  fromthe  French  tour;  for,  in  order  to  distract  his  wife 's  thoughts  from  thisseparation,  Abbey,  immediately  on  his  return  from  the  station,  beg-ged her  to  come  into  the  studio  and  sit  to  him  for  a  purpose  that  hehad  long  had  in  mind.  This  she  did;  and,  taking  his  chalks  in  hishand ,  he  made  that  day ,  after  one  or  two  discarded  attempts ,  the  firstof  a  fascinating  series  of  pastels,  "The  Blue  Door,"-— based  uponthe  sketch  of  a  door  of  that  colour  in  a  garden  wall  seen  and  noted  atRavello  in  1891 .  This  pastel,  which  was  never  shown  in  England,but  was  sold  in  New  York  the  following  winter  at  his  first  pastel  ex-hibition there,  was  the  forerunner  of  many,  and,  indeed,  by  the  endof  the  year  Abbey,  delighting  in  the  sympathetic  alliance  of  chalk,by  whose  aid  so  much  that  is  joyous  can  be  accomplished  at  a  singlesitting,  had  completed  enough  examples  for  the  exhibition  in  ques-tion. Not,  however,  until  the  autumn  of  1895  did  he  show  any  inEngland.Thefact  that  Abbeywas  no  longer  under  any  contract  withMessrs.Harper  having  become  known,  there  was  now  not  a  little  competi-tion for  his  black-and-white  work,  and  an  unfinished  letter  to  Mr.Austin  Dobson,  in  August  of  this  year,  shows  that  he  was  not  neg-lecting this  branch  of  his  art.  "I  wonder,"  he  says,  "if  you  have  anidea  of  what  the  general  aspect  of  the '  1 2  Good  Rules ,  'with  the  printat  the  top,  was  ?  I  want  to  stick  it  up  in  the  inn,  and  although  it  willappear  when  printed  about  half  the  size  of  a  postage  stamp,  per-haps , I  'd  like  to  get  it  right .  "  In  August  the  late  R . W .  G ild er ,  editorof  the  Century  Magazine,  wrote:  ' '  Our  people  are  telegraphing  youto-day  asking  for  the  first  chance  with  your  delightful  project  of  il-lustrating The  Deserted  Village.  .  .  .  They  would  take  the  greatestpossible  pride  in  laying  out  the  work  to  suit  you.  .  .  ."Abbey,  how-ever, had  to  decline.  Immediately  afterwards  he  was  thus  appro-ached byMr.E.L.  Burlingame,the  editor  of  Scribner's:"Ihavebeengreatly  interested  by  hearing  this  summer  that  the  expiration  of  oldagreements  made  it  possible  now  for  works  of  yours  to  appear  else-where than  in  Harper's  where  we  have  all  been  accustomed  to  lookat  it  rather  enviously  these  many  years.

"—This  requestAbbey  was  glad  to  comply  with,  and  his  drawing — a  pastel — was  atonce  done ,  and  was  reproduced  in  the  following  April  number  as  ar-ranged,with  its  full  title, transcribed  by  Abbey  in  Gothic  lettering.*This  was  his  first  contribution  to  this  famous  magazine,  for  when,in  the  middle  eighteen-seventies,  as  a  free-lance,  he  had  made  cer-tain historical  illustrations  (as  described  in  Chapter  VI .)  they  werefor  Scribner 'sMonthly ;  and  Scribner' s  Monthly  and  Scribner'sMaga-zine  were  different  publications.  Scribner 's  Monthly,  after  a  careerof  many  years ,  disappeared  in  1 88 1 ,  to  be  merged,  by  a  business  ar-rangement, henceforward  in  the  Century  Magazine.  But  in  January,1 887 ,  the  firm  of  Scribners  decided  to  begin  afresh — with  what  dis-tinction and  success  is  too  well  known  to  need  any  emphasising  here .Among  the  visitors  to  Morgan  Hall  this  summer(  1 894)were  J .  M .Swan,  J.  MacWhirterJ.  W.  North,  R.W.Macbeth,  Alfred  Parsons,the  Tademas ,  the  Orchardsons ,  and  Henry  James ;  and  it  was  duringthis  visit  that  the  novelist,  who  had  become  very  dependent  upon"new  laid"  eggs,  and  who  found  great  difficulty  in  procuring  themin  London,  spoke  of  the  boon  it  would  be  to  him  to  have  at  home  a27Sconstant  supply  as  notablef or  freshness  as  thosethatwerebeing  daily"And  moreover  on  Good  Fryday  the  Queane  and  her  Ladyes  are  to  humble  them-selves crepynge  to  ye  Crosse  bearyng  also  in  their  handes  dyvers  gyftes  of  egges  andapples  and  thus  to  signifie  an  humblynge  of  oureselffes  unto  Chryste  before  ye  Crosseand  ye  Kissynge  of  it  a  memorie  of  our  Redemption  made  upon  ye  Crosse."HENRY  JAMESset  before  him.  It  was  at  once  recognised  that,  whoever  went  short,he  must  at  all  hazards  be  provided;  andaboxwas  speciallyconstruc-ted  for  the  purpose  of  moving  continually  from  the  Gloucestershirepoultry  run  to  De  Vere  Gardens  full,  and  from  De  Vere  Gardens  tothe  Gloucestershire  poultry  run,  empty.  As  Henry  James  was  themost  punctilious  of  men,  it  followed  that  his  acknowledgments  ofthe  benefits  thus  conferred  upon  him  were  of  courtesy  compact.Here  are  some  of  them:  "The  box  has  flown  back  to  you,  on  thewings  of  all  the  (remotely)  potential  chickens  of  all  the  blessed  eggs—this  veiy  day.  It  was  my  fault  that  my  good  woman  didn't  return  itsooner.Good  Woman  (ihedayitcame):  Shall  I  send  it  back  to-day,  sir?Modest  Man:  Oh,  wouldn't  that  look  rather  greedy  ?

In  course  of  time  he  re-ported that  the  Conduit  Street  Gallery ,  where  theNineteenth  Cen-tury Art  Society  exhibited,  would  do,  and  Mrs.  Abbey  hastened  toLondon  to  secure  it  for  a  period  in  January,  while  the  painting  ofKing  Arthur's  Round  Table,  which  had  been  shown  at  the  Chicago278NEW  YEAR'S  CARDWorld's  Fair  and  was  now  in  Boston,  was  cabled  for  to  complete  theset,  and  Abbey  redoubled  his  efforts  over  the  finishing  touches  tothe  remainder.Thusendedtheyear,whichsawthepublication,in//flr/)er'5Mfl^fl-zine,of  the  illustrations  to  A  Winter's  Tale,  in  April,  and  TheTamingof  the  Shrew,  in  December.

Income  from  illustrations  (black-and-white  work)  had ,  forthe  time,  practically  ceased,  and  the  Boston  work  brought  in  no  sur-plus. On  the  contrary,  it  meant  a  deficit.  How  could  it  be  otherwise?The7,ooodollars(;£i,40o)paidfor  the  first  half  of  thefrieze — 9ofeetpacked  with  life-sized  figures  based  on  careful  studies  of  each  figurein  charcoal  and  chalk  and  in  oil— had  long  since  been  anticipated  andspent.  During  the  first  four  Morgan  Hall  years  the  expenses  of  thestudio ,  where  nothing  was  spared ,  and  where  the  motto  was ' '  Smallin  the  studio,  small  work,"  had  been  enormous,  involving  as  theydid  all  the  paraphernalia  needed  for  work  on  this  scale,  scaffoldings,stretchers,books,costumes,stuffs,armour,casts,models,a  thousandand  one  objects,  to  say  nothing  of  the  time  required  for  the  masteryof  the  details  of  the  task  and  of  the  necessary  journey  ings  abroad.280THE  "HOLY  GRAIL"  EXHIBITIONAbbey  was  still  little  known  as  a  painter  in  oil.  Neither  "May-DayMorning"  nor  "Fiammetta's  Song"  had  been  sold.  Bothwerelargecanvases:  "Fiammetta's  Song,"  being  8  feet  long,  demanded  toogreat  a  wall  space  for  the  average  house,  which  made  it  less  saleablethan  a  smaller  work,  and  "May-Day  Morning,  "although  it  had  infact  been  practically  sold,  was  again  on  the  artist's  hands  owing  tothe  fact  that  it  was  6  inches  too  long  for  the  recess  in  which  it  was  tohang;  but  neither  now  nor  afterwards  did  Abbey  yield  to  pressure  topaint  pictures  of  any  size  other  than  the  subjects  seemed  to  him  todemand.  He  was  bent  upon  delivering  his  message  in  his  own  lan-guage, and  this  was  not  the  language  of  the  so-called  easel  picture.*But  the  exhibition  in  London  proved  a  wise  measure;foralthoughwhen  the  Abbeys  sailed  for  America  they  carried  with  them  the  bur-den of  a  debt  amounting  to  .£1 ,600,  in  less  than  a  year,  thanks  to  thefillip  now  given  to  the  painter's  fame,  the  debt  was  paid  in  full.  Onthe  back  of  a  small  document,  dated  1 895 ,  in  Mrs.  Abbey 's  writing,is  the  endorsement '  'Penniless  but  free , '  'and  free  in  this  respect  theyremained  ever  after,  although  great  economy  (every  where  but  in  thestudio)  had  still  to  be  practised  for  some  years  to  come.The  private  view  of  theHoly  G  rail  exhibition  was  on  January  i  9th ,1895 ,  and  to  those  who  knew  Abbey  only  as  a  draughtsman  in  black-and-white  the  work  shown  there  came  as  a  revelation.  It  also  im-mensely increased  his  reputation.  What,  however,  meant  more  toone  who  never  cared  for  publicity  was  the  appreciation  of  his  fellowartists.  From  Millais,  for  example,  came  at  once  this  cordial  note:"I  must  write  a  line  to  say  what  pleasure  your  work  has  given  me.For  years  I  have  seen  and  admired  your  beautiful  illustrations,  andcongratulate  you  on  this  larger  undertaking.

Agnew's  Exhibition  of  English  Art  (in  1901),  and  now  in  the  Municipal  Art  Gal-lery of  Preston;  "The  Bridge,"  now  in  the  gallery  at  Capetown;  and  one,  considerably  lar-E:r — "Who  is  Silvia?  What  is  she?" — now  owned  by  Senator  Clark,  of  New  York,  and  hisiploma  picture  "The  Lute  Player,"  Abbey  never  painted  anything  smaller  than  the  twopaintings  he  first  completed.28lTHE  PASTELSfifty  in  number,  the  "May-Day  Morning,"  "Fiammetta's  Song,"and  the  water-colour  "An  Attention. '  'About  ten  days  later  Abbey'sstudio  man,  Walter  Fisher,  followed  with  the  Grail  canvases.The  exhibition  inNew  York  was  on  a  different  business  basis  fromthe  exhibition  in  London,  and  there  was  not  the  same  adventure-someness  about  it.  It  was  held  in  one  of  the  galleries  used  by  theAmerican  Art  Association,  which  was  much  more  satisfactory  forthe  purpose  than  the  London  one;  while  in  a  smaller  room  were  hungthe  two  oil  paintings  and  the  pastels,  "  Fiammetta's  Song"  beingplaced  in  a  frame  specially  designed  by  Stanford  White.  "An  At-tention "  was  reserved  for  the  Spring  Exhibition  of  the  AmericanWater-Colour  Society.  In  the  meantime  a  room  in  another  part  ofthe  building  had  been  placed  at  Abbey's  disposal  for  a  studio  to  beused  as  such  as  long  as  he  remained  in  New  York,  and  here  he  putthe  finishing  touches  to  any  pastels  that  needed  them,  and  heremany  friends  daily  flocked  to  see  him.  Although  this  was  a  time  ofgreat  financial  depression  in  America  (when  art  is  the  first  to  suffer)the  public  flocked  in  such  crowds  to  the  Holy  Grail  exhibition  thatat  times  it  became  impossible  to  move  about,  and  during  the  entireperiod  the  galleries  were  always  full ,  so  that  the  managers  thought  itwell  to  keep  it  open  a  week  or  more  beyond  the  time  arranged.  Ab-bey 's  artistic  success  was  notonly  immediate  but  beyond  the  highestexpectations.  Meanwhile  Harper 's  Weekly  devoted  a  double  page  tothe  rep  reduction  of  a  Round  Table  panel,  and  a  small  volume  waspublished  by  Messrs.  R.  H .  Russell,  a  kind  of  handbook  to  the  series,forwhich  Abbey,  whileintheclutchesof  influenza, designedaposter.The  sale  of  "Fiammetta's  Song"  and  "May-Day  Morning"  stilltarried,  but  the  pastels  delighted  spectators  and  found  ready  pur-chasers, and  the  reproduction  rights  in  a  selection  of  them  werequickly  secured  by  Scribner's  Magazine,  where  they  appeared  in  theAugust  number  accompanied  by  a  pleasant,  conversational  appre-ciation of  this  new  weapon  in  his  f  riend's  armoury  by  F.HopkinsonSmith,  from  which  may  be  quoted  these  passages:"You  feel  in  them  [the  pastels]  that  when  once  he  had  clearly  con-veyed his  idea  he  stopped  short;  that  when  by  some  dexterous  use  of282F.  HOPKINSON  SMITHthe  'grit'  of  the  medium,  he  had  expressed  the  sheen  on  the  round  ofthe  mandolin  in '  The  Girl  in  Red ,'  or  caught  the  glint  of  gold  on  thedish  in '  The  Golden  Dish , '  he  threw  the  bit  of  chalk  aside,  knowingthat  no  added  touch  could  improve,  just  as  did  that  other  painter,the  late  William  Hunt ,  who  would  say  to  his  pupils ,  whenever  a  mor-sel of  grey  paper  escaped  the  wash  of  the  brush  and  by  some  luckychance  was  the  exact  tone  needed '  Leave  it .  Thank  God ,  and  pass  on ,you  can  never  better  it. ..  .'"Abbey  never  fails  to  rise  above  the  plane  of  the  mere  illustra-tor— that  of  the  man  who  illustrates  the  text  and  is  content.  He  hasalways  done  more  than  this,  he  has  worked  as  the  poets  do.  He  haschosen  themes  which  other  men  have  used,  stories  they  have  told,men  and  women  they  have  pictured .  About  these  has  played  the  fireof  his  own  fine  imagination ,  transforming  and  ennobling  them."Where  Goldsmith  leaves  off  Abbey  begins.  It  is  always  some-thing of  himself  that  he  adds,  and  it  is  always  a  refinement  of  thetheme,  never  a  touch  that  degrades."If  he  gives  us 'Portia'  it  is  not  only  the  woman  of  affairs,  the  wisecounsellor,  but  the  merry  triumph  beneath  it  all  that  shows  at  aglance  her  enjoyment  of  the  humour  of  her  escapade. "The  exhibition  in  New  York  closed  on  March  i  yth ,  and  as  soon  aspossible  the"Holy  Grail"  panels  were  removed  to  Boston,  wherethe  Abbeys  became  the  guests  of  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Charles  Fairchild  at191  Commonwealth  Avenue.  In  April  Abbey  was  busy  in  super-intending the  placing  of  his  paintings  on  the  walls  of  the  DeliveryRoom  of  the  Public  Library,  to  which  the  canvases  were  fixed  by  aprocess  called  marouflage.  The  top  of  the  canvas  was  tacked  alongthe  top  of  the  wall  space,  and  the  canvas  was  then  rolled  up  to  thetacking.  The  wall  beneath  was  covered  with  a  thick  coat  of  whitelead,  and  the  canvas  (already  painted  on  the  back  with  red  lead)  was283then  turned  back  upon  this  white  lead  and  rolled  on  to  the  wall  as  if  itwere  wall  paper,  and,  like  wall  paper,  when  dry  becoming  as  solidlyfixed  to  the  wall  as  if  it  were  the  wall  itself.  Unfortunately  there  weremany  pinholes  in  the  canvases,  where  drawing  pins  had  been  stuckto  hold  the  various  studies  required  for  the  work  while  in  progress,FIXING  THE  FRIEZEand  the  troublesome  pinholes  had,  in  some  cases ,  grown  beyond  thesize  of  an  ordinary  pin,  and  through  each  hole,  however  tiny,  oozedthe  white  lead;  and  these  spots  had  all  to  beremoved  or  touched  up,as  had  also  the  spots  made  by  the  white-leaded  hands  of  the  work-men. This  trouble,  however,  was  minimised  in  the  future  by  greatercare  in  the  studio  when  the  work  was  in  progress,  and  greater  care  onthe  part  of  the  workmen.But  there  were  other  more  important  things  that  Abbey  learnedfrom  this ,  his  first  exp  erience  in  seeing  a  decorative  work  of  his  ownon  the  wall  of  the  room  for  which  it  had  been  painted,  at  its  properheight,  the  bottom  of  the  frieze  being  1 1  feet  from  the  floor.  In  the24  feet  panel  of  Arthur's  Round  Table  were  forty  or  more  angels,each  angel  with  a  golden  halo,  and,  as  the  painter  had  feared  wouldbe  the  case,  these  halos  high  up  in  the  dark,  close  to  the  ceiling,  toldas  black.  After  consultation  with  Stanford  White,  he  decided  tobuild  them  up  in  low  relief,  and  when  this  was  done  and  they  hadbeen  regilded,  dark  as  it  was,  they  told  as  lights  and  gleamed  andglinted  in  their  true  places.  The  halo  of  the  Grail  Angel  bringingsustenance  to  the  child  Galahad,  in  the  first  panel,  was  treated  in  thesame  way,  and  with  the  same  satisfactory  result.  There  were  otherdetails  wrhich  did  not  tell  as  Abbey  had  intended ,  and  upon  which  heworked  before  the  scaffolding  was  taken  down;  but  so  much  did  helearn  on  this  occasion  that  when,  at  the  close  of  the  year  1901 ,  hebrought  the  second  half  of  the  frieze  to  the  Library  it  needed  theminimum  of  alteration.Writing  to  Alma  Tadema  from  New  York  on  May  i8th,  Abbeysays : ' '  We  had  a  great  time  in  Boston .  I  wish  you  could  see  th  e  thingsin  place — John's  looks  stunning.  You  see  it  from  a  great  distancebelow,  and  he  has  gilded  the  whole  interior  of  the  space  and  it  is  alllighted  by  strong  reflected  light;  it  gains  tremendously  and  as  a  com-position is  for  the  first  time  complete.  We  both  suffered,  as  I  havesaid,  fearfully  from  the  heat,  working  on  scaffolds  under  the  ceiling—I  in  a  room  crowded  all  day  with  people  all  breathing  hard .  I  thinkmy  affair  looks  b  etter  than  it  ever  did  b  ef ore — although  it  has  massesof  detail  which  tell  as  nothing.  I  am  pleased  that  it  looks  right  in284THE  "RICHARD"  BEGUNscale.  I  have  learned  a  great  deal  seeing  it  in  place  and  shall  do  therest  of  it  with  greater  confidence.

"After  b  eing  away  for  nearly  six  months ,  the  Abbeys  reached  homeearly  in  June,  and  it  was  not  long  before  a  new  picture,  which,  withmore  pastels  and  the  continuation  of  the  Holy  Grail  frieze,  waschiefly  to  occupy  the  rest  of  the  year,  was  begun.  A  letter  from  Abbeyto  his  brother  on  August  5th, tells  someof  the  news:  "I  have  beenworking  very  hard  ever  since  our  return .  I  am  to  have  an  exhibitionofpastelshereinOctoberorNovember — October  26th  I  believe  thedate  is — and  they  want  more  than  I  am  afraid  I  can  finish.

The  thread  of  the'  Grail '  things ,  too ,  I  am  gradually  taking  up ,  and  two  canvases ,  one1 1  feet  and  the  other  1 6  feet,  are  mapped  out.  I  am  trying  to  get  agreyhorse,  but  there  doesn't  seem  to  be  the  right  sort  of  one  in  the  neigh-bourhood— I  don't  mean  to  ride,  but  to  paint  from    "A  number  of  letters  which  Mrs.  Abbey  was  now  writing  to  hermother,  and  which  fortunately  have  been  preserved,  help  us  tomore  intimate  knowledge  of  Morgan  Hall  life  at  this  time,  and  inthe  two  or  three  years  to  follow.  They  tell  us  that  on  June  igthAbbey  and  his  wife  went  to  Paris,  where  they  met  again  Whistlerand  Mrs.  Whistler ,  arranged  with  Dujardin  to  make  copperplates  ofsome  of  the  Deserted  Village  drawings ,  in  case  the  artist  himself  de-cided to  publish  them,  and  saw  and  enthusiastically  admired  Puvisde  Chavannes'  decorations  for  the  Boston  Library.Work  was  steady  all  the  summer,but  Abbey  found  time  for  cricketpractice  and  base-ballpractice  in  the  afternoons, andhewentovertoHenley  for  the  regatta,  but  was  spared  the  humiliation  of  witness-ing Cornell's  defeat.  Meanwhile  Abbey  and  Mrs.  Abbey  were  bothVOL.  ii. — c  285J.S.SARGENTlearning  the  bicycle ,  and  one  of  their  early  excursions  was  in  Augustto  Kelmscott  to  the  Morrises.  Mrs.  Abbey  writes:  "We  had  tea  firstand  then  went  into  the  garden,  which  was  like  fairy  land.  They  areto  give  us  some  roots  in  the  autumn."In  the  same  month  we  learn  that  Abbey  was  much  occupied  withimprovements  to  the' '  Fiammetta . ' '  Also ' '  he  has  done  several  lovelynew  pastels  for  the  London  Exhibition  at  the  end  of  October."  InSeptember:  "We  went  to  see  Sargent  yesterday  afternoon,  saw  thesketches  and  Gothic  stuffs  he  brought  back  with  him  from  Spain-all  very  fine.  He  is  working  atthedesignforhis  second  ceiling,  as  yetonly  on  paper  in  charcoal,  but  he  has  decided  to  paint  it  in  London.There  are  so  many  figures  in  it,  and  he  will  need  such  a  variety  ofmodels ,  and  will  want  to  look  up  things  so  constantly  in  the  NationalGallery  and  British  Museum  that  he  thinks  it  will  hamper  him  to  bein  Fairf  ord ,  so  he  will  probably  not  be  with  us  this  year  at  all .  He  ex-pects to  do  the  lunette  in  Fairf  ord , but  that  will  not  be  for  a  long  time,for  he  will  probably  not  begin  it  until  the  ceiling  is  well  advanced.[As  a  matter  of  fact,  Mr.  Sargent  did  not  work  in  the  Morgan  Hallstudio  again.]  Ned  has  done  a  number  of  sketches — several  in  pastel—for  the '  Castle  of  the  Maidens ,  'with  which  Tadema  was  delighted .Then  too ,  he  is  working  on '  Richard  III.'  H  e  is ,  of  course ,  very  dis-appointed that  Sargent  is  not  coming  down  this  winter,  and  I  amvery ,  very  sorry.  Sargent  must  be  in  town  all  through  October  andNovember  to  teach  in  the  Academy  Schools."September  2Oth. — We  dined  with  Sargent  at  the  Indian  Exhi-bition the  last  night  we  were  in  London  and  had  a  jolly  time.  He  iscoming  down  to-morrow  for  Sunday.  We  had  had  a  perfectly  love-ly day — had  spent  the  entire  day  at  Westminster  Abbey  and  in  theManuscript  Room  of  the  British  Museum  looking  up  data  for  the'Richard  III.'  picture.  Ned  is  tremendously  interested  in  it."September  a8th. — Ned  has  been  doing  pastels  and  working  onhis '  Richard  III.'  Sargent  was  immensely  impressed  with  it — thinksit  the  very  best  picture  Ned  has  done — got  Ned  to  have  it  broughtfrom  the  studio  and  hang  it  on  the  wall  of  the  dining-room,  where  itremained  for  a  few  days.  He  thinks  he  knows  the  very  model  for  the286THE  NEW  PASTELSLady  Anne's  face,  a  girl  with  good  colour,  who  has  never  sat,  whocame  to  see  him  the  other  day.

To  the  catalogue  Mr.  Pennell  contributed  a  preface,  in  whichhe  said  that  they  were  an  evidence  not  only  of  the  artist's  "perfectcommand  of  material,  but  of  the  perfect  grace,  the  exquisite  refine-ment, which  hethrows  around  every  subject  he  touches.  Simple  asare  the  means  he  uses,  and  direct  as  is  the  treatment,  the  result  issubstantial ,  solid  and  real .  Just  a  few  touches  and  ladies ,  that  Gains-borough or  Reynolds  saw,  pass  across  lawns,  over  which  the  sha-dows chase  each  other,  or  emerge  for  a  moment  into  a  sunlit  space..  .  .  In  every  one  of  these  pictures  there  is  the  most  perfect  sense  ofmovement,  the  most  perfect  feeling  that  the  next  moment  the  treeswill  sway  or  the  clouds  will  pass,  and  what  is  shadow  will  be  sun-shine, and  where  the  light  sparkles  will  be  quiet  shadeWhat  other  painter  is  there  who  makes  one  feel  that  plays  are  real  ?When  did  Sir  Anthony  Absolute  and  Sir  Lucius  O 'Trigger  swaggerso  pompously?  And  when  upon  thestage  was  David  so  humble  orBob  Acres  so  fine?  .  .  .  There  is  no  parade  of  these  things.  Theretheyare .  And  yet  when  you  come  to  look  at  them ,  they  are  put  down  witha  touch,  but  that  is  right.  How  can  one  write  about  works  that  arealtogether  beautiful?"Artistically  this  exhibition  was  an  immense  success,  and  it  mate-rially increased  Abbey's  reputation.  But  financially  it  was  an  abso-lute failure,  and  only  three  pastels  were  sold.  The  public  was  notaccustomed  to  this  medium.  But,  just  as  in  the  past  he  did  pioneerwork  as  an  illustrator  in  black  -and  -white ,  and  "  showed  th e  way , "  sonow  Abbey  was  a  pioneer,  and  no  long  time  passed  before  pastelsbecame  the  vogue,  and  in  1 898  the  Pastel  Society  was  founded — to287AN  AMERICAN  HONOURhold  annual  exhibitions  in  the  Royal  Institute  Galleries,  Piccadilly.Of  the  Society  Abbey  became  an  honoured  member,  although  hehad  no  direct  hand  in  its  formation.London,  however,  stood  alone  in  its  reluctance  to  buy.  For  whena  few  months  later  Abbey  had  a  second  exhibition  of  pastels  in  NewYork ,  consisting  of  the  unsold  English  ones  and  some  others ,  a  thou-sand pounds'  worth  were  bought  on  the  opening  day.From  Mrs.  Abbey's  letters  again:  "November  8th. — Ned  had  aletter  to-day  from  the  President  of  the  Amsterdam  Society  of  Arts,'Ars  etAmicitia,' asking  him  to  do  five  drawings — black-and-white— subjects  to  be  taken  from  the  Bible,  and  offering  four  hundredguineas  for  the  five  drawings.  They  are  to  bring  out  an  illustratededition  of  the  Bible,  and  the 'swells 'of  all  nations  are  to  do  the  illus-trations. Here  Leighton,  Millais,  Tadema,  Sargent,  and  Ned  havebeen  asked;  I  don't  know  who  else.  Ned  has  also  received  a  noticethat  he  has  been  elected  an  honorary  member  of  the  American  So-ciety of  Architects .  H  e  thinks  this  a  great  honour . ' 'At  the  end  of  the  same  month ,  on  a  visit  to  London  for  VarnishingDay  at  the  old  Water-Colour  Society,  where  Abbey  was  exhibiting'  'A  Quiet  Conscience , "  Mrs .  Abbey  writes : '  'After  a  couple  of  hoursat  the  National  Gallery,  we  had  lunch  at  the  Cafe  Royal  and  thenwent  to  the 'Tower 'to  look  up  material  connected  with  the  time  ofHenry  VI.  and  Richard  1 1 1.,  but  found  very  little  there.

Onthe  whole  it  is  a  very  beautiful  book,  much  better  than  he  expectedit  would  be,  but  nothing  to  compare  with  what  Ned  wanted  if  thelimited  edition  had  been  got  out. "-  -This  refers  to  the  publication  ofthe  Comedies  in  book-form  at  the  end  of  this  year  (the  book  is  dated288THE  COMEDIES  PUBLISHED1896)  in  four  volumes,  the  production  of  which  Abbey's  old  asso-ciate, Anthony,  had  supervised  for  Messrs.  Harper.  The  title  pageruns  thus:  The  Comedies  of  William  Shakespeare:  With  many  draw-ings by  Edwin  A.  Abbey;  and  the  presentation  is  of  the  simplest —merely  Shakespeare's  text  and  Abbey's  drawings,  no  introductionand  no  preface.The  last  passage  to  be  quoted  from  Mrs.  Abbey's  letters  in  thisyear  (1895)  runs  thus:  "We  had  a  visit  from  OnslowFord.  Heisde-lighted  with  Ned's  picture,  and  has  asked  Ned  to  let  him  do  a  bustof  him,  so  Ned  will  sit  to  him  in  the  spring."During  1895  Abbey  was  elected  an  Associate  of  the  Royal  Water-Colour  Society ,  to  which,  in  the  following  year,  he  sent  "An  Atten-tion," and  later  this  was  purchased  by  Mr.  D.  D.  Robertson  for  awedding  present  to  his  wife,  and  is  now  in  the  possession  of  Mrs.Robertson,  of  3  Upper  Cheyne  Row,  London.CHAPTER  XXIXA.R.A.

As  we  have  seen,  he  hadbut  twice  exhibited  oil  paintings  there — the  "May-DayMorning"  in  1890,  and  "Fiammetta's  Song"  in  1894,  so  that,  sincethe  Academy  in  its  elections  does  not  take  note  of  water-colour  orblack-and-white,  it  may  be  gathered  that  the  Holy  Grail  frieze,  for-tified perhaps  by  the  pastels,  had  made  a  great  impression  on  hisfellow  artists.  How  brilliantly  he  was  to  justify  their  choice  of  himthe  next  Spring  exhibition  was  to  show.A  large  number  of  letters  and  telegrams  of  congratulation  weresent  to  the  new  A  .R  .A . ,  all  illustrating  the  affectionate  regard ,  as  wellas  esteem ,  in  which  he  was  held  by  those  already  among  the  elect ,  andtheir  pleasure  in  welcoming  him  to  their  company .Mr.  Solomon  J .  Solomon,  the  other  new  Associate,  paid  a  charm-ing compliment:  "Allow  me  to  congratulate  you,  and  tell  you  howproud  I  am  to  be  in  such  distinguished  company.  My  election  is  apromotion  for  me.  Yours  is  a  promotion  for  the  Academy."Alfred  Parsons  wrote  the  same  evening  from  the  Arts  Club ,  wherea  fitting  revel  was  in  progress : "  No  one  more  heartily  rej  oices  in  yourelection  to-night  than  I  do. .  .  .

And  to  Mrs.  Abbey  he  said:  "Let  me  congratulateyou  too ...  and  though  he  could  not  have  come  to  the  front  so  quickly290J.  E.  MILLAISin  a  new  line  without  his  wonderful  genius,  it  is  largely  the  result  ofthe  impetus  and  the  help  which  you  have  given  him."Mr.  Sargent,  who  had  first  telegraphed  to  Fairford,  wrote  later:  "Ihave  just  wired  you  the  joyful  news,  and  have  been  filling  glasses  foryou  here  and  very  inadequately  replied  in  your  name.  Everybody  isdelighted;  lots  of  men  told  me  to  send  you  messages,  and  I  have  beenshaking  hands  with  all  around  as  if  I  was  the  new  Associate."*There  was  no  President  of  the  Royal  Academy  at  that  moment,for  Leighton  had  just  died,  and  Millais,  who  was  already  under  thedark  cloud  of  the  malady  to  which  he  was  to  succumb  in  August ,  hadnot  been  officially  elected .  Millais  wrote  thus  to  the  new  Associate :' '  First  let  me  congratulate  the  Academy ,  and  then  you ,  on  your  elec-tion into  the  body .  We  were  all  delighted.  "And  that  no  one  was  moredelighted  than  Millais  himself  we  may  feel  certain,  for  in  the  bio-graphy of  thegreat  painter  by  his  son,  Mr.  John  Guille  Millais, is  thispassage,  to  which  an  allusion  has  already  been  made:  "As  to  Ed  winAbbey's  illustrations  m  Harper's  Magazine  of  the  old  English  songsand  the  plays  of  Shakespeare,  his  admiration  knew  no  bounds.  Ithink  I  may  say  that  he  frequently  urged  on  the  Academicians  Ab-bey's  right  to  become  an  Associate  even  on  the  merits  of  these  draw-ings alone;  and  that  he  has  now  attained  that  honour  is  perhaps  due,in  some  measure  at  least ,  to  Millais 's  championship  in  f  ormery  ears . ' 'The  most  interesting  of  Abbey 's  letters— at  any  rate,  of  those  thathave  been  preserved — in  reply  to  congratulations,  is  one  to  his  bro-ther. "I  am  very  proud,  "he  says,  "to  have  been  singled  out  amongso  many  aspirants  to  the  honour.  .  .  .  Leighton's  death  was  a  greatpersonal  loss .  I  had  no  kinder  friend ,  and  I  had  a  very  nice  note  fromhim  only  a  few  days  before  his  death .  He  was  really  an  extraordinaryman — methodical  to  the  last  degree — and  got  through  an  enormousamount  of  work  in  consequence.  In  the  House  of  Lords  he  wouldhavebeen  invaluable. "-—Leighton,  it  willbe  remembered, had  beenraised  to  the  peerage  only  a  few  days  before  his  fatal  seizure.  One  ofhis  last  letters  was  to  Abbey  thanking  him  for  his  good  wishes.From  Edward  Onslow  Ford,  the  sculptor,  came  this  superficially  cryptic,  but  easilydecipherable,  telegram  :  "  U.R.A.R.A.H.U.R.R.A.E.O.F."29IG.  F.  WATTSMrs.  Abbey 's  letters  to  Mrs.  Mead  again  come  to  our  assistance.On  January  1 2th  she  writes:  "Ned  has  been  painting  on  the  'Rich-ard' picture,  and  now  he  is  doing  in  pen  and  ink  Gideon,  with  theangel  of  the  Lord ,  bringing  fire  out  of  the  rock  he  has  smitten .  Thisis  for  the  Bible  illustration."On  January  2ist:  "Ned  at  work  on  the 'Castle  of  the  Maidens' to-day   Charles  Dana  Gibson  and  his  wife  came  down  on  Saturdayand  spent  Sunday."A  letter  arriving  at  this  time  from  G .  F .  Watts  to  Mrs .  Abbey  says :"We  have  constantly  been  on  the  point  of  askingyou  and  Mr.  Abbeyto  come  here  for  a  night  or  two,  but  something  has  always  croppedup  to  prevent  it.  I  am  so  terribly  in  the  habit  of  getting  ill — not  seri-ously, but  enough  to  make  visiting  or  inviting  out  of  the  question.As  to  visiting,  my  life  is  positively  bounded  by  my  studio,  where  Istill  hope  to  do  my  best  work  yet;  presumptuous,  perhaps,  as,  in  afew  days,  if  I  continue  in  life,  I  shall  reach  my  eightieth  year!  ...  Ihave  heard  a  great  deal  of  Mr.  Abbey's  work  —  it  is  enormouslythought  of.  Give  him  my  very  best  regards  and  remind  him  that  he  isto  sit  forme  to  finish  the  drawing  begun  or  for  a  new  and  better  one!"Another  letter  from  Watts  on  the  24th  covers  much  the  sameground,  but  has  this  interesting  addition:  "I  shall  have  some  thingstoshow.  Whether  they  will  be  cared  for  or  not,  I  am  not  equally  cer-tain, but  I  am  putting  out  all  my  strength,  and  hoping  to  do  betterthings  yet  than  I  have  done.  But,  within  a  few  days  of  my  eightiethyear,  though  not  too  late  for  effort — never  too  late  for  that — it  maybe  too  late  to  hope  for  improvement;  but  I  don't  think  so."-  —Wattslived  on  until  1904.These  letters  refer  to  the  charcoal  head  of  Abbey  which  Watts  hadmade  at  Little  Holland  House,  in  October,  1893,  and  with  which  hewas  not  quite  satisfied:  a  belated  wedding  present  from  "Signer""to  dear  Gertrude,"  his  "American  sister."  As  it  happened,  no  newone  was  ever  done.In  her  next  letter  Mrs.  Abbey  writes:  "Ned  is  working  againsttime  to  get  the  'Rebecca  and  Rowena'  drawing  off  to  Scribner's  bythis  post" — the  reference  being  to  a  request  from  Mr.  Burlingame292JOHN  HAYthat  Abbey  would  contribute  to  a  series  of  "Scenes  from  the  GreatNovels ' '  which  the  magazine  was  to  publish  .Abbey  chose  Ivanhoe .Vierge  illustrated  The  Three  Musketeers.On  February  i  ith  John  Hay  wrote  from  Washington.  "  I  havegone  twice  to  Boston  to  look  at  your '  Galahad '  series ,  with  new  plea-sure and  admiration  each  time.  You  have  done  the  job,  old  man.You  have  made  your  unquestionable  place  in  the  art  of  this  genera-tion. And  the  Shakespeare  drawings!  I  saw  a  few  of  them  at  a  pic-ture shop  here.  They  are  bully,  as  my  children  say,  in  a  languagewhich  I  used  to  think  h  ideous ,  but  which  seems  to  be  current  now  inthe  best  society.  Whom  do  they  belong  to?  and  are  they  ever  acces-sible to  the  pub  lie?  I  covet  some  of  them;  my  fingers  itch  for  them.  Ihave  the  book,  of  course,  and  take  great  comfort  in  it,  but  the  draw-ings have  a  grandiosity  and  style  that  are  extremely  captivating.  Wethought  of  you  very  often  when  we  were  in  Italy — particularly  in  theGiusti  Gardens  at  Verona.  .  .  .  The  choice  of  the  Laureate  [the  lateAlfred  Austin]  was  amazing — passing  over  Swinburne  and  Morris,who  were,  of  course  ,out  of  the  question, but  who  should  at  least  havekept  the  place  vacant  awhile.  There  was  Kipling,  a  glorious  youngcockerel  with  a  crow  like  a  spring  morning. "Three  or  four  weeks  later,  when  Abbey's  second  exhibition  ofpastels  was  opened  at  Avery's  in  New  York,  Hay  had  the  oppor-tunity of  buying  another  example  of  his  friend's  art.  Writing  to  tellthe  news,  he  says:  "Your  glorious  pastel  'The  Queen  in  Hamlet'hangs  in  front  of  me  while  I  write.  It  fills  the  room  with  splendour...  .  Helen  fell  in  love  with  it — me  too."Meanwhile  in  Paris  an  exhibition  was  being  held  of  the  originaldrawings  for  the  Comedies — inSalleXIofthePalaisdesBeauxArts.Writing  to  his  brother  Abbey  says  (on  March  25th)  that  "they  werehung  to-day ,  amid  the  cheers  of  the  populace — flag-flying,  guns  go-293ingforth,  babies  crying,  churches  closed,  etc.  I  was  notthereto  see."From  Mrs.  Abbey 's  letters  we  learn  that  early  in  this  year  Abbeybroke  the  rule  which  he  had  long  since  laid  down  for  himself,  not  toenter  for  competitions.  Having  a  rooted  belief  that  from  the  begin-ning of  the  Renaissance,  when  Ghiberti  instead  of  Brunelleschi  be-A  COMPETITIVE  DESIGNcame  the  successful  competitor  for  the  execution  of  the  gates  of  theBaptistry  of  San  Giovanni  in  Florence,  down  to  his  own  day,  com-petitions usually  resulted  in  the  selection  of  an  inferior  design,  hehad  sethis  face  against  them.  But  when  the  call  came  to  compete  forthe  decoration  of  the  Common  Council  Hall  of  Philadelphia  the  de-sire to  do  something  for  his  native  city,  and  to  set  his  mark  upon  it,overcame  his  reluctance,  and ,  though  pressed  for  time,  as  he  was  try-ing to  finish  his ' '  Richard ' '  for  the  Academy  at  the  end  of  March ,  hebegan  to  make  designs .  The  subj  ect  which  he  chose  was  the  Spirit  ofReligious  Liberty  leading  great  ships  across  the  sea  to  America,  ac-companied by  her  sisters,  Faith  and  Hope.  A  letter  of  Mrs.  Abbey 'ssays:  "Sargent  thinks  Ned's  design  is  stunning,  and  said  that,  ofcourse,  the  work  would  be  awarded  to  him,  but  I  doubt  if  the  jurywill  know  how  good  the  design  is.  I  heard  Sargent  tell  Ned  that  hethought  it  the  finest  notion  of  a  decoration  he  had  ever  seen."It  may  be  stated  here  that  Abbey  was  not  successful,  the  winner  ofthe  competition  being  Joseph  Decamp.  Writing  to  his  brother  hesay  s : ' '  That 's  all  right .  I  had  no  business  to  go  in  for  the  thing  any-way.  If  I  'd  got  it  to  do  it  would  have  been  quite  two  years  before  Icould  possibly  have  touched  it .  I  '11  write  to  you  shortly  what  to  dowith  the  sketches .  Jo  D  ecamp  is  a  good  chap ,  and  hasn  't  had  muchluck.  He  is  an  excellent  draughtsman  of  the  nude."  As  a  matter  offact  what  Philadelphia  rejected  Harrisburg,  the  capital  of  Pennsyl-vania, is  now  proud  to  own ,  for  the  main  lines  of  the  design  reappearin  one  of  the  most  beautiful  of  Abbey 's  decorations  there.All  this  while  th  e ' '  Richard ' '  was  nearing  completion :  but  not  with-out its  vicissitudes.  Owing  to  the  immense  amount  of  detail  to  bekept  in  mind  Abbey  had, by  an  oversight,  painted  the  gentlemen'shalberds  with  their  heads  upwards,  but  arms  are  reversed  at  fune-rals, and  it  was  therefore  necessary  to  scrape  these  out  and  repaintthem  heads  downwards.  There  were  difficulties  also  with  the  LadyAnne 's  dress ,  the  elaborately  embroidered  front  of  which ,  composedentirely  of  the  coat-of-arms,had  to  be  remade  and  painted  a  secondtime,  the  first  coat  having  belonged  to  a  wrong  branch  of  her  family.Then  the  model,  whom  Abbey  was  using  for  the  Lady  Anne's  face,294THE  "RICHARD"  COMPLETEDproved  a  disappointment,  and,  after  painting  from  her  daily  for  amonth,  he  had  to  make  a  change.  Scraping  out  all  he  had  done,  hebegan  again  with  a  new  model  ,this  time  completing  inasingle  sittingthe  face  as  it  now  is.  In  March  he  took  the  picture  to  Mr.  Sargent'sstudio  in  the  Fulham  Road  for  a  few  days,  whence  it  was  moved  forShow  Sunday  to  the  same  artist's  studio  at  33  Tite  Street.  Duringthe  fortnight  spent  in  town  Abbey  called  on  "over  fifty  R.A.'s  andA.R.A.'s,"  and  thus  did  his  duty  as  a  new  Associate.FromMrs.  Abbey's  letters  again:  "April  i4th. — SargentandMc-Kim  came  down  on  Saturday.  .  .  .  We  have  talked  and  talked  andtalked  and  talked,  and  we  had  much  delightful  music.  We  all  wentover  to  the  Hendersons  on  Sunday .  Ned  wanted  McKim  to  see  theBurne-Joneses  [the  Briar  Rose]  in  their  drawing-room.  Ned  wouldliketodoa  room  one  day."-  -This  was  at  Buscot  Park,  the  seat  of  SirAlexander  Henderson,  now  Lord  Faringdon,  and  the  reference  isto  Abbey's  desire,  expressed  in  a  letter  to  McKim  quoted  in  a  pre-vious chapter,  to  paint  subjects  from  Boccaccio  for  the  walls  of  somespacious  and  gracious  apartment.The  letter  continues:  "Next  week  Ned's  Varnishing  Days  begin.We  are  going  up  to  town  on  our  bicycles,  ninety-one  miles  by  road..  .  .Mitchell  goes  by  train  with  the  luggage." — Mitchell,  whohas  notbefore  been  mentioned ,  was  a  devoted  maid  of  the  house  upon  whoseministrations  not  a  little  of  its  comfort  depended.  She  is  still  withMrs.  Abbey .  Among  her  treasured  souvenirs  of  her  late  master  is  anoil  study  for  the  kneeling  Galahad  in  one  of  the  Grail  series.Of  Varnishing  Day  we  hear  from  Abbey  himself  in  a  letter  to  hisbrother:  "The  members  have  three  days  and  the  outsiders  one,which  makes  four  altogether.  One  sees  people  one  never  sees  on  anyother  occasion.  Old  T.S. Cooper — aged  93 — a  remarkable  relic—who  paints  better  than  he  ever  did;  which  isn't  remarkable  as  anartistic  result,  but  as  mere  handiwork  extraordinary.  Poor  Millais,who  is  slowly  dying  of  cancer  in  his  throat,  walked  round  the  exhi-bition one  day — I  dare  say  I  shall  never  see  him  again.  They  say  mypicture  has  made  a  hit — which  is  a  gratifying  thing  in  such  a  bigshow.  .  .  .  We  had  a  cricket  match  yesterday — an  el  even  of  painters295A  TRIUMPHversus  Chelsea  Arts  Club .  I  did  well :  first  ball  took  me  in  the  ribs ,and  ran  myself  out  on  a  measly  snick  in  the  slips  off  the  next;  long-stopped  for  the  fast  bowler,  and  let  nine  byes  and  made  one  catch.Agreatday.  I'm  black  and  blue  in  many  places.  .  .  ."And  so  we  come  to  the  opening  of  the  Academy  and  Abbey 's  firstappearance  on  its  walls  as  an  A.R.A.Mrs.  Abbey 's  next  letter  to  her  mother  tells  the  great  news:  "Mayist. — This  has  been  'Private  View'  day.  Ned's  'Richard'  has  beenthepictureof  the  year.  We  have  had  a  perfect  ovation.  .  .  .  Hewouldhave  had  his  head  turned  if  it  were  possible  to  turn  it,  but  it  is  notpossible."  If  there  had  been  any  doubt  in  the  Academy's  mind  as  towhetherit  had  acted  wisely  in  choosing  Abbey  as  anAssociate — andprobably  there  was  none — it  was  instantly  dispelled  by  this  contri-bution, which  enchanted  everyone,  both  artist  and  amateur.*  Fornot  only  was  the ' '  Richard ' '  masterly  in  execution  but  it  interpretedthe  national  poet  in  one  of  his  greatest  ironical  moments — when,even  as  the  funeral  procession  of  the  late  King,  Henry  VI.,  passedon  its  way  from  the  Tower  to  Chertsey,  the  Duke  of  Gloucester(afterwards  Richard  III.)  pressed  his  fantastic  love-making  on  theLady  Anne .  The  actual  lines  accompanying  the  canvas  were  these :Was  ever  Woman  in  this  humour  woo'd?Was  ever  Woman  in  this  humour  won  ?RICHARD  III.,  Act  I. ,Sc.  2.Among  the  tributes  from  fellow  artists  let  the  following  letter  fromMr.  Punch  in  his  praise  of  the  picture  packed  so  many  puns  into  one  paragraph  that  heshould  have  been  fined  for  overcrowding.  Thus  :  "No.  616.  Richard,  Duke  of  Gloucesterand  the  Lady  Anne.  Another  title :  Dick  and  Anne,  or  the  Double  Gloucester,  who  thinks  him-self quite  the  Cheese,  and  the  Lady  who  has  just  lost  a  Sovereign.  Had  the  artist  needed  a  lineof  popular  verse,  he  would  have  used, 'Dick  awry !  Dick  awry!  Dock!'  For  if  ever  villainought  to  have  ended  in  the  dock  and  been  found  guilty  it  was  that  accomplished  scoundrel,'afterwards  Richard  the  Third.'  A  marvellous  work  by  Edwin  A.  Abbey,  A.R.A.  This  willbe  the  talk  of  the  public.  The  scene  is  in  London,  probably  in  the  vicinity  of  Westminster,the  situation  being  from  Richard  the  Third,  Act  I.,  Scene  2,  and  will  entitle  the  Americanartist  to  be  remembered  ever  after  as  'Westminster  Abbey.'  This  is  the  picture  of  the  year.Most  certainly  it  is  the  very  Abbeyest  of '  Abbey  Thoughts .'

Mr.McCulloch  had  been  unwilling  to  allow  it  to  go  to  the  Paris  Exhibi-tion of  1900,  much  to  Abbey's  disappointment,  but  after  McCul-loch's  death  it  was  exhibited  at  the  Salon,  and,  in  191 1 ,  it  took  itsplace  in  the  British  Section  of  the  International  Exhibition  in  Rome,and  later,  in  1911-1912,  it  was  hung  among  a  selection  of  Abbey'swork  in  the  Memorial  Exhibition  at  Burlington  House.The  last  time  that  the  public  had  a  chance  to  see  the  Duke  of  Glou-cester in  his  bizarre  courtship  was  at  Christie's  in  May,  1913 ,  whenthe  McCulloch  treasures  were  sold.  The  sale  was  on  May  23rd,29th,  and  3oth,  and  Abbey's  two  pictures— this  and  the  paintingfrom  King  Lear — opened  the  second  day .

In  Paris  they  saw  the  Salon,  with  another  of  Puvisde  Chavannes'  decorations  for  the  Boston  Library,  Ab-bey's Shakespeare  drawings,  and  a  Venetian  robe  of  signal  splen-dour,  to  which  Mrs  .Abbey  thus  refers  in  one  of  her  letters :"  One  endof  the  building  in  which  the  Salon  pictures  are  hung  is  devoted  toDecorative  Arts.  Very  few  people  seem  to  go  there,  but  we  go  everyyear.  This  time  we  saw  in  a  glass  case  a  splendid  red  damask  Vene-tian senator's  robe  of  the  sixteenth  century.  Ned  needs  preciselysucharobe.  We  thought  it  just  possible  they  would  let  us  take  it  outof  its  case  to  see  how  it  was  made.  We  applied  to  the  Director  of  theMuseum,  who  not  only  let  us  have  it  out,  but  allowed  us  to  cut  thepattern.  .On  returning  home  they  found  the  announcement  of  the  death  ofWhistler 's  wife.  In  response  to  a  letter  of  sympathy  ,theartist  wrote:"Mv  DEAR  KIND  FRIENDS,.  .""You  will  know,  I  am  sure,  that  though  I  cannot  well  write  manywords  to  you,  I  was  much  touched  by  your  letter."You  have  seen  us  in  our  home  and  can  understand  that,  alone,  Iam  but  a  forlorn  reminder  of  the  brightness  that  charmed  you  andall  who  came  to  us!"Still,  I  would  like  to  see  you.

For  the  most  part  they  touch  upon  the  day's  achieve-ments in  the  studio,  such  recreations  as  cricket,  cycling  to  Ciren-cester,  Stow -on -the -Wold,  and  so  forth,  and  dining  at  variousneighbouring  houses;  but  here  is  an  extract  which  may  justly  becalled  historic.  The  lamented  and  tragic  death  of  Millais,  who  hadbeen  President  of  the  Royal  Academy  for  so  short  a  time,  occurredon  August  1 3th  at  the  age  of  sixty-seven.  A  week  later  he  was  buriedwith  full  pomp  in  St .  Paul 's .  Abb  ey  was  among  the  mourners ,  andfromhis  letter  toMrs.  Abbey, describing  the  ceremony, I  now  quote:"I  went  round  early  (to  the  R.A.)and  found  old  Dobson  there,  whowas  an  elder  student  at  the  R  .A .  when  Millais  came  there  as  a  littleboy.  Then  one  by  one  the  company  assembled.  No  one  there  butthe  members  and  the  representatives  of  the 'Beaux  Arts.'  .  .  .  Thenwe  went  down  to  the  carriages  which  filled  the  court.  We  joined  theprocession  as  it  came  from  Kensington.  The  streets  crammed  withpeople.  I  rode  with  Solomon.,  and  it  was  a  curious  sensation  havingall  those  eyes  curiously  looking  at  you,  every  eye  all  along  the  routestaring  right  at  you .  I  was  ready  to  shriek  by  the  time  we  reached  St.Paul's.  The  big  west  door  was  open,  and  we  filed  in  behind  the  pro-cession of  people  who  had  come  from  the  house.  There  was  a  wideway  up  the  nave  barred  off,  and  the  trombone  quartette  was  playingthat  Beethoven  thing.  The  crowd  of  familiar  faces  along  the  bar-riers ,  and  the  music ,  and  the  big  solemn  place  were  too  much  for  mealtogether;  but  I  stood  it  all  right  then,  and  we  filed  to  the  right  and3 0 0THE  FUNERAL  OF  MILLAISleft  of  the  coffin,  which  I  now  saw  for  the  first  time,  in  the  centre  ofthe  space  under  the  dome .

But  for  the  very  first  time  since  you  went  2  way ,  dear,  I  feltthat  I  wanted  to  paint;  and  as  the  music  went  on  and  on  all  the  fidget  -tiness  and  despondency  seemed  to  blow  away,  and  I  longed  to  bedoing  again — and  to  be  doing  great  things  that  you  would  be  proudof — and  I  shall  too,  I  feel  and  know"Moody ,  the  Academy  b  eadle ,  stood  before  the  coffin  all  throughthe  service,  holding  up  the  big  wreath  of  bay  and  laurel  ...."We  came  down  the  nave  again  and  stood  upon  the  steps  while  thecarriages  came  up .

I  am  makingstudies  for  a  large  composition  for  the  decoration  of  the  Royal  Ex-change— a  commission  entrusted  to  me  by  the  Masters  and  Wardensof  the  Merchant  Taylors  and  Skinners  Companies .  It  represents  anincident  in  the  history  of  the  two  companies  during  the  reign  ofRichard  III.,  and  is  17  feet  high.  I  am  also  making  studies  for  thereredos  of  the  American  Church  in  Paris.  I  have  not  been  given  thecommission  yet,  but  am  only  working  on  the  preliminary  idea.  Theidea  is  a  triptych  with  a  Crucifixion  in  the  middle.  These,  with  thework  for  Boston,  still  far  from  accomplishment,  and  other  things —a  panel  for  Whitelaw  Reid's  house,  and  a  lot  of  illustrations  for  theAmsterdam  Bible — keep  my  nose  pretty  close,  and  I  cannot  seem  toget  through  with  it — any  of  it  these  days,  as  my  tendency  is  to  elabo-rate more  and  more;  and  with  a  more  chastened,  and,  I  hope, moreaustere  taste,  I  find  myself  difficult  to  satisfy."Gertrude  orders  every  thing  so  carefully  that  I  may  be  absolutelyundisturbed  in  my  work  that,nowthat  she  is  away  from  me,  I  realize,as  I  never  did  before,  the  mass  of  detail  she  keeps  away  from  mysight  and  knowledge.

The  subject  is  thereconciliation  of  the  two  Companies ,  aftera  period  of  enmity ,  causedby  a  quarrel  as  to  precedence  .The  triptych  for  the  American  Churchin  Paris  was,  as  we  shall  see,  to  give  the  artist  some  trouble,  and  wasnot  finished  for  several  years.3°3THE  AMSTERDAM  BIBLEThe  Amsterdam  Bible  requires  a  further  note.  The  project  hadbeen  first  bruited  to  the  artist  in  November,  1895,  when  the  Secre-tary of  the  Societe  Artistique,  "Ars  et  Amicitia,"  at  Amsterdam,wrote  to  Abbey  saying  that  a  large  illustrated  Bible  was  in  contem-plation ,  to  be  contributed  to  by  the  best  artists  of  the  day ,  and  editedby  Professor  Carel  L.  Dake,  the  Society's  President;  later  someeighty  subj  ects  from  the  Old  and  New  Testaments  were  divided  be-tween them, of  which  Abbey  was  invited  to  takefivefrom  the  Booksof Joshua,  Judges,  and  Kings,  and  upon  which  he  wasworking  at  in-tervals until  the  end  of  the  year.Abbey's  certificate  of  Associateship  of  the  Societe  Nationale  desBeaux  Arts  belongs  to  this  year  of  many  successes,  1896,  and  theletter  accompanying  the  Cross  of  the  Legion  d'Honneur,  which  wasconferred  on  July  25th,  is  dated  November  I9th,  also  1896.News  of  the  death  in  Paris  of  his  old  friend  and  colleague  at  Har-per's, Charles  S.  Reinhart,  prompted  this  passage  in  a  letter  fromAbbey  to  Mrs.  Abbey  on  September  nth:  "Poor  old  Reinhart'sdeath  has  brought  a  flood  of  memories  of  those  old  days  when  hewas  the  only  man  I  knew  who  had  been  abroad  and  had  seen  greatpainters  and  schools.  What  a  fortunate  chap  I  thought  him — andhow  I  used  to  wonder  at  his  lack  of  ambition.  I  was  fond  of  him,  inspite  of  his  faults .  But  we  don 't  usually  care  for  people  on  account  oftheir  virtues — more  of  ten  in  spite  of  their  faults."  Within  a  monthtwo  more  friends  died — William  Morris  on  October  3rd  and  Georgedu  Maurier  on  October  gth.The  letter  of  September  1 1  th  also  said : "  I  have  a  surprise  for  you—I  can't  wait  until  you  come,  but  this  is  it.

"Mrs.  Abbey  came  back  to  England  on  September  3oth,  and  aftera  day  or  so  in  London,  during  which  they  saw  Cymbeline  at  the  Ly-3°4A  TRIPTYCHceum ,  and  supped  with  Irving,  she  returned  to  her  home  and  a  sightof  the  surprises  which  Abbey's  letters  had  more  than  once  pro-mised, chief  among  which  was  a  triptych  in  her  boudoir  from  Ab-bey 's  hand : ' '  medieval  things ,  "as  she  told  Mrs .  Mead ,"  unfinished ,but  so  very,  very  beautiful — done  all  for  me,  never  to  be  sold.  Goldbackgrounds  in  all.  In  the  first,  a  girl  in  her  garden  kissing  a  letter,which  a  carrier  pigeonhad  brought ,  another  pigeon  j  ust  coming  withanother  letter.  In  the  next  picture  is  a  man  on  his  travels  through  awide  country,  carrying  a  large  basketful  of  carrier  pigeons  which  hesends  off  at  intervals,  one  pigeon  far  away  in  the  horizon,  anotherjust  loosed.  In  the  third  picture  the  man  is  dead,  killed  by  thieveswho  are  in  the  distance,  but  his  soul,  in  the  shape  of  a  white  dove,arises  and  flies  straight  away  to  his  lady  and  stays  with  her  for  ever-more— the  colour  of  all  most  beautiful.  .  .  .' '  The  great  surprise  in  the  studio  was  a  picture  for  next  year 's  Aca-demy, at  least  half  finished.  .  .  .  'WhoisSilvia,whatisShe?'  Thereare  six  or  seven  figures  in  it  coming  down  a  staircase,  Silvia  in  front,in  the  white  silk  dress  with  shot  flame  and  gold  Venetian  sleeves.Then  come  her  followers,  one  carrying  her  fan,  another  her  littledog,  and  three  others  with  musical  instruments  singing.  At  thebottom  of  the  staircase  two  gold- fluted  columns  and  a  pedestal,  onwhich  are  the  family  coats-of-arms — very  decorative.  The  canvasis  4  feet  square.  The  Boston  things  have  got  on  quite  a  good  deal,but  there  is  an  enormous  amount  to  be  done  on  them  yet.  TheBible  things  are  well  on — he  did  them  nearly  all  a  second  time;  heis  so  conscientious  about  his  work  !  Then  he  has  got  on  very  wellwith  the  Reid  picture ,  but  the  day  I  came  he  took  out  the  whole  back-ground, which  had  been  gilded  with  best  gold  and  covered  with  anelaborate  Italian  Renaissance  pattern.  He  was  not  satisfied  withthe  pattern,  and  now  it  is  regilded  and  a  new  pattern  is  to  be  put  indirectly.  Then  there  are  various  other  sketches — his  picture  called'  The  Dark  Ages,'  just  sketched  in,  some  little  sketches  for  the  trip-tych in  the  Church  in  Paris,  in  case  he  does  it,  and  a  good  largesketch  for  the  Merchant  Taylors  and  Skinners  panel  in  the  RoyalExchange305THE  "HAMLET"  BEGUN"October  i3th. — I  have  just  come  in  from  the  studio — have  beensitting  toNedforhalfanhour.

Be-hind attheleft,sittheKing  and  Queen  on  an  elaboratesort  of  throne,and  behind  Ophelia  and  Hamlet  are  Polonius,  Soldiers,  Courtiersand  Horatio —  the  front  of  the  picture  very  brilliant,  the  back  verymurky  and  mysterious    I  stopped  just  here  to  write  to  the  Storesfor  Ned,  to  enquire  whether  they  could  procure  three  wolfskinswith  the  heads  on — heads  not  to  be  stuffed.  He  wants  them  for  this'Hamlet'  picture.  I  had  a  new  black  velveteen  garment  made  forHamlet  to-day,  the  sleeves  faced  with  lilac  satin,  as  also  the  bottomof  the  garment.  He  must  have  a  new  dress  for  Ophelia."Upon  this  picture  Abbey  was  to  concentrate  for  the  next  twomonths  until  a  relapse  in  the  condition  of  Mrs.  Mead  in  Decembermade  it  necessary  for  her  daughter  again  to  cross  the  Atlantic,  andthis  time  Abbey  went  too.  The  crisis  was  safely  passed  when  theyarrived,  but  Mrs.  Mead  being  still  in  a  very  weak  state,  Abbey  de-cided to  remain  in  New  York,  and  he  sent  for  his  man  to  bring  the"Hamlet"  and  the"Pavane"and  the  "Silvia,"  and  all  the  necessarycostumes  that  he  might  go  on  with  his  work  there.  Mr.  ThomasShields  Clarke  put  his  studio  at  Abbey's  disposal,  and  it  was  therethat  the  "Hamlet"  progressed  (with  Mr.  Clarke's  little  daughter  asthe  child  who  stands  beside  the  jester).  There  too,  Abbey  finishedthe  "  Pav  ane ' '  for  Mr . Whitelaw  Reid ,  which  was  shown  at  the  SpringExhibition  of  the  National  Academy  of  Design.  During  this  winterMr.H.  A.C.Taylor,  for  whom  McKim,  Mead,  and  White  had  re-cently built  a  fine  house  at  No  3  East  7  ist  Street,  became  the  ownerof  "Fiammetta's  Song,"  and  at  the  same  time  commissioned  two3 0 6IN  NEW  YORKfurther  decorative  paintings,  the  three  to  fit  into  certain  wall  spacesin  his  drawing-room,  which  had  originally  been  intended  for  tapes-try. (One  of  these,  "A  Poet,  "was  finished  in  1 899,  and  the  other,  "AMeasure , "  in  1 904) .  The  Hamlet ,  however,  only  proceeded  towardscompletion,  the  head  of  Ophelia  undergoing  many  changes — oneday  nearly  finished,  only  to  be  ruthlessly  dealt  with  on  the  next,  andwhen, finally,  Abbey  sailed  with  his  wife  on  March  iyth  it  had  beencompletely  wiped  out.  Perhaps  the  trouble  was  partly  due  to  an  em-barrassing wealth  of  models,  for  so  many  charming  girls  from  theArt  Schools  flocked  to  Abbey 's  studio ,  and ,  in  the  hope  of  seeing  himat  work ,  offered  themselves  as  sitters ,  that  he  was  continually  seeingnew  ideal  characteristic  features .  And  the  same  frustrating  fate  pur-sued him  when  he  reached  London,  only  a  short  while  before  it  wastime  to  send  the  picture  to  the  Academy ,  for  its  wooden  case  being  toobig  for  the  luggage  van  of  the  passenger  train  from  Southampton,  ithad  tobeleft  behind  to  follow  later, and  was  threedays  on  thejourneywhileAbbeyandhismodelwaitedidleinMr.  Sargent's  FulhamRoadstudio.  Even  after  this  there  were  difficulties  and  more  repainting;but  it  eventually  reached  Burlington  House.  Mr.  Sargent  thought  itbetter  painted  than  the ' '  Richard . ' '  Tadema  and  Orchardson  wereboth  enthusiastic;  but  the  artist  was  not  satisfied,  and  he  not  onlyworked  upon  it  on  Varnishing  Day,  but  again  after  the  exhibition.The  Varnishing  Day  verdict,  however,  relieved  his  mind.

He  says  that  he  sees  now  the  old  king  seeingthe  Grail  after  Galahad  has  returned  to  the  Castle  and  has  askedthe  question.  He  means  to  make  the  Grail  Castle  people  long  andthin  with  draperies,  like  the  old  Byzantines,  like  the  people  on  the3 0 8CHARTRES  CATHEDRALwest  door  of  the  cathedral  atChartres.  We  bought  photographs  ofthem  in  order  to  study  the  details.  We  already  have  a  dress  whichwe  once  copied  from  these  very  people.  .  .  .  [Abbey  carried  out  thisscheme  in  the  large  painting  which  was  afterwards  discarded.]  Afete  was  going  on  because  it  was  Whit  Monday,  and  hundreds  ofpeople  brought  candles,  which  were  burning  all  day,  and  they  pro-duced such  a  beautiful  effect  thatNed  decided  toput  themallaroundthe  cross  in  the  last  picture  where  Galahad  sees  the  Grail."  -Thecompleted  design,  however,  did  not  admit  of  this.  "Yesterday  webought  a  most  beautiful  red  silk  Louis  XVth  dress  for  Ned  [now  inthe  London  Museum].

Weir ,  of  the  "  School  of  the  Fine  Arts, "  Yale  Univer-sity : ' '  It  gives  me  great  pleasure  to  inform  you  that  the  Faculty  of  theYaleSchoolof  the  FineArtshavepresentedyour  name  forthedegreeof  M  .A.  to  be  conferred  at  the  forthcoming  University  Commence-ment on  June  3  oth.

As  this  was  the  first  honorary  degree  ever  conferred  upon  anyartist  by  Yale  University ,  Abbey  felt  that  he  must  make  the  effort  tobe  there.  Although  the  time  was  short  he  sailed  with  his  wife  on  June1 9th,  went  at  once  to  the  country  home  of  Mrs.  Abbey's  parents  atGreenwich,  Connecticut,  when  a  fortnight  of  perfect  happinessfol-lowed.  In  New  Haven  old  friends  gathered  about  them,  and  theirwelcome  wasall  that  was  delightful .  They  were  theguests  of  Prof .  andMrs.  Weir .  The  boat  race  and  the  Yale  and  Harvard  base-ball  matchadded  zest  to  the  little  holiday .  As  a  mementoof  this  occasion,  Abbey3°9A  YALE  DEGREEplaced,  later,  in  the  "Yale  School  of  the  Fine  Arts"  his  pen-and-inkdrawing  of ' '  Rebecca  and  Rowena, "  which  had  been  published  thatyear,  and  he  made  a  pencil  drawing  of  Miss  Weir  for  his  hostess.ThefollowingaddresswasdeliveredbyProfessorGeorgeP.Fisherwhen  the  presentation  of  the  degree  was  made:"I  have  the  honour  to  present  to  you  for  the  degree  of  Master  ofArts  Mr .  Edwin  Austin  Abbey ,  whose  just  title  to  his  celebrity  as  anartist  is  equally  acknowledged  in  this  country  and  abroad.  It  is  byworks  of  peculiar  meritthatMr.  Abbey's  position  in  the  front  ranksof  American  painters  has  been  attained .  His  genius  as  an  illustrator,principally  of  Shakespeare  and  English  songs  and  tales,  is  insepar-able from  the  power  which  enables  him  in  imagination  to  producelife  in  past  times,  as  one  may  see  notably  in  his  works  relating  to  theeighteenth  century.  But  this  original  power  would  be  inadequatewere  it  not  allied  with  cultivation  of  a  high  order  and  patient  re-searches. Born  in  Philadelphia,  in  1 852 ,  and  having  been  a  pupil  inthe  Pennsylvania  Academy  of  Fine  Arts,  Mr.  Abbey  came  to  NewYork  in  February,  1871 ,  to  draw  for  Harper's  Weekly  [and  Maga-zine] .  For  the  last  nineteen  years  he  has  resided  chiefly  in  England.Of  his  work  in  the  department  of  illustration  familiar  examples  arethe  edition  of  Herrick's  poems,  of  Goldsmith's  play,  She  Stoops  toConquer,  and  of  all  the  Comedies  of  Shakespeare.  The  excellence  ofhis  productions  in  water  colour  is  hardly  less  marked.  Among  hispaintings  in  oil  it  is  sufficient  to  recall  the  mural  painting  of  surpass-inginterest,'The  Quest  of  theHoly  Grail, 'on  the  walls  of  the  BostonPublic  Library .  Medals  or  kindred  tokens  of  honour  have  been  be-stowed upon  Mr .  Abbey  at  the  Chicago  Exposition  and  at  the  princi-pal centres  of  art  in  Europe,  as  Munich,  Paris,  and  Berlin.  He  is  aChevalier  of  the  Legion  of  Honour  in  France,  is  an  honorary  mem-ber of  the  American  Water  Colour  Society,  an  honorary  member  ofthe  American  Institute  of  Architects,  and  an  Associate  of  the  Na-tional Society  'des  Beaux  Arts'  in  France.  Besides  other  honours  oflike  character  and  equal  significance,  Mr.  Abbey  has  lately  been  ac-corded the  distinction  of  being  made  an  Associate  member  of  theRoyal  Academy  of  Arts  in  England."3 1 0THE  "LEAR"  BEGINSAbbey  had  brought  with  him  the  cartoons  for  the  second  and  thirdBoccaccio  decorations  for  Mr.  Taylor's  house— "A  Poet"  and  "AMeasure"— and  these  he  set  in  their  places,  to  note  the  effect.From  Mrs.  Abbey's  first  letter  after  the  return  to  Morgan  Hall:"July zoth. —  .  .  .

They  make  afine  background  for  Galahad,  when,  in  the  last  painting,  he  sees  theGrail.  [The  Just  Men  afterwards  gave  place  to  Angels.]  The  twoTaylor  cartoons  have  been  done  over,  and  one  is  traced  on  the  can-vas.

Mrs.  Abbey  recordsTadema's  criticisms:  "He  would  not  let  Ned  touch  the  Ophelia'sface — thinks  it  beautiful;  wants  him  to  finish  certain  things  aboutOphelia's  dress,  arm,  etc.,  which,  at  one  time,  had  been  much  morefinished,  also  to  do  a  little  to  the  'Hamlet'  figure,  but  that  was  all.However,  Ned  is  at  this  moment  painting  the  whole  of  Ophelia'sdress  over  again.  We  sat  down  to  dinner,  which,  to  save  time,  wascarried  into  the  studio  in  front  of  the '  Hamlet'  and  when  we  had  halffinished ,  he,  having  got  rather  excited  over'  Silvia,  'which  he  thought113ALMA  TADEMAvery  beautiful —  better  painted  than  anything  Ned  had  done —  andalso,  having  caught  glimpses  of  the  Taylor  pictures  and,  being  de-lighted with  the  'Lear,'  suddenly  asked  what  was  the  latest  minutefor  sending  a  telegram .  I  told  him  he  must  send  it  at  once — that  therewould  be  just  time  to  get  it  to  the  office — the  'bus  was  already  at  thedoor — and  so,  at  the  eleventh  hour,  it  was  settled  that  he  was  to  stayuntil  the  next  evening.  It  is  such  a  help  and  comfort  to  have  anyonelike  Tadema  come  and  talk  things  over.  It  clears  the  atmosphere-settles  one's  mind  about  many  things,  even  when  one  differs  inopinion    He  told  me  that  when  Ned  left  Broadway,  the 'Ghost'of  the  place  changed — 'I  mean,'  he  added,  'the  Spirit  [geist]  of  theplace.'  You  know  that  sometimes  he  makes  funny  mistakes  in  hisEnglish.  ..."September  3rd. — Ned  is  painting  on  the  Hamlet  picture  fromamodel  named  Antonelli — an  Italian  something  likeColarossi.  Hehas  been  working  on  Horatio  and  the  man  next  to  him.  Yesterday  hedid  Hamlet's  legs  over.  .  .  .  We  are  starting  to  make  the  fool's  dressfor  the  Lear  picture.  It  was  a  long  time  before  Ned  could  decide, butnow  we  are  to  make  it  a  sort  of  patchwork  of  a  quantity  of  differentpieces  of  old  stuffs — some  that  we  got  in  Venice — and  I  think  it  willbe  very  good  indeed .  The  model  had  on  the  owl 's  dress  this  morn-ing (made  for  the  fool  in  the  'Arthur's  Round  Table'  painting)."  Inthe  end  another  dress  was  used.On  September  1 2th  Mrs.  Abbey  again  had  to  leave  her  husband,in  order  to  go  to  her  mother,  having  received  on  that  day  a  cable,telling  her  to  come  at  once,  and  this  time  she  remained  to  the  end,returning  just  before  Christmas.From  Abb  ey 's  letters  to  his  wife  a  numb  er  of  extracts  follow :  "Aftera  co  uple  of  days  in  London ,  judging  pictures  for  Pittsburgh ,  etc. ,"  hewrites  on  September  2  ist, "  I  bought,  in  Wardour  Street,  some  realamethysts — not  good  ones,  of  course — and  a  lot  of  old  cut  crystals,from  which  I  have  made  a  stunning  necklace.

I  do  work  prettyhard,  I  think,  but  I  only  feel  it  when  I  scrub  and  paint  and  scrape  andcannot  get  what  I  see  in  my  mind.  Then  I  get  tired,  and  those  twofaces  Goneril  and  Regan  have  been  the  mischief,  but  they  are  com-ing. The  hands  are  good,  I  think,  and  I  get  the  flesh  better."Another  great  figure  has  gone  .  .  .old  Sir  John  Gilbert — who  wasonly  eighty  after  all.  I  fancied  him  older.  A  greater  influence  in  theartistic  line  there  never  was — every  engraver  and  draughtsman  onwood  collected  his  things  that  ever  I  knew,  and  it  is  amazing  howmany  imitators  he  had .  I  only  met  him  once ,  and  he  was  pleased  tobe  complimentary —  I  should  be  curious  to  know  how  many  draw-ings he  made  on  wood .  The  Chronicle  says  30,000  for  the  IllustratedLondon  News  alone;  but  I  should  think  that  an  exaggeration — onethousand  a  year  for  thirty  years-! — but  he  certainly  did  an  immensenumber. "(It  is  interesting  to  note  that  one  of  the  library  editionsof  Shakespeare  which  Abbey  used  and  marked — Staunton's — hadGilbert's  drawings;  but  nothing  could  be  less  alike  than  these  twoillustrators.  How  many  drawings  Abbey  himself  made,  no  one  hastried  to  compute;  but  he  comes  high  among  the  prolific  giants,  andwhere  actual  strokes  are  concerned  perhaps  he  comes  first.  Theremust  literally  be  millions.)"I  discover  new  things  nearly  every  day,  and  wish  I  had  all  theBoston  stuff  back  again.  I  see  the  tone  of  it  better.  I  should  make  itsimpler  from  beginning  to  end.  I  think  part  of  the  reason  the  sky  isso  dull — (it  is  very  dull  now  being  pitch  dark) — is  that  the  trees  arelighter — more  light  in  them — and  that  very  likely  the  whole  tone  of"FAUST  AND  MARGARET"things  is  lighter  than  it  is  in  midsummer,  as  the  sky  reflects  what'sunder  it ,  or  the  clouds  do .

The  series,  unhappily,  wasnever  finished.3 1 6CHAPTER  XXXIROYAL  ACADEMICIAN1898    Aged  46Full  Academy  Honours — "King  Lear" — St.Gaudens— Charles  Parsons— The  RoyalAcademy  and  Nationality — American  Members — Abbey's  Diploma  PictureAB  BE Y ,  it  will  b  e  rememb  ered ,  had  b  een  made  an  Asso-ciate of  the  Royal  Academy  in  1896.  Full  membershipdoes  not  necessarily  follow,  and  when  it  does  is  usuallyafter  several  years,  but  in  Abbey's  case  the  advance  wasso  rapid  as  to  constitute  a  record,  his  promotion  to  full  Academyhonours  coming  on  July  ist,  1898,  filling  a  vacancy  caused  by  thedeath  of  Philip  Calderon .  Since  his  election  as  Associate  he  had  ex-hibited three  Shakespearian  pictures,  all  of  which  had  attractedmuch  notice — the  "Richard  "in  1896;  the  "Play  Scene  in  Hamlet"in  1 897 ;  and  this  year  ( 1 898) "  King  Lear 's  Daughters. "  To  the  Aca-demy of  1898  he  sent  also  "The  Bridge,  "which  is  now  in  the  publicgallery  at  CapeTown,  and  the  drawing  of  "Rebecca  andRowena"made  for  Scribner's  Magazine.Abbey 's  King  Lear  picture  in  the  Academy  for  1898  was  sold  be-fore exhibition  to  the  same  collector  who,  in  1896,  had  bought  the' '  Richard , ' '  the  late  George  McCulloch .  The  moment  chosen  is  thatin  which  Cordelia,  speaking  "sweet  and  low,"  says  to  her  sisters:Ye  jewels  of  our  father,  with  washed  eyesCordelia  leaves  y ou .  I  know  you  what  you  are :And,  like  a  sister,  am  most  loth  to  callYour  faults  as  they  are  named.  Love  well  our  father.To  your  professed  bosoms  I  commit  him.But  yet,  alas!  stood  I  within  his  grace,I  would  prefer  him  to  a  better  place.So  farewell  to  you  both.The  picture  was  next  exhibited  in  1 900  at  the  Guildhall;  also  at  theAcademy  winter  exhibition  of  the  McCulloch  Collection;  in  1 9 1 1  inVOL.  ii. — E  317ELECTED  TO  R.A.the  International  Exhibition  at  Rome;  and  again  at  the  Academy,after  the  painter's  death,  in  1911-1912.  In  1913  it  was,  with  the' '  Richard , ' '  sold  at  the  McCulloch  sale  at  Christie's .  It  subsequentlywas  presented,  by  the  late  George  A.  Hearn,  to  the  MetropolitanMuseum  in  New  York.Just  b  ef  ore  the  Academy  exhibition  in  July ,  Abb  ey  was  invited  bythe  Foreign  Architectural  Book  Society  to  be  their  painter  guest  atthe  annual  recreation  meeting ,  which  that  year  was  at  WollatonHall ,built  by  John  of  Padua ,  where  their  hosts  were  Lord  and  Lady  Mid-dleton .  This  invitation  he  accepted ,  and  then  hastened  to  town  forthe  election,  spending  the  intervening  hours  partly  at  Christie's  andpartly  at  Lord's.  The  following  letter  to  Mrs.  Abbey  tells  the  storyof  the  election:"!  wish  you  had  been  there  to  see  the  goings  on.  Idined  at  the  Arts  [Club]  with  Swan  and  Hunter  and  Crofts  and  Sar-gent, and  we  adjourned  to  the  Academy  shortly  after.  A  very  fullmeeting.  We  had  coffee  and  liqueurs  in  themembers'room — out  ofa  fine  old  coffee  pot — and  then  adjourned  to  Gallery  II.,  where  thelong  table  with  wax  candles  and  green  shades  was  placed  along  infront  of  my  picture.  The  first  ballot  was  scattering — nearly  all  of  ushad  a  vote  or  two— and  then  it  got  more  exciting ,  and  at  the  last  ballot,which  is  with  balls  in  a  ballot  box,  I  felt  myself  going  up.  Poyntercounted  Waterlow  first,  deliberately,  as  though  he  had  all  night  be-fore him,  and  then  I  was  counted,  and  Waterlow  was  the  first  tocongratulate  me,  and  they  all  crowded  round  and  shook  hands.  Wewent  up  to  the  Club  and  I  made  a  speech  and  blew  'em  off.  I  walkedup  with  Waterlow  and  Swan,  and  really  I  don't  believe  there  is  ashred  of  j  ealousy  in  their  natures. '  '-—Of  the  painters  mentioned  onlyone  survives — Mr.  Sargent.Since  Abbey  was  present  at  his  election  as  Royal  Academician  hewas  in  aposition  to  be  felicitated  in  person,  as  hehad  notbeenwhenhebecame  an  Associate,  and  there  were, therefore, not  so  many  writ-ten messages  of  congratulation  as  before.  Two  American  congratu-lations I  should  like  to  quote.  One  came  from  the  sculptor  St.  Gau-dens,  who,  with  Mrs.  St.  Gaudens,  had  been  at  Morgan  Hall  in  thepreceding  month:AN  ACADEMICIAN'S  DUTIES"  ABBE  Y  DEAR  R.  A.,"Here's  to  the  Royal  Academy — they  know  a  good  thing  whenthey  see  it.  "Thine,"July  6th,  1898."  "A.ST.GAUDENS.The  other  came  from  Charles  Parsons  in  his  retirement:  "I ,  as  oneof  your  oldest  friends ,  who  have  watched  your  career  from  the  earlyFranklin  Square  days,  most  sincerely  congratulate  you  on  this  de-served honour.  You  are  always  with  me,  here  in  my  country  home,many  of  your  early  drawings  are  hanging  on  the  walls  of  our  cottage— drawings  I  purchased  attheFletcher  Harper's  sale,andother giftsfrom  you  .  ..among  themTrideonherbrow,"YeBellman,'andthegirl  and  little  brother  asleep,  with  the  old  parson  droning  away  inthe  pulpit"  ['The  Day  of  Rest'].Certain  of  Abbey's  replies  to  congratulations  of  this  year  havebeen  preserved.  Thus,  to  John  Hay  he  wrote:"!  value  your  kindwishes  very  highly.  The  honour  was  not  expected  quite  so  soon,  andI  can't  say  that  I  feel  altogether  comfortable  to  have  jumped  over  somany  of  my  seniors,  but  the  good  opinion  of  one's  fellow  workers  isa  very  heartening  thing,  and  I  hope  I  shall  not  disappoint  them.  "Hereturned  to  this  point  in  a  long  letter  to  Charles  Parsons  on  July  1 8th :"It  is  good  to  see  your  once  so  familiar  handwriting  again,  and  Ithank  you  very  much  for  the  keenly  appreciated  kind  messages  itconveys  to  me.  It  was  a  great  surprise  to  me,  and  not  an  altogethercomfortable  one,  being  passed  in  over  the  heads  of  twenty  men  myseniors — for  unless  there  is  some  very  vital  reason,  the  election  tomembership  is  takenin  order  of  precedence.

I  dare  say  it  might  be  called  literary.So  soon  as  one  begins  to  mean  something  it  seems  one  is 'literary.'But  one  has  to  do  what  one  must  do.  If  my  instincts  present  thesepictures  before  my  eyes,  I  can't  turn  my  back  on  them.  If  I'm  verymuch  interested  in  them,  as  I  am,  it  would  be  absurd  to  try  to  dosomething  I  'm  not  particularly  interested  in.  People  seem  to  look  atthem  and  be  interested  in  them  too,  which  some  might  say  is  a  proofof  this  lack  of  righteous  aim."Sargent  is  marvellously  strong  this  year.  One  doesn't  knowwhere  he  will  stop .  There  is  a  deeper  note  in  some  of  his  portraitsthan  he  has  heretofore  touched.  He  is  the  same  generous,  simple-minded  fellow,  with  all  his  magnificent  position.  St.  Gaudens  hasbeen  with  me  for  a  few  days ..  .  the  sculptors  here  were  delighted  tosee  him .  He  is  going  to  do  the  R .  L .  Stevenson  monument  for  Edin-burgh. Alfred  [Parsons]  painted  a  fine,  big  picture  of  rolling  hillsand  wooded  vales — and  is  hard  at  work  on  studies  of  gardens,  inwhich  he  delights — not  only  himself  but  other  people."I  saw  Cable  in  London.  I'd  never  met  him  before,  and  was  de-lighted with  him.  Hehas  been  Barrie's  guest."— Mr.  G.W.  Cable,the  novelist  of  New  Orleans  life,  had  been  conquering  literary  Lon-don that  spring.TheRoyal  Academy  was  proudof  its  newmember  and  Abbey  wasproud  of  the  Royal  Academy.  Indeed, heworked  hard  for  it  and  wasnot  less  jealous  of  its  honour  than  many  an  English-born  Academi-cian. The  President  during  Abbey's  day,  the  late  Sir  EdwardPoyn-ter,  told  me  that  he  valued  the  counsel  of  this  American  colleaguevery  highly,  so  shrewd  and  sound  and  wise,  equally  free  from  fadsand  any  tendency  to  pull  wires ,  did  he  find  him .Apropos  of  nationality,  it  is  rather  curious  that  of  the  very  fewAmericans  who  have  become  Royal  Academicians — not  more  thanten,  even  when  Boughton(who  was  of  English  birth),  and  Copley(whowas  born  in  Boston  whenit  belonged  to  England),  and  Wash-ington Allston  (who  was  only  A.R.A.)  are  counted —  four  at  leastshould  have  been  historical  painters  and  should  have  been  singledout  as  subjects  of  Royal  patronage.  Thus,  Benjamin  West,  P. R.A.3 2 0AMERICAN  R.A.'s(1738-1 820) ,  who ,  like  Copley ,  although  American,  was  a  Colonial ,and, likeAbbey,aPennsylvanian,and  painted  picturesfor his  State,was  appointed  historical  painter  to  George  III;  John  SingletonCopley,  R.A.  (1737-1815),  who,  like  Abbey,  is  represented  in  theBoston  Public  Library,  was  an  historical  painter  who  received  com-missions fromGeorgeIII;CharlesRobertLeslie,R.A.  (1794-1859),an  American  by  parentage  although  born  in  London,  was  chosen  topaint  both  "Queen  Victoria  receiving  the  Sacrament  at  her  Coro-nation" and  the  "Christening  of  the  Princess  Royal, "in  1841;  andEdwin  Austin  Abbey,  R.A.,  painted  in  1902,  the  official  picture  ofthe  Coronation  of  Edward  VII .One  of  the  rules  of  theRoyal  Academy  is  that  no  Academician  electshall  receive  his  diploma  until  he  has  presented  the  institution  with  a"specimen  of  his  abilities"  to  be  preserved  in  the  Diploma  Gallery.The  rule  says  further  that  this  deed  shall  be  performed  within  sixmonths  of  election,  "in  failure  of  which  his  election  shall  becomevoid ,  unless  such  an  apology  b  e  made  by  him  for  the  omission  as  maybe  deemed  sufficient  by  the  Committee."  It  is,  however, permittedto  deposit  a  work  of  art  as  an  earnest  of  the  one  specially  to  be  ex-ecuted. Abbey 'sfirstidea  was  to  paintSt. Luke,  who  is  fabled  to  haveb  een  a  p ainter  and  is  th e  tutelary  g enius  of  artists ,  and  some  progresswas  made  with  this  picture;  but  on  this  occasion  the  evangelist  wasless  helpful  to  his  follower  than  h  e  should  have  b  een ,  and  th  e  p  roj  ectwas  abandoned.  I  nits  stead  Abbey  sent,  inNovember,  1899,"  ALutePlayer,"  which  may  be  seen  in  its  place  among  the  other  diplomaworks;  but  although  he  took  great  pains  he  was  never  satisfied  withit .  His  diploma  was  signedby  Queen  Victoria  on  D  ecemb  er4th  ,1899.CHAPTER  XXXIICRICKET1 898  and  LaterABBEY,  as  we  have  seen,  was  elected  R.A.on  July  ist,1898.  InalettertoMr.SpielmannJuly  1 3th,  thankinghim  for  his  congratulations  on  that  event,  he  wrote:"Next  week  the  cricketing  artists  are  to  visit  us  and  playfour  cricket  matches  in  the  neighbourhood,  and  I  request  yourprayers  for  the  triumph  of  Art .  "To  anAmerican  friend  he  also  wroteof  the  forthcoming  matches,  adding  that  cricket"takesthemindoffthe  things  of  this  world,  such  as  paint  and  models"-— a  sentimentwhich  was  to  develop  into  a  creed,  for  it  was  during  this  week  ofenergy  in  the  field  that  Abbey  both  founded  the  Artists'  CricketClub  and  established  the  custom  of  an  annual  cricket  festival  of  hisown  at  Morgan  Hall.Cricket,  as  we  know,  had  always  had  for  him  a  fascination  whichin  an  American  was  extraordinary .  Most  of  our  cousins  from  acrossthe  Atlantic  who  are  led ,  with  reluctant  feet,  to  Lord 's  make  humor-ous remarks  upon  the  English  people's  love  of  leisure  even  in  theirsports.  They  missthe  stimulating  presence  of  basebair'fans,"  andaffect  to  swoon  when  they  are  told  that  a  match  lasts  three  days,  andis  often  not  finished  then.  Philadelphia,  however,  has  always  num-bered a  few  of  the  righteous,  and  Abbey,  coming  from  that  city,brought  to  this  country,  along  with  all  his  love  of  baseball,  a  certainsympathetic  receptivity  for  thealiengame.Tobaseballheremainedtrue:  he  kept  its  paraphernalia  at  Morgan  Hall,  and  was  always  de-lighted to  entertain  American  players  there;  but,  like  the  energeticand  very  practical  man  that  he  was,  instead  of  merely  bemoaning  theabsence  of  the  national  pastime  of  his  own  race  he  threw  himselfwith  zest  into  that  of  the  Old  Country .  For  many  years  he  had  lovedcricket,  both  practically  and  theoretically —  during  the  summermonths  instinctively  opening  his  paper,  as  all  true  devotees  of  thegame  must  ever  do,  at  yesterday's  scores  rather  than  at  yesterday's322A  CAPTAIN'S  TACTdebates ;  but  until  1 896  he  play  ed  only  very  occasionally .  Now ,  how-ever, that  he  was  a  full  R.A.  and  had  won  his  way  through,  he  wasentitled  to  a  little  indulgence.  Henceforward,  although  at  an  agewhen  the  first-class  player  (always  excepting  "W.G.")  is  too  old,  hewould  not  merely  put  on  his  flannels  whenever  the  chance  came ,  butwould  make  chances  too.*The  four  matches  of  the  first  Fairford  week  were  duly  played  inJuly,  the  artists  beingE.A.Abbey,R.A.,  W.Dacres  Adams,  R.T.Blomfield,  the  architect  (now  Sir  Reginald  and  R.A.),  ArnesbyBrown, the  landscape  painter  (now  R.  A. ),E.  H.H.Bruce,  Henry  J.Ford,  famous  as  the  illustrator  of  Andrew  Lang's  Blue,  Red,  Green,and  other  coloured  Fairy  Books ,  G .  Gascoyne,  G .  H .  Swinstead ,  A .Chevalier  Tayler,  and  F.H.Townsend,  the  present  Art  Editor  ofPunch.  Later  the  composition  of  the  Morgan  Hall  teams  changed,Dermod  O'Brien,  now  President  of  the  Royal  Hibernian  Academy,the  late  Walter  Osborne,  the  Irish  painter,  the  late  Arthur  ("Peter")Studd,  and  others,  coming  in.The  first  match  was  against  Mr.  Audley  Miller's  Eleven,  and  wasbadly  lost,  the  Artists  making  only  38  to  23 1 :  E.  A.  Abbey ,  stumpedby  Captain  Clever  off  Harold  Milward's  bowling,  7 — the  secondhighest  score  of  the  side,  and  one  of  the  highest  that  he  ever  made.Audley  Miller, by  the  way,  was  captain  of  the  Wiltshire  Wanderers,and  one  of  Abb  ey  's  letters  to  his  wife  tells  of  a  dinner  p  arty  at  whichthey  were  present  when  Abbey,  referring  to  some  past  match  inwhich  they  had  been  on  the  same  side,  said  that  he  hoped  Mr.  Millerhad  forgiven  him  for  missing  that  catch.  "With  a  charming  smileacross  the  table  he  said,  'But  you  made  such  a  beautiful  one  imme-diately afterwards  that  I  'd  quite  forgotten  the  miss,'  and  I  sat  there[Abbey  continues]  and  took  it,  and  never  made  any  catch  at  all !  Itseemed  to  me  rather  neat. "The  second  match  was  against  Mr.  J.Henderson's  Eleven,  and\vas  won  by  the  Artists,  the  highest  score  in  their  first  innings  beingHow  pleased  would  he  be  to  know  that  Wisden's  alphabetical  list  of  eminent  cricketers,living  and  dead,  from  the  earliest  times,  begins  every  year  with  "Abbey,  Mr.  E.

So  ended  the  1898  and  first  cricket  week  at  MorganHall.There  have  been  unhappy,  gloomy,  and  jealous  painters — suchnotable  examples  as  Barry  and  Haydon  leap  to  the  mind — but, takenas  a  whole,  artists  are  a  contented  and  friendly  folk,  asking  not  toomuch  of  life  and  pleased  to  see  each  other  and  pleased  to  praise  eachother.  A  certain  simplicity,  radiance,  and  spaciousness  that  dis-tinguish them  we  may  perhaps  attribute  in  some  degree  to  the  cir-cumstance that  they  are  concerned  chiefly  with  the  visible  worldand  with  b  eauty ,  that  most  of  them  work  only  when  it  is  light ,  havingtheir  evenings  free  for  social  intercourse;  and  that  they  work  also  inimmense  airy  rooms,  planned  on  the  grand  scale,  whereas  (but  Ihasten  to  say  that  I  am  instituting  no  comparisons)  literary  men,  forexample,  are  perplexed  by  introspection  and  often  toil  far  into  thenight  in  minute  or  over-furnished  apartments.  Be  the  reasons  whatthey  may,  the  fact  remains  that  artists  are  good  company  even  forstrangers,  and  among  themselves  appear  to  be  the  j oiliest  of  men.We  have  already  had  proofs  in  profusion  that  Abbey  was  the  soulof  camaraderie.  We  have  seen  him  gay  with  the  other  young  artistsatHarpers';attheTileClub  meetings  and  excursions;  at  Boughton'sparties  in  Kensington;  with  the  circle  at  Broadway.  Everywhere  hemade  friends  and  kept  them .  But  he  can  never  have  been  happier—nor  could  his  fellow  artists  have  been  happier — than  in  the  cricketfield  at  Morgan  Hall.  Not  a  little  of  his  joy  in  the  game,  and  conse-quent high  spirits,  is  to  be  recaptured  from  reminiscences  of  theseFairford  weeks  which  have  kindly  been  written  for  this  book  by  cer-tain of  his  fellow-players.324G.  H.  SWINSTEADMr.  Swinstead,  for  example,  who  was  a  tower  of  strength  in  thefield,  for  he  was  a  tireless  and  (as  I,  myself,  can  testify)  a  very  wilybowler,  a  sagacious  captain  and  a  desperately  difficult  man  to  getout,  writes  thus  of  his  host:  "Abbey's  enthusiasm  for  cricket  was  anoutstanding  feature  in  his  broad  and  genial  outlook  upon  life.  Thisenthusiasm  was  quite  in  harmony  with  the  intense  vitality  of  his  art.Being  a  man  full  of  life  and  energy  himself,  he  realised  the  danger  ofan  artist  becoming  narrow-minded,  rusty,  and  self-absorbed,  andsaw  in  the  recreative  effect  of  air  and  exercise  the  necessary  phy-sical and  mental  help  to  creative  power.  It  was  cricket  that  gatheredaround  him  some  of  the  men  he  most  liked ,  and  he  realised  its  demo-cracy too— how  it  brings  people  into  social  intercourse  and  placesmen  on  the  same  footing  immediately.  Many  of  us  found  lifelongfriendships  there  and  look  back  on  those  days  as  some  of  the  happiestin  our  lives."In  the  spring  of  1 898  he  came  to  me,  all  smiles  and  full  of  enthu-siasm, to  tell  me  he  hoped  to  have  an  artists'  cricket  week  down  athis  place  at  Fairford.  '  Would  you  come  and  join  in  thefun?' said  he.'If  I  can  fix  the  weekperhapsyou  will  comedown  aday  or  twobeforethe  others ,  and  help  me  arrange  things .  Fisher  [his  handy  man]  andI  have  been  preparing  the  pitch  all  the  winter,  and  I  think  it  will  bepretty  good  by  the  time.  I  won't  say  much  about  the  out-fielding,but  it  has  its  own  picturesque  footing. ' 'I  might  interpolate  the  remark  that  Abb  ey  had  practical  advice  asto  the  formation  of  his  cricket  pitch  from  a  neighbouring  cricketerand  friend ,  the  late  J .  Arthur  Gibbs ,  who  played  a  little  for  Glouces-tershire and  wrote  A  Cotswold  Village,  that  admirable  book.  Allthrough  the  year  this  pitch  was  a  source  of  anxiety ,  and  Abb  ey  neverlet  a  day  go  by,  when  he  was  at  home,  without  visiting  it,  pulling  upa  plantain,  pressing  down  a  lump,  or  paying  it  some  other  intimateattention.  There  was  steady  rolling,  too,  not  always  without  inci-dent, for  I  find  among  the  correspondence  a  letter  of  Abbey 's  to  hisbrother-in-law,  Mr.  Frederick  Mead,  wherein  a  mishap  is  not  onlyrecorded  but  illustrated.  "To  add  to  our  trouble,  the  weight  onthe  roller  slid  back  this  morning  and  nearly  hung  the  horse    If325AN  EQUINE  TRAGEDYhe  hadn't  been  cut  down  he  would  have  been  hung.  He  broke  one  ofthe  iron  shafts.  The  lawn-mower  he  was  to  have  toyed  with  hadn'tcome.  He  is  a  hired  steed — and  if  he  had  died  no  doubt  he  would  haveturned  out  very  valuable.  The  boywho  lies  on  the  ground  is  of  no  value . ' ''  'How,"  Mr.  Swinstead  continues,"Abbey  ferreted  out  enough  artistswhocouldplaycricketwasthenamys-tery,  but  the  side  which  turned  outwas  quite  a  good  one.  Our  ages  rangedbetween  thirty  and  fifty ,  but  we  play-ed a  solid  week's  cricket,  putting  up  agood  fight  every  time."  Luncheon  was  held  in  the  great70  feet  studio,  where  the  twenty-twomen  [together  with  Mrs.  Abbey,  theumpires,  scorers,  and  two  or  threestray  guests] ,  sat  down  at  one  long  table  on  all  sorts  of  seats  andbenches,  ranging  in  period  from  Henry  IV.  to  Victoria.  A  more  un-usual and  picturesque  cricket-luncheon  never  was,  and  very  littleart-talk  was  indulged  in,  although  five  or  six  huge  paintings  of  the'Quest  of  theHoly  Grail' stood  silently  round. 'Thosebig  things  takeit  out  of  me.  I  feel  like  a  fly  crawling  about  on  them,'  Abbey  oncesaid  with  a  broad  smile .  The  only  brush  that  he  touched  during  thatweek,  however,  was  the  one  belonging  to  the  whitewash  pail,  whenhe  would  mark  the  crease."The  evenings  were  no  less  full  of  fun  and  incident  than  the  day-time. Life  was  always  breezy  and  interesting  where  Abbey  was, andmusic,  charades,  mock-trials,  and  improvised  recitatives  on  the  cric-ket incidents  of  the  day  filled  the  time ,  until ,  smoking  our  last  pipes ,we  wandered  off  to  b  ed ."Abbey  was  not  a  great  batsman  and,  like  all  great  men,  was  ex-ceedingly modest.  He  always  insisted  on  going  in  last,  and  as  a  con-sequence he  was  often '  not  out ' ;  but  when  he  made  a  few  runs  hisjolly  smile  showed  how  pleased  he  was.  His  fielding,  catching  and326A  CRICKET  REFORMERthrowing  were  excellent.  He  often  buzzed  the  ball  in  at  a  rate  thatsurprised  the  wicket-keeper,  and ,  always  alert  in  his  place  in  the  field,he  took  the  keenest  interest  in  the  progress  of  the  game.  Though  hepreferred  not  to  captain  the  side,  and  asked  me  to  do  so,  he  wouldoften  make  valuable  suggestions  as  to  change  of  bowling  or  placing  inthe  field .  His  intense  interest  in  the  match  was  perhaps  greater  thananyone  else's.  One  catch  he  made  will  never  be  forgotten  by  thosewho  were  playing  in  the  match  Artists  v.  Musicians  on  the  Hamp-stead  ground.  I  started  the  bowling  against  the  best  man  on  theirside — a  really  fine  player.  Abb  ey  had  asked  to  go  to  the  out-field ,  andwas  right  down  at  deep  long-leg,  on  squishy  ground.  My  first  de-livery fortunately  slipped  out  of  my  hand,  and  the  result  was  a  fulltoss  on  the  leg-side,  just  the  right  height  for  a  swinging  hit,  which  thebatsman  laid  on  to.  A  very  fine  hit — but  it  was  his  only  and  partingshot.  It  rose  high,  swerved  a  bit,  and  fell  straight  for  our  president.Abbey  moved  a  pace  or  two  and,  to  our  amazement,  got  it.  It  was  acatch  worthy  of  an  all-England  player."Abbey  knew  the  game  well,  and  it  was  always  a  pleasure  to  himto  know  what  the  best  players  were  doing  and  what  was  going  on  inthe  cricket  world.  He  had  a  very  definite  opinion  that  cricket-ruleswanted  altering,  and  that  the  game  generally  needed  speeding  up.In  1901  he  wrote  to  me:  'All  cricketing  rules  seem  to  be  made  for  the200  odd  men  who  play  in  particular  matches.  The  200,000  otherswho  try  to  make  a  game  in  one  day  are  not  considered  at  all .  Write  tothe  Times — it  is  time  we  had  something  done  for  us."One  of  Abbey 's  reforms  was  tried  with  success  in  a  match  duringthe  "week"  of  1901 ,  and  Mr.  Swinstead  wrote  a  letter  to  the  editorof  Cricket  describing  it.  In  order  that  everyone  might  have  a  chanceof  batting  it  was  arranged  that  at  the  fall  of  the  fifth  wicket  the  otherside  should  come  in,  terminating  their  innings  also  at  the  fall  of  thefifth  wick  et(or  by  declaration  earlier) .  The  first  side  then  resumed  itsinnings  with  the  not-out  man  until  the  next  five  wickets  had  fallen,andsoon.  This  plan  was  found  to  work  very  merrily.  I  am  not  awarethat  it  has  been  adopted;  but  at  Winchester  they  have,  in  their  housematches,  a  somewhat  similar  scheme  which  divides  the  time  avail-327ARTHUR  STUDDable  for  play  into  two  exact  halves,  each  side,  unless  disposed  ofbefore,  thus  having  the  same  batting  period.  Abbey's  device  seemsto  me  better,  for  it  practically  ensures  an  innings  to  everyone  andvaries  what  is  to  many  (but  never  to  the  real  devotee)  the  monotonyof  fielding.From  the  impressions  of  Abbey  and  the  Fairford  "weeks"  whichother  of  the  Artists  have  written,  I  am  forced  reluctantly  to  omit  agreat  deal,  because — all  covering  the  same  ground — it  is  repetitive.ButI  must  not  omit  all.  ThelateArthurStudd,affectionatelyknownas  "Peter,"  a  member  of  a  family  whose  name  is  inseparably  asso-ciated with  cricket  triumphs ,  wrote : "  The  Artists  was  the  only  elevenI  ever  played  with  where,  in  spite  of  the  keen  desire  to  win,  the  sym-pathy of  the  field  was  entirely  with  the  member  who  had  the  misfor-tune to  miss  a  catch .  That  was  no  doubt  b  ecause ,  b  eing  artists ,  we  feltthat  it  was  particularly  human  to  err .  We  all  f  elt . ' '  added  Mr.  Studd ,"proud  of  the  presidence  of  Mrs.  Abbey,  who,  whilst  she  took  thegreatest  care  of,  and  the  keenest  interest  in,  each  one  of  her  guests,impressed  upon  us  thatthe  whole  affair  was  a  picnic  for  the  success  ofwhich  we  shared  the  responsibility.  At  all  events,  whatever  was  thecause,  the  spirit  of  youth  and  spontaneity  took  possession,  thoughthere  was  no  dearth  of  grey  hairs  and  most  of  us  had  seen  our  bestcricketing  days."I  would  like  to  say,"  Mr.  Studd  concluded,  "how  much  I  wasstruck  by  the  modesty,  the  courtesy,  and  the  good  heart  of  our  host—how  he  was  always  interested  in  the  opinions  and  views  of  eventhe  youngest  and  most  undeveloped.  He  had  the  true  feeling  of  anartist  for  his  'confreres,'  treating  each  with  the  respect  due  to  an  in-dependent worker  in  a  vast  field  of  research."The  Hon.  Walter  James,  who  became  one  of  Abbey's  closestfriends,  writes  thus:  "It  was  always  amatterfor  astonishment  howthe  Abbeys  could  suddenly  deal  with  an  incursion  of  some  ten  menand  make  them  all  perfectly  comfortable  and  radiantly  happy.  Itwas  the  great  occasion  of  the  year  for  a  good  many  of  us ,  I  know,  butI  am  not  sure  that  the  Abbeys  themselves  didn't  look  forward  to  itas  much  as  any  of  us,  and  I  know  that  they  were  very  sorry  when  the3 2 8WALTER  JAMESstress  of  Abbey 's  work  made  it  necessary  to  discontinue  the  festival.There  will  certainly  never  be  any  thing  quite  like  it  again  .Abbey  wasreally  and  genuinely  fond  of  cricket  and  thought  quite  a  lot  about  itat  seasons  when  many  enthusiastic  cricketers  have  quite  put  it  outof  their  minds.  I  have  been  out  with  him  on  his  cricket  ground  inFebruary  or  March,  throwing  cricket  balls  about  in  the  mud;  andthe  way  in  which  a  cricket  ball  can  sting  in  summer  is  a  mere  nothingto  what  it  can  do  when  it  is  wet  and  slimy  in  the  winter!  Howeverhard  Abbey  was  working  (and  he  was  always  working  very  hard  inthe  later  days  at  Fairford),  there  were  always  in  the  studio,  in  a  moreor  less  prominent  position,  a  cricket  bag  and  some  of  the  implementsof  the  game,  and  also  some  baseball  tackle."It  is  very  difficult  to  give  an  accurate  impression  of  the  quite  dis-tinctive atmosphere  which  always  surrounded  these  occasions,  butwhich  was  entirely  due  to  the  personality  of  our  host  and  hostess .  Af-ter dinner  in  the  evenings  weused  to  be  very  festive,  and  act  charades,sing  improvised  oratorios,  and  so  on.  Mrs.  Abbey  was  the  only  ladyexcept  on  one  or  two  occasions;  the  only  privileged  persons  of  theother  sex  were ,  I  think ,  my  wife  and  Lord  St .  Aldwy  n  's  daughters . ' 'To  these  memories  I  append  sentences  taken  here  and  there  fromletters  written  by  the  cricketers  either  to  th  eir  captain  or  to  their  hos-tess. ThusMr.Dermod  O'Brien,  who  had  strained  his  leg  duringone  of  the  games :  "Just  now  I  am  waiting  for  the  doctor  to  come  andput  my  leg  in  a  splint  and  plaster  so  that  I  snatch  the  occasion  towrite .  Should  I  have  to  have  my  leg  taken  off  at  the  knee ,  eventually,I  dedicate  it  to  Fairford  and  think  that  the  price  would  not  be  toogreat  for  what  I  have  had  at  your  and  your  husband's  hands."From  Arthur  Studd  to  Mrs.  Abbey  after  the  1901  week:  "It  washardly  possible  tobelievesomuchkindnessandgoodfellowship  ex-isted in  the  world  before  we  met  with  it  under  your  hospitable  roof,and  we  each  of  us  came  away  with  a  great  pleasure  added  to  our  livesand  a  new  revelation  of  artistic  possibilities  (which  the  losing  ofseveral  matches  only  emphasises)."From  Mr.  L.C.  Nightingale  ("The  Bird"),  of  Dulwich  College:"These  cricket  weeks  which  I  have  spent  at  your  house  have  given329WALTER  OSBORNEme  such  pleasure  that  they  form  landmarks  in  my  life — always  to  berecalled  with  delight."In  1 900  the  late  Walter  Osborne  who,  according  to  the  Dictionaryof  National  Biography ,  bowled  well  enough  to  have  made  a  living  bycricket,  had  he  wished,  once  performed  the  hat  trick,  and  duly  re-ceiving his  hat  (one  of  the  studio  properties)  thus  acknowledged  it:"The  hat  you  presented  me  with  excites  wonder  and  admiration,and  with  a  ticket  in  the  band  of  it,  bearing  the  words '  Hat  trick,  Fair-ford,  July ,  1 900, 'is  a  real  adornment  to  my  studio."  In  another  let-ter, also  to  Mrs.  Abbey ,  Osborne  said :  "Give  my  love  to  Mr.  Abbeyand  tell  him  I  shall  bringthose  unfailing  streaksof  thirst  and  hunger.I  wish  the  cricket  streak  were  half  as  reliable.  Whilst  I  write  it  pourswith  rain.  Sofarwe  have  been  denied  anyreal  summer  here,  and,in  the  words  of  Corot,  'Nature  is  hopelessly  green,  and  very  badlylighted.'  "  Again,  from  the  same  artist,  referring  to  a  match  with  SirJames  Barrie's  Eleven :"Begorrah!  I 'm  keen  to  help  you  in  the  de-struction of  the  'Leetle  Meenister'  and  his  team,  and  I  hope  to  bethere,  wherever  it  is,  on  May  igth.  I  fear  the  breakback  is  in  abey-ance, as  I  haven't  touched  a  bat  or  ball  since  last  May."Sir  James  Barrie,  a  cricket  enthusiast  not  less  keen  than  Abbey,and  the  ruling  spirit  of  a  club  of  his  own  called  the"Allahhakbaris"(meaning  "God  help  them!")  which  had  regular  contests  with  theArtists,  writes  to  me  thus:  "  Surely  you  are  to  have  a  chapter  aboutAbbey  as  a  cricketer?  No  one  not  native  born  to  it  was  ever  quite  soenamoured  of  the  game.  It  is  sad  that  we  have  no  painting  by  him  ofa  village  green  on  a  sunny  afternoon,  the  prettiest  sight  in  England.You  could  head  the  chapter  'He  falls  in  love.'"In  autumn  and  winter  Abbey  painted, but  in  spring  he  oiled  hisbat  and  in  May  he  put  on  his  pads.  Then  the  fun  began.  Hewas  tre-mendously professional  and  looked  with  remote  reproof  at  you  ifyou  did  not  call  the  ball  the  sphere  or  the  leather.  Tossing  for  firstinnings  was  a  solemn  ecstasy  to  him.  As  the  rival  captain,  it  was  myprivilege  to  walk  with  him  to  the  pitch  and  examine  the  state  ofthe  wicket.  We  shook  our  heads  over  it,  or  nodded,  or  said  it  was  abowler's  day  and  that  Jenkins  would  find  a  spot  presently;  and  you3 3 0J.  M.  BARRIEwould  have  sworn  that  Abb  ey  knew  what  we  were  talking  ab  out .  H  ewould  have  given  you  his  all  if  you  had  called  him  Jessop ."He  was  not  a  great  bat;  he  cannot  have  been  a  great  bat,  for  itseems  to  me  that  I  have  bowled  him.  Of  this,  however,  I  am  uncer-tain, as  a  few  weeks  after  one  of  our  encounters  each  was  of  theopinion  that  he  had  bowled  the  other.  I  think  the  reason  we  wereallowed  to  bowl  at  all  was  that  we  were  the  captains  and  no  one  couldtake  us  off.  Our  styles  were  dissimilar.  I  bowled  so  slowly  that  Ab-bey, having  gone  through  the  craziest  evolutions  with  the  bat  (seediagrams  6, 7, 8,  and  9)  grew  tired  of  waiting  and  lashed  out  whilethe  sphere  was  still  but  halfway  upon  its  travels.  In  this  way  I  thinkI  sometimes  got  him,  the  sphere  finally  resting  wearily  against  thewickets.  His  bowling  was  of  a  very  different  character.  He  camerushing  like  a  whirlwind  to  the  crease,  combining  in  one  gloriousmoment  all  the  methods  of  all  the  favourites  whom  he  studied  intext-books,  and  it  might  be  that  my  stumps  were  hurled  into  theslips .  But  he  had  his  off-days ,  like  Hirst  and  B arnes ,  and  the  others ,and  it  was  always  possible  that,  instead  of  mowing  down  the  sticks,he  would  hit  point  in  the  stomach.  The  short  field  was  always  veryalert  when  Abbey  went  on  to  bowl."It  was  in  fielding  that  he  was  truly  great ;  he  had  vast  courage  aswell  as  enthusiasm,  and  would  have  tried  to  stop  a  thunderbolt  tosave  the  third  run.  Abbey  in  the  field!  It  is  long  ago  now,  but  I  seemyself  still  about  to  receive  my  first  ball  of  the  seasonf rom  his  elevenof  Artists  (Nightingale,  Studdjames,  Ford,  Arnesby  Brown,  on  mylast  legs  I  salute  you!)  All  the  eleven  except  one  want  me  to  make  asingle  before  I  returntothepavilion,butthatone,initialsE.A.A.,has  for  his  passion  the  rigour  of  the  game .  He  would  rather  give  mea  picture  than  a  second  ball.  He  is  also  fiendishly  avid  to  be  himselfthe  instrument  of  my  undoing,  though  he  is  not  bowling.  I  seem  toface  the  bowler  calmly  (O  Swinstead,  O  Mores!)  like  one  who  feelsthat  as  the  years  roll  on  the  coming  mishaps  will  assume  a  smallerplace  on  the  horizon;  but  it  is  of  Abbey  I  am  thinking  and  with  trepi-dation. He  is  standing  at  mid-off — not  really  standing,  for  he  is  sofond  of  cricket  that  in  the  field  he  makes  himself  as  like  the  ball  asJ.  M.  BARRIEpossible.  His  muscles  are  wriggling  like  eels,  he  is  so  horribly  alive.I  know  he  is  creeping  nearer  me,  licking  his  lips  as  he  comes.  He  isnot  a  ball,  he  is  a  human  catapult,  and,  though  the  proposed  targetis  the  wickets,  I  know  that  in  the  last  second  he  will  change  his  mindand  hurl  the  leather,  if  he  gets  hold  of  it,  at  my  inoffensive  person."The  only  fault  he  found  in  cricket  was  that  it  was  not  sufficientlydangerous.  He  tried  to  remedy  this.  As  soon  as  you  struck  the  ballyou  remembered  Abbey  and  flung  yourself  on  your  face."Great  were  the  evenings  that  followed,  though  you  might  be  insticking  plaster.  He  was  the  soul  and  life  of  them.  All  my  memoriesof  him  are  of  a  great-hearted,  lovable  man,  a  strong  nail  to  keep  anybrotherhood  together.  We  all  take  our  hats  off  to  him  as  an  artist;  hewas  what  Stevenson  would  have  called  'one  of  the  swells';  but  evennow  if  I  meet  his  shade  suddenly  at  a  street  corner,  it  is  the  cricketerI  think  of  first,  and  I  involuntarily  duck  my  head."To  return  to  Mr .  S  winstead  's  account ."  No  more  delightful  even-ing," he  says,  "could  be  imagined  than  the  Artists'  Cricket  Clubannual  dinner  in  London.  Abbey  always  looked  forward  to  thisgathering,  and  he  would  never  miss  it  if  he  could  help,  and  presidedon  almost  every  occasion.  As  a  chairman  hewas  unique.  His  charm-ing allusions  to  cricket  incidents  of  the  last  season,  and  to  the  artistspresent,  many  of  whom  he  knew  intimately,  made  these  eveningsmemorable,  and  the  time  always  passed  in  the  most  cheery  way.Abbey  endeared  himself  to  many ,  both  here  and  in  America,  but  bynone  was  he  more  beloved  than  by  those  whose  good  fortune  it  wasto  be  associated  with  him  in  the  Artists'  Cricket  Club."Concerning  one  of  these  dinners,  a  letter  from  Abbey  to  Mr.Swinsteadin  1902  defines  his  attitude  to  the  game  very  clearly:  "Itis  awfully  good  of  you  all  to  wish  to  make  the  next  dinner  a  compli-mentary one  to  me — but  I  hope  you  will  not  think  (as  I  am  sure  youwill  not)  that  I  am  unappreciative  of  the  honour  you  would  do  me  ifI  ask  you  to  abandon  the  notion.  I  am  no  cricketer,  and  it  amuses  meimmensely  to  play  that  I  am — and  to  be  young  with  you  all .  I  shouldfeel  that  the  end  of  it  all  had  come  if  I  were  to  be  put  on  a  pedestaland  made  much  of — when  I  only  wish  to  be  one  of  'the  lot.'  I  know3 3 2THE  ARTISTS'  CRICKET  CLUBI'm  not, but  I  don't  wish  the  fool's  paradise  I  at  present  inhabit  tobe  rudely  jostled.  We  should  have  a  cheery  evening  as  of  yore — don'tlet's  have  any  changes."The  constitution  of  the  Artists'  Cricket  Club,  which  was  notformally  established  until  April,  1899,  and  was  distinct  from  theFairford  Cricket- Week  Companionship,  was  as  follows:  E.  A.  Ab-bey, R.  A.,  President;  H.H.La  Thangue,  A.R.A.,  Vice-President;A.  Chevalier  Tayler,  Hon.  Treasurer;  G.Hillyard  Swinstead,Hon.Secretary;  the  committee  consisting  of  Harry  Bates,  A.R.A.,  Regi-nald Blomfield,Arnesby  Brown,  Henry  J.  Ford,  George  Gascoyne,Herb  ert  Marshall ,  and  Philip  Norman .  Once  the  idea  was  approvedAbbey  threw  himself  into  the  project  with  all  his  thoroughness  andzest,  and  set  about  designing  the  cap  and  blazer,  which  were  to  beof  red,  white,  and  black — red  signifying  colour  as  colour,  and  blackand  white  as  the  other  medium  for  artists,  Abbey  having  a  theorythat  the  works  of  the  great  masters  were  based  upon  a  scheme  in-volving that  trinity .  Mr.  Swinstead  seems  to  have  submitted  his  ownblazer  as  a  model,  for  I  find  Abbey  writing  to  him  on  August  i9th,1 898:  "The  coat  is  great — I'll  send  for  one  at  once.  .  .  Ifoundsomebiscuits  in  the  pocket  which  I  have  carefully  preserved  for  you.  Isupposed  at  first  they  were  some  rare  kind  you  were  sending;  butno,  we  have  some  of  that  kind.  I  think  diagonal  stripes  for  the  hatribbon  best."Monday. —  I  have  lain  awake  several  nights  thinking  over  this 'stripe  business.  On  the  whole,  don't  you  think  a  stripe  going  roundlooks  more  regular?  I  think  so.  We  don't  want  to  be 'bizarre'."That  autumn  Abbey  went  to  Rome ,  but  even  there  he  could  thinkabout  the  Club  and  the  next  season,  as  well  as  trifle  a  little  with  theAmerican  national  game.  Writing  to  Mr.  Swinstead  on  October29th, hesaid:  "As  to  the  meetings,  I  shallbebackearlyinDecember,and  shall  try  to  do  my  duty  in  that  state  of  life  to  which  it  has  pleasedthe  Artists'  Cricket  Club  to  call  me.  ...  I  played  in  one  match  forMiller —  a  painstaking  6  not  out —  a  combination  of  patient  andwatchful  defence  with,  at  times, brilliant  and  timely  hitting  all  roundthe  shop .  Miller  wants  to  get  his  card  ready  early — say  about  Christ-VOL.II.— F  333BASE-BALL  IN  ROMEmas.  I  thought  we'd  do  a  two-days  match  with  him  if  all  goes  well.The  one-day  matches  are  very  unsatisfactory."I  am  getting  in  a  little  base-ball  game  here  with  the  students  atone  of  the  Jesuit  Colleges — they  're  obliged  to  wear  cassocks .  Theyplay  well — too  well  for  me."Writing  again  to  Mr.  Swinstead  from  Rome  on  November  iyth,he  said:  "You  should  see  mehere  play  baseball  in  the  Borghese  Gar-dens— with  American  students,  priests  in  cassocks  and  art  students.I  look  real  well,  but  the  natives  think  we're  crazy.  A  young  chap  ina  cassock,  a  rubber  breast  protector,  and  a  wire  mask  is  a  great  sight.They're  not  allowed  to  take  their  cassocks  off."I  bring  this  chapter  to  an  end  by  stating  that  although  Abbey  diedas  long  ago  as  1 91 1  ,the  Artists'  Cricket  Club,  which  still  flourishes,has  had  no  other  President.  Nor  will  it  ever  have  another,  for  afterhis  death  the  members  met  and  decided  to  consecrate  that  positiontohim.  Ina  very  touching  letter  to  Mrs.  Abbey, fromMr. Ford, thisdecision  was  communicated.  I  quote  a  little  from  it.  The  date  isMarch  14111,1913:  "Words  do  so  little  good,  but  I  am  sure  that  yourkind  and  sympathetic  heart  may  possibly  find  some  little  degree  ofcomfort  in  hearing  from  each  of  us  how  much  we  loved  him,  and  wejoin  our  lesser  sorrowtoy  our  great  one  if  we  may.  And  we  shall  thinklovingly  always  of  that  great, kind  spirit  of  his  that  was  the  making  ofour  happiness.  How  he  loved  to  make  everyone  cheerful  and  happyand  comfortable  in  mind  and  body  around  him  !' '  I  feel  sure  you  will  b  e  interested  to  hear  a  little  about  the  meetingof  the  Artists'  Cricket  Club  last  night.  Though  Walter  [James]  toldme  that  he  hoped  to  see  you  and  tell  you  all  about  it,  still  I  should  liketo  write  a  line  myself.  Walter  presided  at  the  dinner  and  meetingafterwards.  He  made  a  very  beautiful  and  very  simple  speech  aboutdear  Abbey,  and  asked  us  to  drink  to  his  memory  standing  up  insilence.  When  this  was  done  Swinstead  spoke  at  some  length,  dwel-ling on  the  delightful  beginnings  of  the  Club  and  all  those  happytimes  at  Fairford  with  you  and  him.  He  pointed  out  very  well  andfeelingly  how  much  we  owed  to  Abbey ,  that  he  had  founded  the  cluband  was  the  moving  spirit  of  it,  and  how  we  had  all  felt  so  sadly  his334A  PERPETUAL  PRESIDENTloss  since  he  died,  and  that  it  seemed  impossible  to  replace  such  aman  as  he.  So  he  proposed  that  we  the  Artists  should  consider  himto  be  our  Perpetual  President,  and  as  such  his  name  should  be  in-scribed at  the  head  of  our  lists.  The  actual  words  of  Swinstead'smotion  were  as  follows  :  'In  order  to  honour  the  memory  of  EdwinAustin  Abbey,  R.  A.,  the  founder  of  the  club,  we  retain  his  nameasPerpetual  President. '  This  was  carried  unanimously ,  and  in  order  tohave  extra  working  officials  to  keep  the  club  going  strong ,  we  electedthree  additional  Vice-Presidents,  Swinstead,  Blomfield  and  WalterJames,  who  will  all  take  an  active  interest  in  the  prosperity  of  theClub."Ac*-    ftCCHAPTER  XXXIIIA  LONDON  HOME1898  (continued)-i  899  Aged  46-47Munich— Verona— Rome— The  AmericanAcademyin  Rome— Awardsfrom  Abroad—Costumes  for  Richard II. —John  M.

Munich,  however,  was  a  disappointment,  for  the  Bava-rian National  Museum ,  where  Abbey  had  hoped  to  study  the  Gothiccollections,  the  armour  and  the  weapons,  in  which  it  is  particularlyrich,  was  closed,  and  the  treasures  were  gradually  being  moved  to  anew  building.  In  the  hope  of  some  kind  of  preferential  treatment,Abbey  called  on  Lenbach,  whom  he  had  met  at  Leighton's,  andthrough  the  interpretative  services  of  another  caller  (who  chancedto  be  Siegfried  Wagner)  put  his  case,  with  the  result  that  he  wasallowed  the  run  of  the  partly  denuded  galleries,  where  fortunatelythe  armour  and  weapons  still  remained  intact,  and  he  made  a  num-ber of  useful  sketches.  It  was  not,  however,  until  1906  that  he  wasable  again  to  study  the  collections  as  a  whole.From  Munich  they  passed  on  to  Verona,  where  Abbey  madestudies  of  the  military  Ponte  Molle — the  Ponte  del  Castel  Vecchio— both  eastern  and  western  sides,  engaging  a  room  with  a  little  bal-cony opposite  the  western  side  in  order  to  be  undisturbed  by  in-quisitive foot-passengers,  while  the  eastern  side  was  done  from  thecourtyard  of  a  neighbouring  palace.  He  also  made  studies  in  theGiusti  Gardens,  some  of  which  were  of  use  when  he  repainted  hispicture  "A  Poet"  on  his  return  to  England.Arrived  in  Rome  they  took  rooms  under  Elihu  Vedder  at  No.  68via  di  Capo  le  Casa,  and  began  to  frequent  the  Villa  Papa  Giulio  forarchitectural  studies.3 3 6AN  ITALIAN  JOURNEYAbbey  also  visited  the  scholarship  students  at  the  American  Aca-demy and  gave  them  hints  in  arranging  compositions.  So  much  forwork.  As  to  play,  extracts  already  quoted  from  letters  to  Mr.  Swin-stead  (in  the  previous  chapter)  have  shown  us  Abbey  at  baseball  withthe  American  priests  in  the  Borghese  Gardens .  There  were  also  ex-cursions to  the  environs — to  Frascati  and  to  Tivoli,  where  in  theVilla  d'Este  he  found  the  staircase  which  he  used  in  Mr.  Taylor'spicture  "A  Measure."The  death  of  Mrs.  Abbey 's  father,  which  had  just  occurred  at  aripe  age,  is  referred  to  in  the  following  letter  from  Abbey  to  hisbrother-in-law,  Mr.  Frederick  Mead,  from  Rome,  on  November1 6th : '  T  rememb  er  with  great  pleasure  your  father 's  kindly  interestin  my  workand  in  my  affairs  generally ,  and  I  wish  he  could  have  livedto  pay  us  a  visit  at  Fairford.  Your  loss  has  been  great ,  but  your  fatherand  mother  were  spared  toyou  for  longer  than  is  the  lot  of  most  men;but  it  is  a  loss  that  makes  us  feel  older,  as  I  can  say  from  experience.Give  my  love  to  your  wife  and  tell  her  she  has  married  a  pretty  goodchap,  who  if  he  only  makes  as  good  a  husband  as  he  does  a  brother-in-law  will  leave  little  to  be  desired . ' '  Referring  to  his  hope  that  Mr.Mead  would  bring  his  wife  to  visit  them  and  perhaps  sojourn  for  awhile  in  Italy ,  Abbey  says:  "We  have  several  times  seen  places  thatwill  be  available  for  a  few  months —  villas  and  palaces,  with  fleascomplete — but  for  a  real  rest  England  is  the  spot.  We  have  just  re-turned from  a  few  days  at  Tivoli,  where  we  slept  in  a  brick-pavedapartment  last  scrubbed  in  the  time  of  the  Caesars —  incomplete  inall  respects  from  the  point  of  view  of  modern  requirements  save  thatthey  supplied  us  with  awhite  comb  (which  had  an  elephant  engravedupon  it).  This  we  looked  at  with  respect,  but  neglected  to  avail  our-selves of."After  leaving  Rome  a  few  days  were  spent  in  Perugia,  where  theAbbeys  had  the  delightful  rooms  in  the  GrandHotel  occupied  everyyear  by  Leighton,  when  he  went  there  to  write  his  annual  address.On  December  loth  Abbey  wrote  from  there  to  Mr.  Spielmann:"This  is  a  tremendously  suggestive  place,  but  I  am,  so  to  speak,merely  breathing  the  air  and  thinking  over  what  might  happen  if  I337THE  AMERICAN  SCHOOL  IN  ROMEhadn't  so  many  other  irons  in  the  fire  at  the  moment.

Itdoesme  good  to  hear  the  servants  speak  of  him.  .  .  .You  should  be  veryinterested  in  the  American  School  at  Rome .  It  is  a  lively  and  a  likelykid,  and  has  now  five  architects,  one  painter  and  one  sculptor  underits  wing,  with  rather  uncomfortable  though  swell  quarters  in  theVilla  Aurora.  They  work  on  the  lines  of  the  Villa  Medici,  but,  ofcourse,  have  not  the  background  of  that  splendid  establishment.When  shall  we  have  a  similar  one  to  send  our  medallists  of  the  R.A.to  ?  "•  -The  last  sentence  shows  that  all  thosey  ears  ago  Abbey  alreadyhad  in  mind  a  British  School  in  Rome.  Of  this  school,  which  now  isbeginning  to  flourish,  and  the  association  of  Abbey  with  it,  morewill  be  said  later.  Abbey  maintained  his  interest  in  the  AmericanAcademy  to  the  end.In  the  work  of  this  year(i898)the"HolyGrail"panels,  of  course,came  first.  Having  finished  the  "King  Lear"  Abbey  began  "TheTrial  of  Queen  Katharine"  and  continued  upon  Mr.  Taylor's  com-mission. On  being  exhibited  at  the  Vienna  Jubilee  Exposition  the"Hamlet"  won  for  its  painter  the  large  gold  medal;  and  the  GoldMedal  of  Honour  from  the  Pennsylvania  Academy  came  this  yearalso.  Mr.  Edward  Homer  Coates,  the  President  of  the  Academy,announcing  this ,  wrote : '  'Permit  me  to  offer  our  sincere  congratula-tions upon  an  award  to  one  whose  career  has  done  so  much  honourtotheAcademy  Schools,  to  Philadelphia  and  to  the  whole  Country."Another  American  compliment  was  the  formation  in  Rochester,N.Y.,ofthe"EdwinAustinAbbey  Club  of  Painting  and  Design,"the  members  of  which  were  chiefly  lawyers  with  leanings  to  art.Another  of  Abbey 's  tasks  in  1 898  was  to  design,  at  the  request  ofIrving,  the  dresses  and  scenes  for  Richard  II.  which  he  proposed  torevive  at  the  Lyceum .  H ere  Abb ey  was  in  his  element ,  and  he  flunghimself  into  the  work  with  tremendous  spirit.  His  thoroughnesswas  never  better  exemplified,  for  he  designed  dresses  for  everyonewho  could  possibly  be  on  the  stage,  from  king  to  cobbler.  WritingtoJohn  Hay  after  the  actor  had  perforce  given  up  the  scheme,  he  says:3 3 8COSTUMES  FOR  RICHARD  II"I  have  been  disappointed  very  much  recently  by  poor  Irving's  de-cision to  abandon  his  idea  of  doing  Richard II.  I  had  been  having  lotsof  fun  with  it,  and  had  had  his  scene-painters  down  here  in  relays,who  had  undertaken  to  reproduce  certain  gardens  as  depicted  inthat  beautiful  MS .  of  the  Romance  of  the  Rose  in  the  British  Museumand  to  construct  a  highly  mediaeval  and  heraldic  background  for  theunfortunate  gentleman.  It  was  all  to  be  absolutely  unreal  and  a  long,longtime  ago.  I  had  lots  of  old  patterns  with  queer  birds  andbeasts'  aff ronte , '  and  the  heraldic  device  of  each  character  was  to  b e  wovenand  embroidered.  Ships  built  that  never  could  have  sailed  on  anysea,  and  so  on  and  so  on — and  it  is  too  bad  that  it  isn't  to  come  off.  Iam  wondering  what  he  will  do  with  all  the  stuff — for  lots  of  it  wasfinished . ' '  The  whole  collection  of  these  drawings ,  with  pieces  of  theactual  stuffs  pinned  to  them  and  every  kind  of  careful  instruction  asto  the  lacing  of  shoes  and  so  forth ,  is  now  in  Mrs  .Abbey 's  possession.Some  of  the  dresses  are  magnificent;  all  are  striking;  and  the  totaleffect,  done  in  Irving's  handsome,  lavish  way ,  would  have  been  un-forgettable.Meanwhile  Tadema  was  also  putting  his  pencil  and  knowledge  atthe  disposal  of  the  stage,  having  accepted  Beerbohm  Tree's  invita-tion to  dress  Julius  desar.  Writing  on  December  ist  he  confessesto  a  weariness  similar  to  that  which  Abbey  had  felt  while  La  Toscawas  preparing:  "Unfortunately  we  will  be  unable  to  profit  by  yourkindness,  for  the  rehearsals  of  Julius  Ccesar  have  begun  and  will  lasttill  the22nd,  and  the  23rd  or  24th  we  will  be  off  to  sweeter  climes —I  wish  Julius  Cassar  had  never  been  born.  What  a  relief  it  would  havebeen  to  me ! "  I  n  another  letter  written  about  this  time  I  find  Tademaexpressing  himself  thus  sweepingly  with  regard  to  the  art  of  musicand  those  who  practise  it:  "Bispham  was  here  also  and  joined  in  thefun.  He  is  a  fine  singer  and  first-class  musician.  Youknowhim?  Ilike  him;  he  lives  only  for  his  art,  bless  him!  I  hate  people  who  dosomething  else."In  December  the  Century  Magazine  again  became  desirous  thatAbbey  'sworkshould  appear  inits  pages,  and  its  editor,  R.W.  Gilder,writes  asking  him  to  contribute  "some  pictorial  illustrations  of339J.M.SWANCromwell — scenes  in  his  life  to  be  selected  by  you,"  but  other  workengrossed  him  to  the  exclusion  of  this  and  many  other  things  hewould  have  liked  to  do.The  last  letter  of  1 898  is  from  the  animal  painter  John  M.  Swan."Old  Ford  [Onslow],"the  letter  says, "ran  in  yesterday.  We  werespeaking  of  you ,  but  I  still  dispute  your  being  the  most  hard -workedman  in  England:The  prettiest  sight  that  e'er  was  seenWas  Lincoln  men  in  Morgan  Green .I  have  done  no  work  except  retouching  waxes  and  the  small  canvasof  apuma,  or  the  'Mounting  Lion':  mine  is  goingup  a  tree.  May  youcontinue  to  crackle  all  over  with  bank-notes    "The  year  1 899  opens  for  us  with  a  letter  from  Abbey  to  John  Hayon  January  ist,  written  rather  more  to  Hay  the  Secretary  of  Statethan  to  Hay  the  convive.  For  Abbey  had  a  grievance — the  heavy  dutyon  imported  works  of  art  in  America,  especially  those  of  living  men,and  he  wanted  it  redressed.  "What  am  I, "he  asks, "that  I  shouldraise  my  little  peep?"  And  he  replies,  "Oneof  a  small  class  of  ex-patriated American  citizens  who  is  taxed  by  his  grateful  country  forsending  his 'things' home,  instead  of  disposing  of  them  here.  I  havesometimes  wondered  how  it  can  be  legal  to  discriminate  againstartists  in  this  way.  The  members  of  other  learned  professions  arelet  off — and  I  wonder  whether  the  amount  we  are  taxed,  howevertroublesome  and  vexatious  it  is  to  us,  really  benefits  those  men  verygreatly  who  prompted  Congress  to  impose  a  duty  upon  our  work.If  ever  there  was  a  learned  profession  ours  is  one,  and  one  it  takesa  long  time  to  learn,  too — I  doubt  if  anyone  ever  got  it  'good  andlearned'  —  and,  as  a  rule,  the  reason  we  stay  here  is  because  weare  students,  and  not,  as  I  have  heard,  because  it  is  cheap  (which  Ihave  yet  to  discover).  In  the  instructions  to  the  Consul  in  Rome,the  U.S.  Treasurer  spoke  of  us  as  having  our  'places  of  business'abroad.  I  wonder  if  he  knew  what  he  meant  by  that.  I  suppose  hewould  call  the  Vatican,  or  the  South  Kensington  Museum,  a  'placeof  business.'3 4 0CHELSEA  LODGE"Most  of  us  are  proud  to  b  e  Americans .  I  am  ..  .  and  in  spite  of  allthe  exasperating  snubs  we  are  made  to  suffer  from  ignorant  officialsthere  are  mighty  few  of  us,  lamgladtosay —  and  you  know — whowould  exchange  his  birthright  for  any  number  of  official  distinc-tions, no  matter  how  much  easier  things  would  thereby  be  made  forthose  of  us  who  live  here;  and  I  do  not  think  we  should  be  fined  forthis  sentiment,  as  though  we  were  a  disgrace  to  our  country,  either.As  you  know,  many  things  would  be  made  easier  for  us,  as  students— or  even  members  of  society — if  we  were  subjects  of  foreign  sove-reigns. All  sort  of  privileges,  for  instance,  are  accorded  thepension-naires  of  the  foreign  academies  at  Rome  which  our  boys  of  the  Ame-rican School  find  very  difficult  of  attainment— and  simply  becausethey  have  no  official  position    I'm  afraid  that  most  of  the  know-ledge of  art  students  at  the  disposal  of  many  of  our  Consuls  and  evenMinisters  is  gathered  from  a  perusal  of  Trilby.'''  Later,  as  we  shallsee,  Abbey  returned  to  this  crusade.Hitherto ,  the  Abb  ey s  on  their  visits  to  London  had  stayed  usuallyin  lodgings,  while  Abbey  had  now  and  then  borrowed  a  studio  for  afew  days;  but  now  deciding  that  a  real  London  residence  with  astudio  would  be  advisable  they  took  a  three-years  lease  of  ChelseaLodge  in  Tite  Street .  As  with  Morgan  Hall ,  so  with  Chelsea  Lodge ,the  house  became  a  lasting  home.  Morgan  Hall  was  given  up  only  atChristmas  in  191 1 ,  while  after  the  three-years  lease  expired  Abbeybought  Chelsea  Lodge,  and  it  was  there  that  he  died.  Itisapleasanthouse,  at  the  corner  of  Dilke  Street,  close  to  the  river,  but  not  onit,  with  two  large  studios  and  a  shady,  partly-paved  garden  withinwhitewashed  walls.  This  garden  is  overlooked  by  a  spacious,  oak-panelled  dining-room,  the  chimney  overmantel  of  which,  dated1650,  came  from  an  old  oak  room  in  Essex  which  Abbey  boughtmany  years  before  and  set  up  in  the  room  underneath  his  studio  inBedford  Gardens.We  find  him  in  a  sportive  mood  in  January.  His  young  friendsRuth  Daniel,  one  of  the  daughters  of  the  late  Provost  of  WorcesterCollege,andAlfredParsons'sniece,PhyllisParsons(nowMrs.HughGosset)  had  started  a  small  amateur  quarterly,  entitled  the  Scarlet3 4 1If    e'er    I     Shou.(<>  "TVcxveffee  O.c<"-/s0c.  -    i    ''..   yj  t  c  J     <?  nl  i  r«  /  y      07     GJ  <5  SMoi-nvnr    Cvi-^c)     NicAtr"flihtJ    t>Ke^C,^/^V?.,)£Jf  /  ^<'f&.yi<^s•'/  A '     V .  \  ^,K  rt^r^.4  j  U  ^ )  //*  -^  P~^i  ^  -*V    %^*  -1   v  it—j*1  -'  nf.fc-'^g-'  iW^ft1*'1'  ^^0'<rTht       f  at  )     Ci    ^)     r^ip     K    ^Were     C.H     *C(*vc9    "»»o     b^trWhfnfvfr       fh*'<>     W/>«     of      iKf  f  f      5"io/f)    M.Ik;,,,     fft-.l'Wklckvvn?    a"   3/J    La!7)y     o/     PoJsA  CHILDREN'S  MAGAZINE, andacopy  of  thefirstnumber — for  January,  1899 — was  sentto  Fairford  by  Miss  Parsons.  Abbey  replied:  "I  enclose  the  'mun'for  the  'mag' — and  I  send  you  a  little  thing  of  my  own — absolutelyoriginal  and  perfectly  fresh  and  new.  I  don't  dare  hope  that  it  willfind  a  place  in  the  Scarlet  Runner, but  with  all  its  faults  it  came  fromthe  heart.  I  was  much  interested  in  the  publication,  and  read  itnearly  all.  I  never  knew  before  about  Bods,  and  it  reminded  me  ofseveral  things  that  might  have  happened  there,  which  I  have  em-balmed in  appropriate  verse — which  is  at  your  disposal  should  youcare  to  have  it.  Mrs.  A.  likes  it  very  much  indeed.  There  are  picturesto  the  poetry.  All  high-class  pictures — some  quite  crowded  onesand  some  with  only  one  or  two  figures  in  them.  But  you  mustn'tthink  I  didn  't  take  pains  with  them  on  that  account .Miss  Parsons,  of  course,  requested  that  the  Bods  series  might  be. "..sent,  and  a  few  days  later  Abbey  despatched  them  with  this  letter:"Morgan  Hall,"Fairford,  Gloucestershire."Mv  DEAR  PHYLLIS,  "January  25th,  1899.'

ABBEY."Four  drawings  are  reproduced  here.  As  is  so  often  the  case  withamateur  periodicals,  the  fourth  number  was  the  last.In  March  the  Abbeys  moved  into  Chelsea  Lodge,  although  it  wasfar  from  ready  for  them.  (Writing  to  Mr.  Spielmann,  on  the  nth,Abbey  says: ' '  The  stairways  are  full  of  men  carrying  things  different343A  LONDON  HOMEways —  ladders  mostly"),  but  in  spite  of  inconveniences  he  wasable  to  paint,  his  immediate  work  being  the  completion  of  "Who  isSilvia?"  and  "O  Mistress  Mine,  where  are  you  roaming?"  for  theAcademy ;  the  completion  of  "A  Poet"  (repainted)  for  Mr .  Taylor  inNew  York;  and  thebeginning  of  "ThePenanceof  Eleanor, Duchessof  Gloucester."  "Sincel  came  back  from  Italy, "he  tells  Mr.  Spiel-mann,"I  have  repainted  entirely  'A  Poet,' which  was  in  last  year'sNew  Gallery —  In  fact  it  was  largely  on  account  of  its  shortcomingsthat  I  went  down  there.  It  is  vastly  improved,  and  its  companion'The  Dance'  [afterwards  entitled  'A  Measure']  is  well  on  its  way."He  was  also  this  spring  busy  with  Mr.  Swinstead  on  the  formal  es-tablishment of  the  Artists'  Cricket  Club.  In  the  last  letter  fromFairford  he  says:  "Alas !  the  big  beech  blew  down  in  the  storm—which  makes  that  shady  corner  where  Blomfield  dropped  so  manycatches  sunny  and  uncomfortable."At  the  cricket  week  at  Morgan  Hall  in  July  four  matches  wereplayed.  The  first,  against  an  Eleven  of  Oxford  graduates,  was  wonby  the  Artists:  H.  J.Ford  72,  Walter  Osborne  51,  A.H.Studd  31,G.Gascoyne23-  "E.  A.  Abbey,  not  out,  2."  The  second  match  theylost — against  Mr.  F.  Henderson's  Eleven.  The  third  they  won  veryhandsomely,  G.  H.  Swinstead  making  a  terrific  139,  with  five  sixesinit,  Arnesby  Brown  34,  and  H.  J.Ford  30.  "E.  A.  Abbey, stumpedJ.H.  Simmons,  bowled  E.  W.Treeborn,  6."  The  last  match  wasagainst  the  Wiltshire  Wanderers ,  and  the  Artists  were  badly  beaten ,only  G.H.  Swinstead  (3  2)  making  double  figures.  "E.  A.  Abbey,  notout,o."  A  letter  from  Abbey  to  his  brother  in  August  gives  somedetails  of  the  week,  which  is  described  as  a  great  pleasure  and  veryinvigorating:  "A  cheery  houseful  of  chaps — some  of  whom  werereally  good  musicians.  We  had  the  whole  lot  in  the  house  this  time—and  it  was  pretty  full.  James  composed  an  oratorio  every  eveningupon  the  events  of  the  day,  and  was  really  funny.  We  had  a  lot  ofcripples .  Studd  kept  wicket  and  batted  two  days  with  a  badly  sprain-ed ankle.  Gascoyne  cracked  a  tendon  in  his  leg.  Blomfield  knockedhis  thumb  out  of  joint  and  had  to  leave  for  home .  And  despite  all  wewere  cheerful.344ACADEMIC  DUTIES"I've  got  a  lot  of  work  on  hand — have  finally  got  the  commissionforthereredosfor  the  American  Church  in  Paris  and  expect  to  getat  it  this  autumn.

I  am  too  much  wedded  tothe  quiet  of  the  country  now,  and  all  the  distractions  put  me  out.  Iam  expected,  of  course,  to  do  many  more  things  than  I  was  when  Ilived  in  London  before — to  serve  on  committees  and  attend  meet-ings and  to  be  steward  at  Benevolent  Society  dinners  (the  latter  wasa  fearsome  business — nearly  drove  me  mad.)  Then  one  has  to  be 'athome 'on  certain  days.  I  didn't  so  much  mind  this  latter.  I  saw  a  lotof  American  friends  I  should  otherwise  have  missed.  Mark  Twaincame  on  the  last  Sunday  with  his  family;  so  did  Arthur  Scribner  anda  lot  more.  I  saw  Dunne  several  times  ('Mr.  Dooley') — a  very  nicechap,  I  thought."When  the  Academy  closed  Abbey  repainted  the  linings  of  thesleeves  in  "O  Mistress  Mine"  and  scraped  out  the  head  of  "Silvia"altogether,  repainting  this  from  another  model.  "O  Mistress  Mine"was  bought  by  the  Walker  Art  Gallery  in  Liverpool,  and  "Who  isSilvia?"  by  Senator  Clark,  who  later  bought  also  "The  Trial  ofQueen  Katharine,"  which  Abbey  now  again  set  to  work  upon.  OnNovember  4th  a  dinner  was  given  by  his  friends  to  Alma  Tademain  honour  of  his  knighthood,  and  Abbey  designed  the  menu  card,Alfred  Parsons  carrying  out  its  floral  decoration.A  letter  to  Will  Abbey  later  inNovemberagaintells  the  news:"  I'mat  work  on  the  big  'Henry  VIII'  (this  is  the  'Trial  of  Katharine')which  I  thought  I  was  finishing  last  spring  (but  lo!

Abbey  had  made  a  number  of  studies  in  the  church  for  thispurpose;  but  ultimately  discarded  the  idea.  To  have  had  this  beauti-ful glass  in  one  of  the  paintings  of  Fairford's  illustrious  artist  wouldhavebeenpeculiarly  interesting.

Gothic  architecture  has  no  busi-ness in  the  Potomac  (I  suppose  this  was  meant  to  be  Gothic — incombination  with  iron  trusses).  There  is  no  problem  in  bridgingthe  Potomac  just  there  that  a  good  architect  could  not  cope  with,and  it  does  seem  to  me  that,  with  the  fine  classic  tradition  existingin  Washington,  something  like  the  Ponte  Molle  outside  Rome,  oreven  the  St.  Angelo  bridge,  would  be  far  finer,  more  elegant,  andmore  appropriate.  There  is  no  necessity  for  iron  girders  just  there—that  I  know  of.  The  accompanying  letterpress  intimated  that  thePresident  had  set  his  heart  upon  this  scheme,  which  is  certainly  fineand  fitting  in  every  way — but  do  urge  him  to  have  the  right  thing.That  fortified  German  towered  affair  is  surely  just  the  wrong  thing.There  are  some  inadequate  pictures  of  the  bridges  I  mention  in  theEncyclopedia  Britannica,  but  I  dare  say  the  President  knows  theoriginals.

One  passage  runs:  "I  am  afraid  I  shan'tbe  able  to  be  there — in  town — at  all  this  season.  When  I  say  'afraid'that  is  hypocrisy — in  respect  to  everyone  but  you  and  your  glorioushusband.  I  lament  my  farness  from  you,  but  I  have  partial  peacehere.

Abbey  wrote: ' '  I  hadthought ,  too , that  it  would  be  an  educational  thing  tobe  about  amongthose  things  in  the  Museum  all  day.

I  n  1 900 ,  however,  he  was  madethe  subject  of  "a  laudatory"  article  by  Mr. Henry  Strachey,  illus-trated by  reproductions  of  his  work,  including  a  drawing  for  an  OldSong  that  had  not  before  been  reproduced.The  critical  years  in  Abbey's  life  have  been  1871,  when  he  joinedHarpers ' ;  1 878 ,  when  he  discovered  England ,  and  not  only  Englandbut  Old  England;  1888, when  he  began  to  illustrate  Shakespeare;1889,  which  led  to  his  engagement;  and  1890,  when  he  was  marriedand  received  the  Boston  commission.  The  year  we  are  now  entering(1901)  was  critical,  too;foritwas  then  that  the 'Holy  Grail' paintingswere  finished  and  Abbey  was  at  last  free  from  a  task  the  magnitudeof  which,  although  it  did  not  dismay  him,  had  been  a  source  of  someconcern  for  his  friends.  It  was  then,  too,  that,  with  characteristiccourage  and  versatility,  he  accepted  a  new  commission  from  Har-pers' to  illustrate  the  Tragedies  of  Shakespeare.By  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  dated  August  yth,  1901 ,  the  artistwas  tomakeseventy  drawings  for  Shakespeare's  plays  other  than  theComedies,  and  thirty  for  Goldsmith's  Deserted  Village.  The  origi-nals of  both  sets  of  these  drawings  were  to  belong  to  the  artist,  andthe  copyright,  with  certain  reservations,  was  to  belong  to  the  pub-lishers; the  drawings  were  to  be  supplied  at  regular  intervals  within354ELECTION  TO  ATHEN^UMsix  years,  and  the  payment  was  to  be  50,000  dollars.  The  serial  andbook  rights  in  the  Goldsmith  drawings  were  to  be  paid  for  at  the  rateof  300  dollars  a  drawing.Let  us,  however,  take  the  year  1901  in  due  course.  In  the  earlymonths  a  loan  exhibition  of  the  work  of  modern  illustrators  was  heldat  South  Kensington,  at  which  Abbey  was  represented  by  twenty-two  drawings  from  She  Stoops  to  Conquer,  Old  Songs  and  The  QuietLife.The  first  document  is  a  letter  from  the  secretary  of  the  Athenaeumon  February  8th ,  informing  the  artist  that  he  had  been  elected  to  theclub  under  Rule  II.,  an  honour  which  drew  from  Henry  James  thefolio  wing  letter:' '  The  Athenaeum ,"MY  DEAR  ABBEY,  "February  nth,  1901.' '  I  can 't  help  making  you  a  sign  of  high  pleasure  over  your  electionhere,  in  such  a  pleasant  and  distinguishing  (if  anything  could  add  toyour  distinction)  way.  The  only  flaw  in  the  thing  is  that  they  didn'telect  Mrs  .Abbey  too — though  I  am  sure  it  gives  her  exactly  as  muchpleasure  as  if  they  had.  And  also,  possibly,  a  little,  that  between  thebride  of  art  and  the  bride  of  life  (Mormon  that  you  are !)  you  '11  nevercome  here  at  all.  I  think  of  that  ruefully;  for  I — a  strict  monogamist—am  wintering  now  (till  Easter)  in  town,  and  it  doesn't  seem  theopportunity  for  seeing  you  that  it  ought  ideally  to  be.  However  I  Vegot  a  little  perch  now  that  makes  London  more  easy  to  me,  and  itmay  represent  more  possibilities  and  coincidences.  I  cultivate  newsof  you  whenever  I  can — notably  from  Jon.  Sturges.  Please  give  myheartiest  greeting  to  your  wife,  and  believe  me  more  than  ever  bothyoursandhers,  "HENRY  JAMES."The  first  of  Abbey's  own  letters  in  1901  is  dated  February  iyth,just  after  Queen  Victoria's  death,  written  to  his  friend  ThomasShields  Clarke,  the  artist,  who  had  lent  him  his  New  York  studioin  1 897 .' '  We  go  up  to  town  about  the  middle  of  next  month  and  onApril  i  st  I  begin  my  month's  penal  servitude  at  the  R.A.,  selectingand  hanging.  As  there  were  14,000  sent  in  last  year,  and  the  number355QUEEN  VICTORIA'S  FUNERALof  pictures  increases  at  the  rate  of  about  400  a  year,  I  suppose  weshall  gaze  on  that  many  more  this  year.  What  in  the  world  becomesof  'em  all  ?  It  is  as  well  we  don't  have  to  serve  for  more  than  two  yearsat  a  time.  I  suppose  it  will  be  pretty  quiet  in  town.  It  is  certainly  ex-traordinary to  see  a  whole  nation  in  black.  I  saw  the  funeral,  and  amost  impressive  sight  it  was — more  impressive  than  anything,  thedead  silence  of  the  vast  crowd . ' 'Neither  when  he  saw  that  silent  crowd  nor  wrote  those  lines  hadAbbey  any  idea  as  to  what  bearing  the  death  of  the  Queen  was  to  haveupon  his  own  career.  Such  foreknowledge  is  denied  us.  But  only  alittle  later,  in  March,  he  undertook,  by  command  of  the  King,  topaint  for  him  the  official  picture  of  His  Majesty's  Coronation.  Noone  had  fewer  pretensions  to  be  a  Court  painter.  However  he  mayhaveshrunk  from  a  task  in  which  the  personal  freedom  that  he  valuedso  much  as  an  artist  seemed  certain  to  be  restricted,  it  was,  he  felt,impossible  to  refuse  when  he  considered  the  compliment  that  wasbeing  paid  not  alone  to  him  but  also  to  his  country.  As  has  been  saidelsewhere  in  this  book,  there  were  precedents  for  asking  Americanartists  to  paint  English  royal  scenes;  but  they  were  of  ancient  date.The  compliment  to  Abbey  and  America  was  a  marked  one,  especiallycoming  from  so  thoughtful  a  tactician  as  Edward  VII.,  and  couldnot  be  rejected.  Nor  could  the  painter  of  so  much  history  that  waspast  be  wholly  without  pleasure  at  the  thought  of  becoming  thepainter  of  history  in  the  making.*Punch,  by  the  hand,  probably,  of  the  late  Sir  Francis  Burnand,  had  something  to  sayabout  the  choice  of  the  painter:  "Most  appropriately,  the  Coronation  scene  in  the  Abbeyis  to  be  painted  by  the  Abbey  (R.A.).  Let  us  sing  to  the  tune  of 'Sally  in  our  Alley': —Of  all  the  painters  we  like  best,There's  none  like  Edwin  Abbey.To  Co-ro-nation  he,  full  dressed,Will  go,  and  nothing  shabby.He'll  look  so  neat,  and  smile  so  sweet,As  guileless  as  a  babby.Oh,  won't  the  picture  be  a  treatWhen  painted  by  our  Abbey  !Probably  some  French  correspondents,  who  are  always  '  in  the  know,'  will  record  thefact  that  the  task  of  representing  the  ceremony  on  canvas  was  entrusted  to  one  ofthe  clerge  du  Cathedral,  M.  1'Abbe  de  Westminster."3 5 6THE  "CRUSADERS"  PICTUREThe  letter  to  Mr.  Clarke  quoted  above  says  also  that  the  "Grail"painting,  the"Castleof  the  Maidens,  "has  just  goneoffto  the  Salon.Forthe  Academy  Abbey  was  finishing  his  "Crusaders  Sighting  Jer-usalem," an  upright  picture,  7  feet  by  3  feet  9  inches,  which  is  nowin  the  possession  of  Mrs.  Abbey.  This  picture,  which  is  at  once  oneof  the  simplest  and  most  imaginative  of  Abbey's  works,  has  a  re-markable radiance.  Story  there  is  none,  and  yet  nothing  elaboratecould  so  vividly  bring  to  mind  the  idea  of  the  Holy  Wars .  In  the  raptface  of  the  central  figure  we  see  the  spiritual  enthusiasm  with  whichso  many  youthful  volunteers  dashed  in  while  the  old  campaigner,who  kneels  beside  him  and  holds  his  sword  with  the  reverence  ofthe  Cross  which  it  symbolises,  typifies  the  tried  warrior  who  hasbeen  through  all  and  knows  all.Abbey's  first  cricket  match  in  1901  was  on  May  I4th,  against  anEleven  brought  together  by  Mr.  Walter  Frith.  The  Artists  won,Abbeymaking  2.  A  week  later  he  played  against  Sir  J.M.Barrie'sEleven  and  made  4 — not  a  great  score,  but  memorable  since  it  cameall  from  one  stroke.  The  rival  captain  also  made  a  4;  but  the  topscorer  among  the  Authors  was  Sir  A.Conan  Doyle,  with  91.  Healso  took  eight  wickets  and  made  victory  sure.  Playing  against  theSavile  Club ,  Abbey  fell  to  one  of  his  own  men,  Mr .  Dermod  O  'Brien,who  had  chosen  to  play  for  the  other  side.  In  this  match  Mr.  S win-stead  made  135.  In  a  match  against  an  Eleven  of  Authors  assembledbyMr.E.W.Hornung  at  Esher,  Abbey  made  o  not  out,  and  caughtMr.  Frankfort  Moore.  Since  Sir  A.  Conan  Doyle  was  on  this  occa-sion able  to  make  only  2,  the  Artists  won.The  first  match  of  the  cricket  week  was  on  the  Balliol  Ground  onJuly  8th,  against  the  "Cygnets  "and  ended  in  a  draw  greatly  in  the"Cygnets"  favour.  On  July  9th,  on  the  Morgan  Hall  ground,  theWiltshire  Wanderers  again  defeated  the  Artists.  "E.  A.  Abbey,  notout,  3 .

The  third  match  the  Artists  won —  against  Mr.R.Dimsdale'sEleven,  the  bowling  of  G.H.Swinstead  being  very  deadly.  Thehighest  scorers  wereA.H.Studd8o,L.D.Luard  30,  and  DermodO'Brien30.  "E.A.Abbey,notout,o."  The  final  match,  against  Mr.H.Milward's  Eleven,  was  lost.  "E.  A.  Abbey,  not  out, 4."In  the  same  month  (July)  is  a  letter  which  lays  new  emphasis  onShakespearean  influence  in  Abbey 's  career.  We  have  seen  him  be-ginning his  life  in  England  by  making  drawings  of  Stratford-on-Avon ;  one  of  his  last  and  finest  English  water-colours  was  the ' '  Mari-ana" from  Me«SMr£/orMeas«re;he  illustrated  the  Comedies;th^oil-painting  to  bring  him  fame  was  the  "  Richard , "  to  b e  followed  byother  Shakespearean  paintings  taken  from  Hamlet,  King  Lear,  TwoGentlemen  of  Verona  ("Who  is  Silvia?"),  Twelfth  Night  ("O  Mis-tress Mine"),  Henry  VI.,  and  Henry  VIII.;  he  designed  completecostumes  for  Richard  II.  for  Irving;  and  he  was  now,  in  1901 ,  medi-tating upon  the  Tragedies  for  Harper's,  which  were  to  occupy  himfor  years.  Even  while  thus  engaged,  a  letter  came  from  the  Univer-sity Press  at  Cambridge,  U.S.A.,  asking  him  to  co-operate  in  the"most  sumptuous  edition  of  Shakespeare's  works  which  has  yetbeen  produced,"  in  forty  volumes,  by  providing  each  volume  witha  frontispiece.  The  Harper  commission  made,  however,  the  accep-tance of  this  invitation  impossible.Concerning  the  illustrations  to  the  Tragedies  (which  have  not  yetb  een  printed  in  b  ook  form)  Abb  ey  was  involved  in  much  correspon-dence with  the  firm.  It  will  be  remembered  that  when  the  illustra-tions to  the  Comedies  were  published  there  was  a  commentary  byAndrew  Lang.  It  was  considered,  however,  that  it  would  be  betterto  give  each  Tragedy  to  a  separate  writer,  and  the  late  TheodoreWatts-Dunton  was,  at  Abbey's  suggestion,  appointed  Editor-in-Chief  of  the  series,  so  far  as  the  literary  side  of  it  was  concerned.Among  the  writers  whom  Abb  ey  suggested  to  assist  the  scheme  wereSwinburne,  Richard  Garnett,  George  Wyndham,  Joseph  Knight,Arthur  Symons,  William  Archer,  and  M.  Jusserand.  Although  it  isanticipating  a  little,  it  may  be  said  that  the  critics  consisted  of  Swin-burne, who  wrote  upon  King  Lear,  Richard II.,  and  Othello;  Joseph3 5 8A  BAND  OF  CRITICSKnight,  on  King  John;  Arthur  Symons  on  Romeo  and  Juliet  andTroilus  and  Cressida;  Ernest  Rhys  on  Richard  III.  and  Henry  VI.;Harold  Hodge  on  Julius  Ccesar  and  Coriolanus;  Lewis  Campbell  onHenry  IV.;  Churton  Collins  on  Henry  VIII.;  William  Sharp  onTimon  and  Titus  Andronicus;  James  Douglas  on  Anthony  and  Cleo-patra; and  F.  Warre  Cornish  on  Henry  V.  Watts-Dunton  wroteuponHamlet,  Macbeth,  Pericles  and  Cymbeline.  The  articles  madeno  reference  to  the  work  of  the  illustrator,  artists  and  critics  beingentirely  independent ;  but  in  one  of  Watts-Dunton's  letters  to  Abbeyis  this  passage  regarding  the  Lear  drawings:  "I  cannot  refrain  fromsending  you  a  word  of  congratulation  upon  your  superb  'Goneril'and  'Regan.'  Swinburne  joins  with  me  in  thinking  that  no  painterhas  ever  been  so  fortunate  in  illustrating  Shakespeare.  They  are  asterrible  as  the  characters  Shakespeare  drew.  If  you  are  only  half  assuccessful  with  any  of  your  other  designs  this  series  will  make  youimmortal."We  shall  come  to  the  illustrations  in  due  course,  as  they  were  fromtime  to  time  published  in  the  magazine.  Enough  to  say  here  thatAbbey  was,  in  July,  1901 ,  at  work  on  Lear  and  Richard  I  I.,  while  hewas  also  turning  now  and  again  to  redrawing,  and  adding  to,  theillustrations  which  he  had  begun  in  1889  for  The  Deserted  Village,and  which  were  to  see  the  light  in  Harper's  Magazine  in  1 902 .In  1901  Abbey  was  elected  to  the  Associateship  of  the  AmericanAcademy  of  Design.  In  this  year  he  was  also  chosen  as  President  ofthe  Royal  Birmingham  Society  of  Artists,  thus  becoming  the  fif-teenth President,  in  succession  to  Sir  Martin  Archer  Shee,P.R.A.(elected  in  1842),  Eastlake,  Grant,  Leighton,  Millais,  Tadema,Burne-Jones,  Watts,  Orchardson,  Herkomer,  Edward  J.Poynter,and  W  .B  .Richmond .  In  1 902  Abbey  was  re-elected  fora  second  year.Abbey's  principal  concern  in  thesecond  half  of  1 901  was,of  course,the  completion  of  the  "Holy  Grail"  paintings —  the  remaining  tenof  which  were  finished  by  the  late  autumn.  A  letter  from  HenryJames  to  Mrs.  Abbey ,  after  a  visit  to  Fairford,  refers  to  one  of  them—the  eleventh — in  which  the  old  King  Amf ortas  dies .  "All  thanks ,too,  for  two  days  that  were,  to  most  monotonous  me,  of  a  cast  really"953HENRY  JAMESromantic ,  partly  because  of  our  castle-crowned  walks  among  goldentrees  and  by  silver  rivers,  and  partly  because  Abbey's  studio  is  initself  the  most  romantic  place  in  this  prosaic  age.  I  retain  a  greatimpression  of  the  mystic  and  wonderful  and  white  samite  processgoing  on  there  and  renew  my  benedictions .  I  hope  he  [Amfortas]  onhis  side  has  not  b  een  reduced  again  to  curses ,  but  is  now  all  perman-ently peaceful  and  painless.  I  felt  a  good  deal  overwhelmed  andcrushed  by  your  Gloucestershire  parkiness  and  amplitude  and  yourautumn  leaves  scattered  on  the  sward  like  sovereigns  on  a  bank-counter;  but  I  am  recovering  myself  a  little,  and  this  little  corner,now  that  I  am  back  here,  affects  me  afresh  as  peculiar  and  special—to  make  up  for  the  lack  of  the  grand,  the  glittering  Gloucestershiregeneralisation."Before  being  taken  to  America  the  paintings  were,  at  the  invita-tion of  the  Corporation  of  London,  exhibited  from  October  28th  toNovember  iQth  at  the  Guildhall,  where  they  excited  great  interest.On  November  23rd  the  artist  and  his  wife  sailed  for  New  York,  tak-ing the  paintings  with  them,  and  these  were  exhibited  again,  at  theAmerican  Art  Association,  in  the  same  room  in  which  the  first  halfhad  been  shown.  In  January,  however,  they  reached  their  abidinghome,  Boston,  where  their  creator  himself  saw  them  safely  set  inplace,  thus  making  a  harmonious  whole  of  the  beautiful  story  whichhe  had  so  long  ago  projected.  While  this  task  was  in  progress  theAbbeys  were  the  guests  of  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Montgomery  Sears  at  12Arlington  Street.  A  letter  from  Mr.  Solomon  Lincoln,  President  ofthe  Trustees  of  the  B  oston  Public  Library,  acknowledging  the  fulfil-ment of  this  notable  commission,  contains  the  following  resolutionpassed  at  the  meeting  of  the  Trustees  on  July  i4th,  1902:'The  Trustees  of  the  Boston  Public  Library  desire  to  express  toMr.  Edwin  A.  Abbey ,  upon  the  completion  of  his  work  for  this  insti-tution, their  great  satisfaction  with  the  subject  he  has  chosen,  andthe  attractive  manner  in  which  it  has  been  executed.  They  hope  thatthe  fine  results  of  Mr.  Abbey's  genius  in  making  so  beautiful  thisroom  of  the  Library  by  the  representation  of  a  romance  dear  to  thepoetical  and  religious  heart  of  Christendom  may  open  newfields3 6 0THE  FRIEZE  COMPLETEfor  his  gifts,  and  in  these  days  of  engrossing  outward  activities  leadmany,  by  the  enjoyment  of  this  painting  to  some  deeper  and  moregenerous  interest  in  Art  and  Literature."Before  leavingfor  England  Abbeyreceived  another  distinction,  inthe  shape  of  an  honorary  degree —  Doctor  of  Laws —  conferred  bythe  University  of  Pennsylvania.  The  date  was  Washington's  birth-day, February  22nd,  1902,  and  Dr. Howard  Furness,  the  Shakes-pearean scholar,  introduced  the  artist  to  the  assembly  in  the  follow-ing terms:  "We  have  invited  to  be  present  on  this  occasion  EdwinAustin  Abbey  because  to  a  rare  degree  he  possesses  a  poet's  fineimagination,  combined  with  a  most  sensitive  eye,  and  interpretedby  a  most  skilful  hand .  What  his '  imagination  bodies  forth '  his  bril-liant pencil  ,  ,turns  ...  to  shapes,  and  gives  to  airy  [gracejA  local  habitation  and  a  name.He  has  shown  his  worship  of  Truth  by  discerning  the  Beautiful  inall  things .  France  has  enrolled  him  in  her '  Legion  of  Honour, '  andthe  Societe  N  ationale  des  B  eaux  Arts  and  the  Konigliche  Akademieof  Bavaria  claim  him  as  an  associate  and  a  peer.  And,  in  addition,  bythe  wide  arch  of  his  fame,  spanning  an  ocean,  he  binds  anew  thatRoyal  Academy  of  Art,  whereof  he  is  a  Fellow,  whose  early  Presidentwas  born,  a  hundred  and  fifty  years  ago,  on  this  happy  soil  which  is'washed  by  the  Delaware's  waters.'  And  yet  in  spite  of  these  loftyhonours  and  incentives  he  persists  in  breaking  the  laws  of  his  own'mute  and  motionless'  art  by  making  his  pictures  speak  and  breathe.Wherefore  we  present  him  to  the  Provost  to  receive  from  the  Uni-versity the  Academic  Degree  of  Doctor  of  Laws."In  Philadelphia  the  new  LL.D.  and  Mrs.  Abbey  stayed  with  thelate  Dr .  J .  William  White ,  and  while  there  paid  a  flying  visit  to  Wash-ington, to  the  White  House,  to  see  President  Roosevelt  and  his  fam-ily, and  to  John  Hay's,  and  Abbey  superintended  the  hanging  of  his' '  Trial  of  Queen  Katharine"  in  the  Corcoran  Gallery  b  ef  ore  it  passedinto  the  private  collection  of  Senator  Clark.  Certain  happenings  atPhiladelphia  which  were  to  have  a  momentous  influence  on  Abbey 'scareer  are  postponed  to  a  later  chapter.3 6 1CHAPTER  XXXVTHE  CORONATION1902King  Edward's  Illness — The  Postponed  Ceremony — Abbey's  Description  of  theService — Abbey  in  the  Cricket  Field — Archbishop  Temple — The  Bruges  Exhi-bition— The  Coronation  Picture — Royal  Interest  and  SuggestionsTHE  great  event  of  1902  was  the  Coronation  of  KingEdward  VII.  ,which  was  made  even  more  noteworthy  bythe  circumstances  which  led  to  its  postponement.  Theceremony,  it  will  be  remembered,  was  fixed  for  June26th;  everything  was  in  readiness;  the  holiday  had  indeed  begun;the  bonfires  were  built,  and  the  oxen  to  be  roasted  whole  were  slain;and  then  like  a  bombshell  came,  on  June  24th,  the  news  that  theKing  was  critically  ill .  Abb  ey ,  however,  had  already  b  egun  his  work,and  for  some  days  had  been  at  Westminster  preparing  his  sketchesin  order  that  his  task  at  the  ceremony  itself,  to  fill  in  the  positions  ofthe  various  chief  actors,  might  be  the  more  readily  accomplished.The  building  was  full  of  carpenters  and  other  operators,  and  thefirstintimation  that  those  there  had  of  it  was  through  the  cessation  of  allwork,  while  everyone  fell  on  his  knees  and  prayers  were  said  for  therecovery  of  the  King.Happily  the  recovery  was  rapid,  and  by  August  9th  his  Majestywas  equal  to  the  ordeal  of  facing  the  deferred  pomp  and  circum-stance. A  letter  from  Abbey  to  Mr.  Alden  of  Harper's  Magazine,  onAugust  1 2th,  tells  us  something  of  the  ceremony;  a  letter  to  his  bro-ther tells  more.  Let  us  take  first  that  to  Mr. Alden:  "Mrs. Abbey  andI  were  in  a  specially  built  box  behind  the  figure  of  Edmund  of  Lan-caster— whose  worn  effigy  with  its  face  turned  to  the  altar  has  beenpresent  at  all  the  coronations  since  1 296 — and  were  the  only  personsnot  connected  with  the  ceremony  who  were  so  close.  I  was  so  nearthat  I  was  able  to  offer  the  old  Archbishop  a  glass  of  wine  when  hewas  carried  (literally  carried)  to  his  chair,  after  the  homage,  by  theBishopsof  London  and  Winchester.  He  didn't  have  it!  Theageand362THE  CORONATIONinfirmity  of  the  Archbishop  (Temple)  made  all  that  part  of  it  mostpathetic.  He  is  nearly  blind — and  his  part  of  the  service  was  printedin  large  letters  on  scrolls,  and  held  up  before  his  face  by  the  Bishopof  Winchester.  It  all  meant  history  and  traditions — and  the  presentrepresentatives  of  historic  names  who  held  hereditary  privileges  cer-tainly looked  their  parts  in  their  robes  and  coronets .  Thefinest  look-ing was  theDukeof  Somerset  with  the'orb.'  He  stands  about  sixfeetsix.  There  is  much  to  remember  and  put  down — and  I  hope  to  beable  to  do  it  as  no  one  else — save  Bodley ,  the  historian  of  the  occasion—is  likely  to — not  being  near  enough  really  to  see  what  went  on."To  his  brother  he  wrote: ' '  I  am  still  in  this  darksome  town  (I  don'tknow  when  I  have  been  here  before  at  this  time  of  year)  getting  to-gether the  composition  for  my  picture  of  the  great  event.  This  is  noteasy ,  for  the  principal  personages  insisted  upon  standing  in  front  ofeach  other  and  spoiling  thegeneral  effect,  which  was  really  magnifi-cent. We  left  here  about  7.30  a.m.,  and  got  into  the  line  of  carriagesin  about  ten  minutes .  Our  cards  admitted  us  to  the  west  door,  wherethe  Kings  and  Court  entered,  and  the  peers  and  peeresses.  Thelatter  had  their  trains  let  down  for  them  and  spread  upon  the  floorby  two  gentlemen.  Nobody  but  peeresses  had  trains  upon  this  occa-sion   We  marched  up  the  dark  nave — it  was  very  dark — whereonly  a  few  people  were  as  yet  seated.  The  only  one  I  knew  was  SirHarry  Johnston,  who  was  a  painter  before  he  was  an  explorer.  Hewore  the  green  silk  mantle  of  the  Victorian  Order,  and  everybodyhad  something  unaccustomed  on.  Judges  in  wigs  and  gowns — andall  sorts  of  doctors  and  members  of  various  orders — heralds  in  tab-ards and  gentlemen  of  the  Court  in  white  knee-breeches  and  stock-ings and  gold-embroidered  coats.  I  might  have  worn  my  Pennsyl-vanian  gown  and  hood,butl  forgot  it,  and  wore  only  the  R .  A .  court-dress  of  dark  purple  cloth  and  gold  braid.  The  sword  was  awfully  intheway  inthecarriage,andalsoinmyboxintheAbbey.  .  .  Gertrudewore  the  dress  she  wore  at  the  Court — minus  the  train.  In  the  choirstalls  we  stopped  to  talk  to  the  Douglas  Robinsons  and  congratu-lated them  on  their  splendid  places.  Mrs.  Robinson  is  PresidentRoosevelt's  sister,  and  was  specially  invited.363THE  CORONATION"We  walked  to  my  place  in  the  tomb  of  Edmund  of  Lancaster('  Crookback') ,  who  had  been  lying  there  since  1 296  — quite  a  while.After  I  got  all  my  chairs  settled,  and  my  easel  and  sketch  books  ar-ranged, I  went  out  to  see  the  peeresses  arrive.  It  was  a  sight  indeed .They  had  white  satin  dresses  and  long  trains  of  crimson  velvet  andermine  capes — trains  arid  their  coronets  in  their  hands.  They  cameby  twos  and  threes  and  dozens,  and  were  marvellous  to  behold.  Inever  saw  so  many  jewels  in  my  life.  They  were  on  the  side  that  Iwas — in  the  north  transept —  but  I  couldn't  get  across  the  'theatre,'which  occupied  the  whole  middle  of  it.  We  were  a  little  too  early,and  might  as  well  have  been  half  an  hour  later — when  the  nave  andchoir  would  have  been  full,  but  after  all  we  saw  more  than  we  couldhold,  and  it  was  fortunate  I  had  been  able  to  sketch  at  the  rehearsalsor  I  should  have  been  in  a  great  muddle.  Unfortunately  the  morn-ing was  very  dull  and  dark,  and  the  Abbey,  always  a  gloomy  place,was  so  dark  that  it  was  difficult  to  see  details .  I  n  front  of  us  were  theArchbishop  of  York,  the  Bishops  of  London,  Ely,  and  Winchester  intheir  copes,  and,  at  the  right,  some  thirty  other  bishops  who  did  nottake  part  in  the  service.  We  were  very  near —  almost  too  near  attimes    The  poor  little  Dean  (Bradley)  ..  .  almost  dropped  theChalice  and  forgot  to  give  it  to  the  Queen  until  he  was  prompted.B  etween  the  Dean  and  the  Archbishop ,  who  is  very  tottery  and  quiteblind,  we  all  had  many  anxious  moments."You  will  probably  have  read  many  accounts  of  it  all.  Most  ofthose  I  have  seen  are  inaccurate,  and  the  pictures  absolutely  so,principally  because  the  authors  could  not  possibly  see  what  wenton.  .  .  .  We  were  provisioned  with  some  Tlasmon'  biscuits,  somesandwiches,  and  a  bottle  of  Hock!  We  got  away —  with  difficulty—about  two,  and  into  the  headmaster's  of  Westminster  School —  Dr.Gow,  in  Dean's  Yard — where  we  lunched .  A  very  highly  decorativeluncheon  party —  Tadema  and  Poynter  in  all  their  ribbons  and  or-ders, Justice  Phillimore  in  all  his  gorgeousness  of  scarlet  gown  andfull-bottomed  wig,  and  many  ladies.  It  was  a  very  remarkable  day."I  have  in  the  studio  here  the  King's  'colobium,'  'sindonis'  and'supertunica,'  and  stole  of  cloth  of  gold  embroidered  with  the  rose,3%THE  ROYAL  VESTMENTSshamrock,  thistle,  and  gryphon — rather  handsome,  but  not  good  inshape,  and  too  brassy  a  gold  to  be  good.  I've  also  Lord  Lansdowne'scoronet  and  gown,  Lord  Colville's  ditto,  the  Bishop  of  Oxford'scope,  the  Herald's  crown  and  tabard,  the  Serjeant  of  the  House  ofCommons's  coat  and  breeches,  and  various  other  properties.  I  amto  have  all  the  vestments  and  togs  generally,  and  have  the  wholecomposition  in,  and  hope  to  get  the  whole  thing  underway  and  wellon  by  the  spring — when  I  shall  have  sittings  for  the  portraits.  I  amgoing  down  to  Betteshanger  to-morrow  to  stop  with  Lord  North-bourne,  who  has  arranged  to  drive  me  over  to  Canterbury,  and  hasarranged  with  the  Archbishop  to  sit  to  me.  I  'm  afraid  the  old  gentle-man is  not  long  for  this  world.' '  I  am  nearly  done  to  death,  and  have  had  no  breathing  time  sinceI  saw  you.  I  had  promised  to  get  some  Shakespeare  drawings  donefor  Harper's,  and  wired  into  them  when  the  postponement  came,and  Dr.  Morgan  worries  me  about  his  reredos;  but  I  shall  hope  thatfresh  air  will  help  me  up  again,  for  I  am  run  down    Igotoneday'scricket  v.  Conan  Doyle  and  Hornung's  Eleven.  We  beat  'em —  112to  iy3,Ithink.  I  did  little  (as  usual),  but  liked  the  sunshine."It  was  in  this  match,  in  which  I  also  was  taking  part,  that  I  firstmet  Abbey .  I  remember  how  struck  I  was  by  his  keenness,  marvel-ling that  an  American  should  so  throw  himself  into  our  game.  Iremember  also  thinking  that  Abbey's  spectacles  and  himself  wereone  and  corporate —  they  so  shone  and  twinkled  and  drove  his  goodhumour  and  high  spirits  home.  I  was  struck,  too,  by  his  watchful-ness in  the  field ;  although  not  captain  of  the  side,  he  kept  a  masterfuleye  on  every  phase  of  the  game.  It  was  easy,  even  in  the  relaxationof  flannels,  to  see  that  this  man  had  efficiency  and  grasp.ThelettertoWilliamAbbeybeginsinAugust,andnothavingbeenposted  was  added  to  more  than  a  month  later,  on  September  25th:"The  old  gentleman  [Archbishop  Temple]  was  very  cheery  and  re-sented the  suggestion  that  he  was  feeble  anywhere  but  in  his  knees  !I  made  some  sketches,  while  Mrs.  Temple  took  Gertrude  to  see  theAustralians  play  Kent.  We  lunched  there,  and  then  we  all  went  tothe  cricket  match."  When  the  party  reached  the  cricket  ground  Ab-VOL.II. — H  365ARCHBISHOP  TEMPLEbey  proposed  that  the  Archbishop  should  change  places  with  himin  the  carriage  and  thus  have  a  better  view  of  the  game.  But  hewouldnot.  "No,  no, "he  said,  "it  would  be  of  nouse,forl  can'tseeso  far  as  that  any  longer.  Butlliketoheartheclickoftheball."  Theold  prelate  also,  on  another  occasion  during  this  visit,  remarked  toAbbey  that  he  was  surprised  that  no  painter  had,  to  his  knowledge,ever  taken  as  a  subj  ect  the  words  in  Psalm  cvii . , "  They  that  go  downto  the  sea  in  ships,  that  do  business  in  great  waters.""Betteshanger  being  so  near  Dover —  only  eight  miles  distant—[Abbey's  letter  to  his  brother  continues]  we  went  on  to  see  theBruges  Exhibition  of  Gothic  art  for  a  couple  of  days,  and  then  backhere  (Morgan  Hall).  I  was  pretty  thoroughly  tired  out  and  sleptnearly  a  week!  I've  had  to  work  hard  again,  however,  to  get  thepicture  together.  These  bishops  are  so  fussy  about  their  copes.I've  still  got  the  Archbishop  of  York's,  but  I  expect  more  nextweek.  I've  got  the  carpet  and  all  the  hangings  and  embroideredarms  from  the  front  of  the  Royal  Box.  The  carpet  is  magnificent,and  is  insured  for  £12,000!  It  leaves  my  care  to-morrow,  thankgoodness!"Since  we  have  seen  Abbey  launched  on  this  Coronation  picture,it  may  be  as  well  to  advance  a  little  into  time  and  complete  its  story.The  moment  chosen  by  the  artist  for  his  picture  is  when  the  Arch-bishopof  Canterbury, with  arms  uplifted, holds  the  ImperialCrownbetweenhis  hands  and  is  about  to  place  it  upon  the  head  of  the  King,who,  clothed  in  robes  of  State,  is  seated  in  the  Coronation  Chair,while  Princes  and  Peers  raise  their  coronets  and  lead  the  "GreatShout"  of  the  people,  "God  Save  the  King!"  A  ray  of  sunshinesuddenly  lightens  the  gloom  of  a  dark  day  and  falls  directly  uponthe  King.  Beside  him  stands  the  Bishop  of  Bath  and  Wells,  directlybehind  whom  are  the  Prince  of  Wales,  the  Duke  of  Connaught,  andthe  aged  Duke  of  Cambridge.  To  the  right  of  these,  occupying  allthe  south  transept ,  are  the  Peers  in  their  robes  of  crimson  velvet  withcapes  of  ermine.  The  Peeresses  occupy  the  north  transept,  and  aretherefore  not  visible  in  the  picture.  In  raised  seats  over  the  Peersare  the  members  of  the  House  of  Commons  and  their  wives.3 6 6THE  NOBLE  COMPANYClose  behind  Archbishop  Temple,  and  destined  to  succeed  him,stands  Dr.  Davidson,  Bishop  of  Winchester,  who  bears  the  Chalice,and  is  the  Prelate  of  the  Order  of  the  Garter.  At  the  Bishop's  left  isthe  aged  Dean  of  Westminster,  Dr.  Bradley,  and  directly  behindthese,  in  a  line,  are  the  Archbishop  of  York,  in  white  and  gold,  whois  presently  to  crown  the  Queen,  the  Bishop  of  London,  in  red  andgold,  who  bears  the  Bible,  and  the  Bishop  of  Ely,  who  bears  thepatina.  Only  two  other  bishops  appear, the  supporters  of  the  Queen,who  stands  b  etween  them :  on  her  left  the  Bishop  of  Oxford ,  diocesanof  Windsor,  and  on  her  right  the  Bishop  of  Norwich,  diocesan  ofSandringham.  At  her  left,  behind  her,  stands  the  Lady  of  the  Bed-chamber, the  Duchess  of  Buccleuch.  The  foremost  figure  in  thegroup  to  the  right  of  these  is  the  Duke  of  Norfolk,  Hereditary  Earl-Marshal,  and,  as  such,  the  chief  organiser  of  the  Coronation  cere-monial. About  him  are  grouped  Dukes,  Field-Marshals,  and  lead-ing statesmen.  To  his  right  are  Lord  Roberts,  Lord  Wolseley,  LordHarris,  the  Duke  of  Marlborough,the  Duke  of  Fife;  close  behindthese  is  the  tall  figure  of  the  Duke  of  Somerset;  next  him  is  the  Dukeof  Argyll,  and  beyond  is  the  Duke  of  Devonshire,  in  front  of  whom,in  his  robes  of  office ,  is  the  Lord  Chancellor,  Lord  Halsbury .  At  theextreme  left  of  the  picture  is  Mr .  Balf  our ,  who  was  there  not  becausehe  was  Prime  Minister  of  England,  but  because  he  held  the  office  ofLord  Privy  Seal.Above  the  Queen,  in  a  tribune  specially  erected ,  are  the  Princessesof  England,  together  with  some  of  the  Princes  united  to  them  bymarriage,  and  the  Royal  children.  The  prominent  figures  in  the  im-mediate foreground  on  the  right  of  the  picture  are  there  by  heredi-tary right — the  Marquis  of  Cholmondeley,  hereditary  Lord  GreatChamberlain,  Viscount  Churchill,  acting  Lord  Chamberlain,  andbetween  them  Mr.  H.F.  Burke,  Rouge  Croix  Pursuivant  of  Arms.Behind  them  are  Sir  Hugh  Gough  and  Mr.  H .  D .  Erskine .  The  artistoccupied  a  position  in  a  specially  constructed  box  in  the  tomb  ofEdmund  of  Lancaster  ('Crouchback'),  on  a  lev  el  with  and  directlyfacing  the  tribune  of  Royal  Princesses,  and  at  an  equal  distance  fromthe  King.36?AN  EXACTING  TASKAbbey  settled  down  quietly  to  his  great  task  and  worked  at  theCoronation  picture  steadily  all  through  the  winter  while  he  was  inthe  country.  By  that  time,  having  every  position  established  andthe  costumes  painted  in,  he  was  ready  in  the  spring  of  1903  for  theillustrious  company  to  sit.  But  they  were  not,  at  first,  all  equallyready  for  him,  and  the  picture  could  not  be  finished  until  1 904,  whenit  was  exhibited  in  London  and  elsewhere  before  being  set  up  in  itsplace  in  Buckingham  Palace.  Abbey,  it  is  possible,  would  have  beena  happier  man  had  he  been  able  to  refuse  the  commission,  for  itdeprived  him  of  that  freedom  by  which  he  lived,  and  he  felt  theshackles.  For  example,  in  a  letter  to  William  Laffan,  he  says:  "TheCoronation  picture  grows    but  I  somehow  prefer  to  invent  some-thing. This  doing  just  what  you  saw  instead  of  what  you  dreamedis  confusing."The  story  has  often  been  told — it  was,  indeed,  a  commonplace  ofthe  obituary  notices  of  Abbey  in  the  American  papers — that  he  wasexasperated  by  theunpunctuality  of  his  exalted  sitters;  but  that  wasnot  so.  With  an  exception  or  two — in  each  case  the  defect  beingquickly  amended — the  artist  received  every  consideration,  and  fromno  one  more  than  King  Edward  and  Queen  Alexandra.  Originallythe  figure  of  the  King  was  painted  entirely  covered  by  the  robes  ofState,  as  it  was  during  the  ceremony,  but  later,  to  Abbey's  great  re-gret, by  the  express  wish  of  the  King,  who  desired  that  the  Gartermight  be  visible,  the  robe  of  cloth-of-gold  was  thrown  back,  thusuncovering  the  legs.CHAPTER  XXXVIASSISTANTSMasters  and  Pupils  in  Art — Mr.  F.

G.  Simmonds— Care  of  Books— Sentential— The  Bible — A  TributeIT  was  during  his  work  on  the  Coronation  picture  that  Abbeyrealised  the  absolute  necessity  of  an  assistant,  and  from  thistime  (1902)  onward,  when  he  was  occupied  by  the  decorationsfor  the  Capitol  at  Harrisburg,  there  was  usually  a  young  artist,and  sometimes  two,  at  work  with  him  in  the  studio.  His  choice  in1902  fell  upon  Mr.  Frank  Cadogan  Cowper,  now  an  A.R.A. ,  butthen  a  student  of  five-and-twenty,  just  out  of  the  Royal  AcademySchools,  full  of  purpose  and  ambition  and  not  less  sincere  in  hisdesire  for  truth  than  the  painter  for  whom  he  was  to  work.  Mr.Cowper's  engagement  began  in  August,  1902,  and  lasted  until  thefollowing  spring,  when  he  went  abroad.  Those  who  assisted  afterMr.  Cowper  were  Mr.Ernest  Board,  Mr.  F.G.  Swaish,  and  Mr.  W.G.  Simmonds;  and  although  all  three  belong  to  a  period  later  thanthe  years  with  which  we  are  now  concerned,  their  help  being  re-quired upon  the  Harrisburg  commission,  this  is  as  good  a  place  asany  in  which  to  assemble  their  memories  of  the  artist  whom  theyserved  and  loved.The  records  of  the  cricket  weeks  have  shown  us  in  what  affectionAbbey  was  held  by  men  at  play.  That  men  at  work  with  him  wereno  less  devoted  we  are  about  to  see.  But  before  coming  to  the  per-sonal recollections  of  Abbey  which  have  kindly  been  written  for  thisbook,  there  are  some  remarks  by  Mr.  Cowper  on  the  value  to  youthof  working  for  and  under  the  direction  of  maturity  which  ought  tobe  quoted.  "It  always,"  he  writes,  "seems  to  me  that  the  art  of  thecountry  would  benefit  enormously  if  the  old  system  of  great  pain-ters taking  young  students  into  their  studios  as  pupils  and  assistantscould  be  revived — that  is  to  say,  the  system  of  apprenticeship .  Alma369MASTERS  AND  PUPILSTadema,  Napier  Hemy,  H.  de  Braekeleer,  the  Belgian,  and  otherswho  have  since  risen  to  fame,  all  worked  in  this  way  as  assistants  inthe  studio  of  Baron  Henri  Leys,  of  Antwerp,  and  in  this  way  they  intheir  turn  became  masters  of  their  craft,  learning  infinitely  morethan  they  could  have  done  if  they  had  merely  gone  to  an  art  schooland  then  started  in  studios  by  themselves.  It  was,  of  course,  alwaysso  with  the  Old  Masters,  only  they  began  as  pupils  and  assistants  inthe  great  artists'  studios  at  a  very  early  age  indeed — sometimes  atnine  or  ten  years  old— so  that  by  the  time  they  were  twenty  yearsold  and  had  got  something  to  say  in  the  form  of  art,  they  could  sayit,  instead  of  being  still  in  the  elementary  student  stage,  as  nowadaysat  that  age  artists  generally  are."Mr.Cowper's  recollections  of  Abbey  begin  with  1896,  when,  atnineteen  years  of  age,  he  was  studying  at  the  St.  John's  Wood  Schoolof  Art.  It  was  the  year  of  the  "Richard, "and  all  the  St.  John's  Woodstudents,  Mr.  Cowper  says,  "became  more  or  less 'Abbey  mad, 'andthe  sketches  at  the  monthly  competitions  reflected  the  influence  ofthis  picture — my  own  sketches  among  them .  But  I  soon  learnt  thatI  ought  to  have  been  better  acquainted  with  Abbey's  work  already,and  with  the  assistance  of  a  fellow  student  who  was  more  learned  init,  I  set  about  collecting  the  illustrations  to  the  Comedies  of  Shake-speare, and  other  drawings  of  his  which  had  appeared  in  Harper'sMagazine.  From  this  time  onwards  I  followed  his  work  with  themost  immense  admiration,  and  the  succeeding  years  of  the  AcademyExhibitions  are  associated  in  my  mind  with  each  of  Abbey's  greathistorical  or  Shakespearean  pictures."Not  until  1 902 ,  however,  did  the  pupil  and  master  meet ,  and  then,after  trying  to  find  abuyer  for  Mr.  Cowper's  picture  of  thegraveyardscene  in  Hamlet  (now  in  the  Queensland  Gallery),  which  was  inthe  Academy  of  that  year,  and  putting  some  illustrating  in  his  way,Abbey  invited  him  to  assist  with  details  of  the  Coronation.  "Mymind,  "says  Mr.  Cowper,  "was  running  on  romantic  pictures  of  myown,  but  I  knew  what  a  chance  it  was  to  go  and  work  in  the  studioof  agreat  painter  like  Abbey."  Mr.  Cowper  began  at  Chelsea  Lodge;later  he  went  toFairford.  Of  this  experience  he  says,  "It  was  the3 7 °THE  FAIRFORD  WINDOWSmost  delightful  time  of  my  life.  Morgan  Hall,  itself,  presided  overby  Mrs.  Abbey ,  was  a  most  charming  house,  and  everywhere  I  wentabout  the  garden  and  park  I  was  reminded  of  her  husband's  draw-ings or  pictures .  The  village  of  Fairf  ord  seemed  entirely  in  keepingwith  his  work —  and  the  famous  Fairf  ord  church  windows,  which  Isaw  then  for  the  first  time  and  which  were  a  tremendous  joy  to  me,seemed  to  my  enthusiastic  mind  to  have  the  spirit  of  Abbey ,  thoughI  don't  know  how  this  should  be,  unless,  as  I  have  often  thoughtpossible,  these  windows  had  a  certain  influence  upon  his  work.*"I  was  soon  to  learn  how  appallingly  ignorant  I  was,  and  howslipshod  in  my  methods  of  work — Abbey's  knowledge  was  simplyastonishing.  His  long  life  as  an  illustrator  from  an  early  age  had  madehim  a  perfect  mine  of  knowledge  upon  anything  to  do  with  a  subjectpicture.  He  had  travelled  and  studied  everywhere  in  Europe  insearch  of  material  for  his  work.  I  think  there  must  have  been  verylittle  he  did  not  know  about  architecture, costume, furniture, the  artsand  manners  and  customs  of  all  periods  of  history  or  anything  to  dowith  an  historical  picture.  He  said  to  me  once,  talking  of  historicalsubjects:  'Always  look  up  three  times  as  much  as  you  will  want  toput  into  a  picture . '  And  it  is  this  thoroughness  which  makes  his  workso  interesting,  whether  illustrations  or  pictures.  Most  illustratorsare  content  when  they  have  learnt  up  barely  enough  of  their  subjectto  get  them  through  with  their  drawing.  I  saw  him  do  many  of  theShakespeare  drawings  for  Harper's,  and  though  the  actual  drawingitself  would  only  take  him  an  hour  or  two,  he  would  take  days  andweeks  to  get  up  material  for  each  one,  getting  new  costumes  madeand  more  books  to  study  the  subject,  though  his  stock  of  dresses  ofevery  period  and  his  library  of  books  would  have  seemed  to  anyoneelse  to  be  already  enough  for  the  task  in  hand .  He  always  said : '  Eco-nomise everywhere  else,  but  don't  ever  economise  in  the  studio.'"IworkedinAbbey'sstudiosixmonthsonly,andafterwardswishedI  had  stayed  on  longer.  But  he  had  been  so  good  as  to  get  me  someA  portion  of  one  of  these  windows — thewest — is  tobe  seen  inMr.Cowper'sown  picture,exhibited  in  the  Academy  of  1907, "The  Devil  Disguised  as  aTroubadorSinging  to  Nuns."One  of  the  windows  appears  in  a  drawing  by  Abbey  for  The  Quiet  Life:  an  illustration  for"The  Vicar,"  made  in  1886,  when  on  a  visit,  long  before  Fairford  was  his  home.3 7   iA  CITIZEN  OF  THE  WORLDcommissions  for  pictures,  and  I  was  longing  to  go  away  in  the  springto  Italy,  which  he  had  advised  me  to  do.  But  ever  after  this  I  felt  Ihad  a  friend  in  him,  whom  I  could  go  to  for  advice  upon  any  matter.For  he  was  always  kindness  itself  in  the  pains  he  would  take  to  criti-cise and  help  a  young  painter  with  his  work.  And  to  many  young  menbeside  myself  he  gave  a  start  in  life  by  obtaining  commissions  forthem  and  introducing  them  to  collectors  of  works  of  art.  He  wouldalways  help  a  young  painter  in  any  way  he  could  if  he  thought  he  wasin  earnest  with  his  work."With  regard  to  Abbey  himself — he  impressed  me  always  as  oneof  the  most  charming  men  I  ever  knew,  andavery  lovable  character.There  was  nothing  mean  or  small  about  him.  He  had  big  and  nobleideas .  One  thing  he  hated  was  a  business  instinct  in  an  artist .  Thoughhe  was  constantly  saying  funny  things ,  we  felt  all  the  time  that  therewas  something  very  wise  about  him.  One  peculiarity  I  noticed  wasthat  he  had  the  faculty  of  divided  attention .  I  n  a  room  with  a  numberof  people  talking  he  could  talk  in  his  usual  delightful  way  to  one  per-son or  group ,  while  all  the  time  he  was  able  to  attend  to  what  anothergroup  in  another  part  of  the  room  was  saying,  and  presently  he  wouldcross  over  to  them  and  join  in  their  conversation,  having  followed  itapparently  from  the  first."Thoroughly  Am  erican— and  he  impressed  you  as  b  eing  an  Ameri-can by  his  accent  as  soon  as  he  spoke — he  loved  all  English  things.He  told  me  his  people  a  few  generations  back  came  from  a  certainvillage  in  Wiltshire  [Avebury] ,  and  he  wondered  if  he  would  evergo  and  live  there  again.  I  always  felt  he  was  very  cosmopolitan.  Heseemed  to  me  to  be  in  touch  with  all  that  was  going  on  in  the  twohemispheres,  unlike  many  English  artists  who  seem  hardly  to  havebeen  outside  England  or  even  their  own  suburb.  I  felt  that  Abbeywas  a  citizen  of  the  whole  world.  But  he  loved  all  the  old  things  ofEngland  better  than  anything."Latterly  I  thought  his  expression  became  very  noble  looking,and  he  reminded  me  curiously  of  the  portraits  of  Ingres  at  that  age. ' 'After  Mr.  Cowper  came  Mr.  Board,  then  Mr.  Swaish,  and  lastlyMr.  Simmonds.  "My  recollections  of  my  late  master,"  writes  Mr.3 7 2THE  FRIEND  OF  YOUTHBoard,  "are  very  dear  to  me — no  experience  has  been  so  delightfulas  the  period  spent  working  for  him  as  his  assistant.  His  greatenthusiasm  in  his  work,  his  kindly  encouragement  of  my  modestefforts,  his  sweet  temper,  and  inimitable  sense  of  humour  madehim  a  man  one  was  bound  to  become  intensely  attached  to.  Undersuch  an  influence,  naturally,  the  work  went  on  with  quite  joyousenthusiasm."I  first  met  Mr.  Abbey  at  the  Academy  schools  when  I  was  a  stu-dent there.  He  was  putting  in  one  of  his  few  appearances  as  'visitor.'It  was  evening  Life  Class,  and  he  somewhat  broke  the  usual  con-ventions by  going  round  the  class  in  his  shirt  sleeves  and  hat .  At  thattime  we  students  were  very  full  of  him,  and  his  visit  filled  us  withpleasure  and  excitement .  What  struck  me  most  about  him  then  werehis  wonderful  penetrating  eyes — so  penetrating  that  it  was  not  untilI  had  known  him  for  some  considerable  time  that  I  could  face  themwithout  a  certain  feeling  of  embarrassment."Mr.  Simmonds,  as  we  shall  see,  corroborates  this  statement  as  tothe  painter's  eyes .  He  also  extends  the  remarks  on  Abbey 's  relationswith  young  artists,  in  the  following  terms:  "His  wide  interest  instudents  and  young  artists  was  always  evident,  not  the  patronisingkind  of  interest,  for  he  recognised  the  mutual  advantage  of  inter-course between  the  experienced  man  of  long  practice  and  the  youngman  with  new  points  of  view.  He  always  said  he  expected  to  learnsomething  from  us,  while  telling  us  all  that  he  thought  could  be  use-ful. From  casual  remarks,  one  found  that  he  kept  these  young  menand  their  work  always  in  mind;  his  aim  being,  as  he  expressed  it,  'toget  the  right  man  into  the  right  niche.'  But  he  said,  'It  is  difficult  tofind  niches  for  everyone  ! '  I  believe  he  judged  all  artists  entirely  ontheir  ability,  without  allowing  anything  else  to  influence  him,  andhe  always  treated  slackers  with  prompt  severity.  When  talking  ofstudents  he  said,  'The  more  a  man  knows,  the  longer  it  takes  you  tofind  out  how  much  he  knows.'  One  piece  of  advice  which  he  gaveand  always  followed  himself  was  that  when  you  come  to  the  stickingplace  in  a  picture,  you  must  attack  it  with  all  your  energies  and  makeit  the  best  part."373WORK  AND  RELAXATIONSMr. Board's  narrative  is  now  resumed:  "Mr.  Abbey  was  an  inces-sant worker.  The  day 's  work  usually  began  about  9.30  and  from  thenuntil  the  light  failed  he  would  be  closely  engaged  with  the  particularwork  in  hand.  When  I  say 'closely  engaged  'I  do  not  mean  he  was'glued' to  the  canvas  all  day.  This  he  did  not  believe  in.  He  con-sidered it  made  one  stale,  so  it  was  his  habit  every  now  and  then  toleave  the  studio ,  and — when  at  Fairford — to  take  a  brisk  walk  roundhis  grounds.  In  London  he  was  restricted  to  roaming  about  thehouse  for  his  change.  In  summer-time,  after  a  hard  day's  painting,he  would  get  out  his  cricket  gear,  or  baseball  and  club ,  and  we  wouldall  troop  out  to  the  park,  and  very  enjoyable  games  we  had  there,  noone  more  keen  and  'boyish'  than  he  was.  But  I  always  felt  verynervous,  knowing  his  short-sightedness,  when  he  recklessly  facedrather  terrific  'throwing  in'  at  baseball.  Fortunately  nothing  hap-pened, but  I  always  feared  it  would  at  any  moment."Mr.  Simmonds  again  comes  in  here,  with  an  amplification  of  thispassage:  "Few  things  pleased  Abbey  better  than  to  take  up  a  goodcatch.  We  sometimes  put  the  baseball  up  with  a  staff  as  high  as  wecould  or  threw  it  with  all  our  force  directly  at  him,  and  he  alwayscaught  it  very  neatly .  His  other  more  frequent  form  of  exercise  wasa  sharp  excursion  round  the  grounds  while  the  model  rested,  andwhen  not  working  from  the  model  he  refreshed  himself  at  regularintervals  in  the  same  way,  returning  with  new  vigour  and  the  useful'fresh  eye'  to  his  work.  Sometimes  the  hunt  would  pass  through  ornear  the  grounds,  and  Giles,  the  gardener,  would  burst  into  thestudio  and  give  word,  when  there  would  be  a  general  stampede  tosee  them,  Abbey  well  to  the  fore."Mr.  Board  again:  "Abbey  used  to  say  he  obtained  his  humorousfaces  for  his  Shakespearean  and  other  illustrations  in  the  mirrorwhile  shaving,  at  other  times  he  drew  himself  reflected  in  a  three-leaved  mirror.  As  a  visitor  at  the  R.A.  Schools  I  fancy  hewas  rathernervous,  and  often,  when  handing  back  charcoal  or  stumps  aftercorrecting  our  drawings ,  he  would  apologise  for  making'such  a  messof  it.'  He  always  worked  in  an  old  soft  felt  hat,  with  a  hole  in  thecrown  for  ventilation,  and  the  brim  well  pulled  down  to  shade  his374SONG  AND  STORYeyes.  He  was  by  no  means  a  silent  worker.  He  loved  to  have  abouthim  people  that  he  could  talk  to .  H  e  often  sang  at  his  work ,  generallysome  old  ballad.  I  canhearhim  now  trolling  out 'Jock  of  Hazeldean'with  a  most  decided  American  accent .  His  unending  supply  of  hum-orous anecdotes  and  his  deliciously  droll,  drawly  way  of  telling  themkept  those  around  him  in  good  humour  the  whole  day  long. "On  this  pointMr.Swaish  also  insists. "If  astory/'hewrites, "cameto  Mr. Abbey's  mind  while  heworked  he  appeared  not  to  have  thepower  to  resist  coming  to  tell  it  me  at  once.  The  studio  at  Fairfordwas  divided  across  the  middleby  oneof  the  huge  canvaseswhich  arenow  in  the  dome  of  the  State  Capitol  at  Harrisburg.  He  usually  wasat  work  on  one  side  making  studies  and  so  on,  and  I  was  clamberingup  and  down  on  the  other  enlarging  these  and  painting  them  in  onthe  business  side  cf  the  canvas.  And  although  we  could  talk  to  oneanother  quite  easily  from  where  we  worked  he  preferred  usually  tosqueeze  through  between  the  end  of  the  canvas  and  the  wall  anddeliver  his  yarn  on  my  side  of  the  canvas.  Then  back  he  would  go,evidently  feeling  relieved."It  will  be  best  to  postpone  to  a  later  chapter  Mr.  Board's  remarkson  certain  original  methods  employed  by  Abbey  for  his  great  Harris-burg  compositions —  closing  these  interesting  notes  with  an  anec-dote which  might  have  found  a  place  in  du  Maurier's  Punch  series:' '  What  our  Artist  has  to  put  up  with . ' '  Abbey  was  showing  his  pictureof  King  Lear's  daughters.  "After  a  long  and  silent  examination  ofthepicture, his  visitor  remarked  in  reverential  tones,  'Ah,  Tennysonwas  a  great  poet.'  In  conclusion, "says  Mr.  Board,  "I  would  like  tosay  that  Mr.  Abbey  was  the  kindest  and  most  lovable  man  I  think  Ihave  ever  met."AftermentioningAbbey's"generosity,hissympathy,andhisfree-dom  from  every  affectation,"  Mr.  Swaish  remarks:  "Though  I  wasbut  a  very  humble  (an  inexperienced  at  first)  assistant  to  him ,  he  didmoretomakemefeelthatpossiblymyobscureinfluenceontheworldof  Art  may  be  of  value  than  anyone  I  ever  met.  He  quite  workedto  dispel  my  youthful  diffidence  and  set  me  going  in  a  directionthat  would  offer  scope  for  what  he  kindly  thought  were  my  powers.375MASTER  AND  ASSISTANTSHis  memory ,  of  course ,  was  almost  unique  and  anything  he  ever  sawseemed  to  be  stored  in  a  place  always  at  hand  when  he  wanted  it.  Hewas  so  modest  and  unassertive  that  I  always  found  it  difficult  to  bearin'mind  that  he  was  the  great  man  that  he  was.  Whenever  we  hadany  visitors  that  were  numbered  among  the  'great,'  he  always  intro-duced his  assistants  in  a  way  that  conveyed  the  impression  to  methat  as  long  as  a  man  was  an  artist  he  had  the  qualification  to  b  e  num-.  .  Mr. Abbey,  when  I  was  there  alone,worked  like  a  Trojan  at  the  piano-player  for  my  delight.  He  lovedmusic,  and  when  he  knew  I  did  it  seemed  to  give  him  great  pleasureto  enjoy  it  with  me."bered with  the  great,  too.  .Mr.  Swaish  concludes:  "I  am  glad  at  least  to  have  the  opportunityof  recording  to  you  my  great  regard  and  esteem  for  Mr.  Abbey,  andI  am  increasingly  thankful  for  the  privilege  accorded  me  of  workingfor  and  with  him . "Mr .  W .  G .  Simmonds ,  who  was  with  Abbey  during  the  last  monthsof  his  life,  and  who  after  Abbey 's  death  went  out  to  Harrisburg  withMrs.  Abbey  to  touch  up  and  repair  any  blemishes  that  might  haveb  een  caused  to  the  decorations  in  transit  and  while  being  fixed  to  thewalls,  writes  thus:  "The  first  thing  that  struck  me  in  Abbey's  ap-pearance on  meeting  him  was  the  penetrating  brown  eyes,  whichsearched  you  enquiringly  while  he  was  talking  and  always  with  anunderlying  merriment  which  soon  assured  you  of  his  genial  warmthof  disposition  and  very  keen  sense  of  humour .  On  further  acquaint-ance I  remarked  his  great  energy,  and  the  severity  with  which  hekept  his  whole  mind  on  his  work — when  in  normal  health— alwayswith  good  temper  and  buoyant  spirits,  the  last  being  displayed  inhis  walk,  which  was  always  light  and  youthful.  He  was  very  mus-cularly  strong  to  within  quite  a  short  time  of  his  illness."I  always  noticed  his  great  affection  for  books  and  the  care  withwhich  he  handled  them .  H  e  told  me  that  once  when  he  was  helpingHenry  Irving  with  his  proposed  production  ofRichardll.  he  neededsome  illustrations  from  a  valuable  book  in  Irving's  library,  and  washorrified  to  see  Irving  cut  the  pages  out  and  hand  them  to  him,  tell-ing him  to  take  them,  as  the  book  could  not  very  well  be  spared—3 7 6IRVING'S  VANDALISMIrving  evidently  ready  to  sacrifice  anything  to  drama.  Abbey  wasalso  very  fond  of  music  and  sometimes  played  very1  delicately  oldEnglish  tunes  and  folk  songs,  of  which  he  knew  a  great  number."I  am  afraid,"  writes  Mr.Simmonds  in  conclusion,  "that  my  fewbald  notes  do  not  give  much  idea  of  the  great  affection  in  which  hewas  held  by  us  all ,  nor  how  much  we  missed  him . ' 'A  few  sentences  from  Abbey's  letters  to  his  assistants  may  bequoted  here .  To  Mr .  Board :"  Don't  think  you  must  show  the  pictureif  it  is  not  as  good  as  you  can  make  it.  Don't  think  you  must  show  itjust  for  the  sake  of  showing  something!     You  should  always  havesome  sort  of  frame  to  see  your  work  in.  It  isolates  it  from  the  chairsand  wall,  etc.,  behind  it."'

What  Ithink  I  said  was,  that  so  far  as  a  man 's  art  is  concerned  the  particularform  of  his  religious  b  elief  matters  little ,  and  is ,  so  far  as  other  people377RELIGION  AND  ARTare  concerned,  of  no  importance  at  all  so  long  as  he  keeps  his  con-victions—  or  lack  of  convictions —  to  himself,  and  does  not  makehimself  a  nuisance;  although  there  are  many  sincere  people  who  areunhappy  unless  they  are  trying  to  make  other  people  see  things  asthey  do  themselves .

While  Abbeywas  staying  there  he  received  a  visit  from  Mr.  Joseph  Huston,  thearchitect  of  the  new  Capitol  at  Harrisburg,  whose  purpose  was  tointerest  the  artist  in  its  decoration.  The  building  promised  to  bea  singularly  fine  one,  and  to  a  Pennsylvanian  and  to  one  so  intentupon  perfecting  the  art  of  mural  painting,  the  prospect  was  allur-ing; but,  on  the  other  hand,  having  but  just  finished  his  great  Bostonfrieze,  Abbey  was  in  a  mood  rather  to  rest  awhile  and  consider  hisfuture  with  quiet  deliberation  than  so  quickly  bind  himself  to  an-other vast  enterprise.  In  spite,  therefore,  of  efforts  made  by  the  lateDr.  J.William  White,  of  Philadelphia,  the  surgeon  and  also  Profes-sor at  the  University  of  Pennsylvania,  and  by  the  late  John  G.  John-son, the  distinguished  Philadelphia  lawyer  and  art  collector,  Abbeywould  not  make  any  other  promise  than  that  he  would  think  uponthe  matter.  And  thus,  when  the  time  came  for  him  to  sail  for  Eng-land in  February,  was  it  left.Writing  to  his  brother  on  his  arrival  in  London  in  March  he  re-ferred to  the  matter.  "  I  am  absolutely  tired  out — slept  for  days  onthe  steamer — and  now  I  cannot  settle  to  anything  at  all.  I  hope  to,soon.  The  only  thing  I  Ve  done  is  to  sketch  out  pretty  elaboratelythe  plan  of  decoration  for  the  Harrisburg  Capitol.  This  had  to  bedone  in  a  couple  of  days — and  nights — and  inasmuch  as  the  scopeof  the  work  is  really  very  large  I  feel  that  I  piled  a  lot  of  work  into379HARRISBURG  WORK  BEGUNthe  time;  but  the  reaction  comes  and  my  head  won't  work  any  moreat  the  moment.  .  .  ."Tadema  has  been  over  here  a  couple  of  times  and  Whistler  fiveor  six  (he  has  just  gone) — Sargent,  too.  .  .  .  The  Hicks-Beachescame  too.  We've  been  lunching  with  them  to-day — at  historic1 1  Downing  Street.  Being  a  Sunday  Sir  Michael  took  us  all  overthe  Treasury  apartments  (Balfour  lives  there)  next  door.  Beauti-ful old  rooms  with  fine  portraits  and  furniture.  We  walked  acrossfrom  there  to  the  Choates."Later  he  says  that  he  has  "by  no  means  settled  to  do  the  Har-risburg  work.  .  .  .  Don't  believe  anything  you  see  about  me  in  thepapers  until  I  tell  you  it  is  true."  Another  passage  of  interest  inthe  same  letter  is  this:  "I  hope  they  won't  rush  E.  A.  A.  II.  too  hardat  Dr .  Thayer 's.  Let  him  go  in  well  for  his  languages.  I  believe  theseto  be  about  the  most  useful  weapons  a  man  can  have  in  life. "  E.A.A.the  second ,  Abbey 's  nephew,  was  then  being  educated  at  his  uncle'sexpense  at  St. Mark's  School  in  Southborough, Massachusetts.  Fif-teen years  later  the  boy  was  to  fall  in  the  War,  fighting  with  the  Brit-ish for  civilisation  long  before  America  came  in.In  a  few  months'  time,  however,  Abbey  had  so  far  made  up  hismind  about  the  Harrisburg  project  that  he  was  working  on  one  ofthe  lunettes.  Since  the  scheme  of  decoration  was,  as  we  shall  see,changed  from  time  to  time,  and  the  commission  did  not  crystal-lise until  later,  it  is  better  to  leave  the  consideration  of  the  matteruntil  a  later  chapter.  Enough  to  say  here  that  the  artist  was  to  re-ceive payment  at  a  rate  far  more  in  proportion  to  the  labour  thanhe  had  obtained  from  Boston,  his  powers  now  being  proven,  where-as he  had  come  to  the  Boston  work  a  painter  untrained.To  the  Academy  Abbey  sent  a  pen-and-ink  drawing  "Tho' Ama-ryllis dance  in  green, "  while  to  the  exhibition  of  the  Royal  Birming-ham Society  of  Artists,  of  which  he  was  President,  he  contributedhis  painting  "Crusaders  Sighting  Jerusalem"and  the  whole  seriesof  his  drawings  for  the  Comedies  of  Shakespeare,  to  the  number  ofone  hundred  and  thirty -two.  At  the  Academy  of  Arts,  Newcastle-upon-Tyne,  he  exhibited  his  water- colour  "An  Attention."3 8 0THE  PENCIL  AND  THE  PENMr.  Alden  having  suggested  that  Abbey  might  like  to  set  downfor  the  readers  of  Harper's  Magazine  some  of  his  thoughts  con-cerning the  Tragedies  and  his  theory  of  illustration,  as  an  intro-duction to  the  new  Shakespeare  series,  the  artist  replied:  "I  hopeyou  will  understand  me  when  I  say  that  a  great  many  more  thingsare  expected  of  me  than  used  to  be  the  case.  I  am  asked  to  do  allsorts  of  things — to  serve  on  committees;  to  award  prizes  at  schools;to  judge  Government  competitions;  preside  at  meetings;  be  pre-sident of  things;  and  give  advice  to  fond  parents  who  think  theirchildren  coming  Raphaels ,  etc . ,  etc . ,  etc .  All  of  these  things  I  get  outof  whenever  it  is  possible  to  do  so — as  my  work  is  more  and  morecomplicated  and  engrossing — and  when  I  do  what  /  caH'thinking'it  must  be  about  my  work .  Writing  is  not  my  work — nor  could  I  callit  my  play.  It  is  not  my  means  of  expression — and  I  have  too  muchrespect  for  the  profession  of  literature  to  try  to  enter  the  lists  withthose  who  have  a  right  to  the  space  I  should  occupy.  There  is  quiteenough  sloppy  writing  printed — without  mine  being  added  to  it."If  I  were  able  to  write  the  impressions  the  plays  of  Shakespearemake  upon  me  I  could  not  do  the  drawings.  The  drawings  fall  farshort  of  what  I  wish  they  could  be,  but  they  are  growths  from  sug-gestions in  the  text  filled  in  gradually  with  details  as  the  compositionrounds  out.  Words  don't  fill  out  the  details — things  do — architec-ture, furniture,  arms,  trees, heads,  hands,  dresses,  etc.,  etc.,  and  Ifeel  it  my  duty  as  well  as  my  pleasure  to  be  guilty  of  as  few  historicalinaccuracies  as  this  antiquarian  age  permits.  Someone,  nowadays,knows  a  piece  of  pretty  much  all  there  is  to  know — and  I  think  it  myduty  to  ransack  the  ends  of  everything  to  get  things  right  before  thepurely  artistic  work  is  under  consideration."Students  of  the  reign  of  Richard  II.  may  depend,  for  instance,upon  the  accuracy  of  the  architecture  in  the  drawing  of  Richardupon  the  walls,  of  Richard's  dress  and  armour,  of  Salisbury's  andAlbemarle's  dress  and  arms  and  heraldic  devices,  and  so  on.  Thefloating  idea  is  a  simple  thing — that  'comes.'  But  the  endless  oddsand  ends  that  go  to  make  up  a  conscientious,  worth-doing  picturetake  time  and  patience — and  nine-tenths  of  every  picture  is  madeVOL.  n. —i  381THE  DESERTED  VILLAGEup  of  these  details — which  are  wrong  if  they  are  not  right.  WhileI  am  waiting  to  discover  the  details  of  one  design  numerous  otherdesigns  will  have  suggested  themselves,  or  some  details  or  move-ment I  may  have  been  groping  for,  for  a  year,  may  appear  out  of  themist.  For  this  reason  I  keep  things  by  me  for  a  long  time.  I  have  atleast  twenty  pictures  large  and  larger  begun — six  or  seven  in  moreor  less  active  progress  all  the  time — besides  all  these  Shakespearedrawings.  So,  when  I  am  down  here  in  the  country  I  am  uninter-ruptedly working  out  all  these  various  sorts  of  things,  and  even  if  Ihad  time  to  sit  down  and  write — which  I  haven't — I  couldn't  do  it.These  unfinished  designs  are  floating  before  me  all  the  time — oneor  another.  A  hurried  letter  to  a  friend  is,  of  course,  to  be  writtenonce  in  a  way — and  I  know  these  will  not  criticise  faults  of  style,  orat  least  I  hope  they  don't.  And,  too,  I  think  you  must  agree  that,  ifan  artist's  works  have  failed  to  express  his  feelings, they  fail  of  theirplace  in  the  world.  It  is  a  confession  of  weakness,  in  my  opinion,  ifhe  supplements  them  by  writing — or  wearing  long  hair  or  velveteenjackets."In  Harper's  Magazine  in  this  year  (1902)  Abbey  was  representedby  the  beautiful  Deserted  Village  drawings  which  he  had  been  con-sidering and  reconsidering  and  perfecting  for  so  long  a  time,  andwhich  now  ran  through  three  numbers,  and  at  the  end  of  the  year,with  a  preface  by  Mr .  Dobson,  were  issued  in  book  form.  The  pub-lished volume,  however,  was  a  bitter  disappointment  to  the  artist.From  it  he  had  expected  much,  and  it  fell  far  short  of  his  ideal.  Thefollowing  passage  from  a  letter  of  remonstrance  sent  by  him  to  thepublishers — not  with  any  undue  haste — indicates  the  state  of  hisfeelings,  and  again  proves  with  what  a  solicitous  and  paternal  eyehe  viewed  his  creations.  The  date  is  March  i9th,  1903 :  "I  must  notdefer  longer  in  putting  in  my  protest  about  the  way  you  are  treatingmy  work .  The  get-up  and  arrangement  of  The  Deserted  Village  bookwere  a  shock  and  a  bitter  disappointment  to  me.  I  left  all  this  to  youat  Franklin  Square  because  Mr .  Anthony  had  done  the  ShakespeareComedy  books  so  beautifully  that  I  felt  The  Deserted  Village  couldnot  be  in  better  hands,  especially  as  I  had  talked  it  all  over  some  years3 8 2©  U»'TWO  PROTESTSago  at  Franklin  Square,  and  had  left  there  one  of  the  early  editions  ofthe  poem,  which  was  beautifully  printed,  and  upon  the  make-up  ofwhich  I  took  it  for  granted  that  my  book  was  to  be  modelled."I  never  dreamed  that  you  intended  to  put  forth  the  cheap  andvulgar  edition  that  you  have  published,  in  type  that  is  simply  bar-barous, with  a  cover  that  is  an  eyesore,  and  paper  to  match — and  thisbefore  a  fine  edition  was  done.  The  pictures  were  far  better  printedin  the  Magazine  than  they  were  in  the  book ."Moreover,  I  ought  to  have  been  consulted  before  you  placed  myportrait  in  the  book  as  a  frontispiece.  It  was  surely  out  of  key  withthe  whole  thing,  and  to  me  altogether  obj  ectionable."I  earnestly  hope  that  you  have  printed  but  a  small  edition  andthat  you  have  it  in  mind  to  do  me  justice  in  a  better  book — an  editiongot  up  in  a  way  that  would  prove  to  your  public  and  mine  that  youhave  at  least  some  respect  for  my  work."It  was  always  Abbey's  intention  to  take  advantage  of  a  clause  inhis  agreement  with  Messrs.  Harpers  for  The  Deserted  Village,  en-titling him  to  issue  the  drawings  himself  in  an  enlarged  size  and  forthis  purpose  to  use  photogravure  plates  of  a  number  of  them,  madein  Paris  by  Dujardin,  but  the  project  has  not  yet  been  carried  out.Having  finished  with  the  shortcomings  of  The  Deserted  Village  inbook  form,  Abbey,  in  the  same  letter  to  his  publishers,  turned  toanother  source  of  disapprobation:  "Now,  as  to  the  coloured  platesof  my  Shakespearean  drawings  in  the  Magazine,  I  must  ask  you  notto  print  any  more  in  colour.  Those  that  you  have  done  are  a  libelupon  my  work.  I  have  not  seen  one  print  where  the  register  is  true.I  have  taken  enormous  pains  with  these  designs,  and  no  money  canrepay  me  for  the  way  the  Magazine  presents  them .  In  the '  RichardII .'  figure  the  register  is  so  untrue  that  even  Richard's  eyes  are  madeto  come  in  the  wrong  place,  so  that  the  whole  thing  becomes  a  carica-ture. I  have  begun  several  drawings  in  colour  for  other  plays,  but,since  you  are  unable  to  produce  them  properly,  it  is  best  to  do  themin  simple  black-and-white.  .  .  ."The  Deserted  Village  was  not  the  only  publication  that  troubledAbbey  in  1902.  No  man,  as  the  reader  must  by  now  be  aware,  had383THE  HUBBARD  PAMPHLETless  tendency  to  advertisement  than  he;  nor  had  he  an  exaggeratedview  of  his  own  ability  and  achievement.  He  believed  in  himself  andhe  liked  recognition;  but  the  recognition  had  to  be  well-founded.No  one  could  be  more  fond  of  the  truth  than  he— the  simpler  andmore  direct  the  better.  Hence  we  may  conceive  something  of  thedepth  of  his  resentment  when  in  November,  1902,  there  was  pub-lished in  America  a  pamphlet  which  claimed  to  be  an  accurate  de-scription of  the  artist  and  his  Gloucestershire  home,  but  which,written  by  a  man  who  had  never  seen  either  Abbey  or  Fairford,  waspacked  with  falsities .  The  author  was  the  late  Elbert  Hubbard ,  whowas  drowned  in  the  Lusitania,  and  the  publication  belonged  to  aseries  entitled  Little  Journeys  to  the  Homes  of  Eminent  Artists,  theprevious  subj  ects  having  been  Raphael ,  Leonardo ,  Botticelli ,  Thor-waldsen,  Gainsborough,  Velasquez,  Corot,  Correggio,  GiovanniBellini,  and  Cellini.The  discerning  reader  of  Hubbard 's  remarks  on  Abbey  wouldquickly  realise  that  herewasabrickmaker  lacking  straw,  an  oppor-tunist distracting  attention  from  his  ignorance  by  digression  andjest;  but  too  few  readers  are  discerning,  most  of  us  allowing  theprinted  word  to  exercise  such  a  magnetic  influence  over  us  thateven  after  the  thousand-and-first  disillusionment  we  still  believeit  true.  No  wonder,  then,  that  Abbey,  finding  himself  mishandledand  frankly  romanced  about  on  every  page,  was  angry.  He  suc-ceeded in  preventing  the  pamphlet 's  inclusion  in  the  volume  whichMessrs.  Putnam  afterwards  issued,  but  since  copies  of  it  are  still  inexistence,  and  often  are  quoted  from,  it  will  be  well  to  illustrate  itsgross  inaccuracies  by  quoting  a  few  of  the  comments  which  Abbeywrote  on  the  margins.  It  begins  thus:"Edwin  A.  Abbey  was  born  in  Philadelphia  (not  of  his  own  choos-ing) in  the  year  1852.  His  parents  were  blessed  in  that  they  hadneither  poverty  nor  riches.  Their  ambition  for  Edwin  was  that  heshould  enter  one  of  the  so-called  learned  professions;  but  this  wasnot  to  the  boy's  taste.  I  fear  me  he  was  a  heretic  through  pre-natalinfluences,  for  they  do  say  that  he  was  a  child  of  his  mother.  Thismother's  mind  was  tinted  with  her  Quaker  associations  until  she.384GEORGE  W.  CHILDSdoubted  the  five  points  of  Calvinism  and  had  small  faith  in  theForty-nine  Articles."Against  this  Abbey  set  the  following  statement:  "My  mother  wasnever  a  Quaker,  nor  had  she  any  Quaker  relatives.  There  is  not  aword  referring  to  her  in  this  and  the  following  pages  which  in  anyparticular  describes  her  or  her  methods.  My  parents  never  intendedor  suggested  that  I  should  become  a  doctor  or  a  lawyer.  They  hopedat  one  time  that  I  might  enter  the  Church  (Episcopal) .  I  was  broughtup  in  the  Episcopal  Church,  of  which  my  parents  were  members."Hubbard  went  onpleasantly  to  say  that  the  artist  as  a  child  squint-ed, was  beetle-browed  and  bow-legged;  also  that  while  still  in  frockshe  cut  the  pictures  from  Harper's  Weekly  (which  had  not  then  comeinto  existence).  Further  that  he  was  placed  by  a  friend  in  the  type-setting department  of  the  Philadelphia  Ledger,  of  which  his  friendand  patron  George  W.  Childs  was  owner,  and  that  it  was  Childswho  recommended  him  to  the  Art  Department  of  Harper's  Weekly.Hubbard  adds:  "That  George  W.  Childs  had  a  really  firm  friend-ship for  Abbey  there  is  no  doubt .  He  followed  his  career  with  father-ly interest  and  was  the  first  man  who  had  the  prophetic  vision  to  seethat  he  would  become  a  great  artist. ' 'Against  this  Abbey  wrote:  "I  never  set  type  nor  had  any  connec-tion with  newspaper  work.  I  never  spoke  to  George  W.  Childs  inmy  life.  I  never  saw  him  but  once.  I  have  no  reason  to  suppose  heever  heard  of  me.  My  people  did  not  know  him,  nor  had  he  any  con-nection in  any  way  with  my  life."Hubbard  continued:  "The  pet  aversion  of  Childs  was  tobacco.All  through  the  Ledger  office  were  startling  signs  'No  Smoking'whether  the  use  of  tobacco  had  anything  to  do  with  young  Abbey'sbreaking  with  his  Ledger  friends  is  a  question.  Tradition  has  it  thatChilds  extracted  from  the  youth  a  promise  on  his  going  away  thathe  would  never  use  the  weed.  The  Union  Square  records  fail  us  attimes,  but  it  is  believed  that  Abbey  kept  his  promise  for  fully  threeweeks."This  is  Abbey 's  comment: "  I  never  smoked  in  my  life,  nor  wantedto."385A  FALSE  GUIDEHubbard  continues:  "At  Harpers'  Abbey  came  into  competitionwith  strong  men.  In  the  office  was  a  young  fellow  by  the  name  ofReinhart,  and  another  by  the  name  of  Alexander.  .  .  .  A  little  latercame  Howard  Pyle,  Joseph  Fennel  [sic]  and  Alfred  Parsons  ----  Fora  time  he  drew  just  like  Alexander,  then  like  Reinhart,  next  Parsonswas  his  mentor."-  -The  foregoing  passage  deserves  particular  no-tice and  refutation  ,  becauseHubbard  's  pamphlet  seems  still  to  serveas  an  authority  for  other  writers  .  The  artist's  commentary  runs  thus:4  'John  Alexander,  who  is  five  years  younger  than  I  am  ,  came  to  Har-pers'asaboyfiveyears  after  I  began  there.  Neither  HowardPyle  norJoseph  Pennell  nor  Alfred  Parsons  was  ever  at  Harpers'.  '  '  None  theless,  in  the  Encyclopaedia  Britannica  (eleventh  and  latest  edition),which  seems  to  have  made  Hubbard  's  pamphlet  its  source  of  infor-mation, it  is  stated  that  Abbey  was  at  Harpers'  in  the  company  of"suchmenasHowardPyle.  .  .Joseph  Pennell,  and  Alfred  Parsons";while  in  a  book  published  in  1  9  1  6  by  Mr  .  J  .Walker  McSpadden,  en-Abbey  places  him  as  a  printer's  devil  in  the  Public  Ledger  office,  givesG.  W.  Childs  the  credit  of  acting  as  his  inspired  patron,  and  sendsthe  youth  to  Harpers  'to  associate  with  and  be  stimulated  by  "JosephPennell,  Howard  Pyle  ,  and  Alfred  Parsons  .  '  '  Mr  .McSpadden,  how-ever, it  must  be  admitted,  when  narrating  these  matters,  lays  noclaim  to  any  of  the  toil  of  original  research,  but  frankly  confesses  hisobligations  to  Hubbard  's  Little  Journeys.  But  elsewhere  in  his  ar-ticle he  reaches  heights  of  his  own  scaling,  as  when  he  begins  hissummary  of  the  career  of  one  who  remained  an  American  citizen—"Mr.  "Abbey  and  only  "Mr.  "Abbey—  to  the  end:  "From  a  printer's'devil'  ...  to  a  knighthood  from  the  King  is  surely  a  long  step."Hubbard  again:  "Abbey  and  Parsons  had  walked  to  Philadelphia[to  visit  the  Centennial  Exhibition]  and  back,  taking  two  weeks  forthe  trip  ,  sketching  on  the  way  stage-coaches,  taverns,  tall  houses  andold  wooden  bridges  all  pinned  together  —  just  these  and  nothingelse,  save  Independence  Hall.*  Later  they  went  to  Boston  and  didMr.  McSpadden,  however,  knows  better.  According  to  him  they  sketched  "  everypicturesque  bit  in  sight  —  stage-coaches,  stiles,  barnyards,  rustic  bridges,  and  what-not."What  not,  indeed  ?3 8 6MANY  INVENTIONSFaneuil  Hall,  inside  and  out,  King's  Chapel,  and  the  State  House,and  a  house  or  two  out  Quincy  way,  including  the  Adams  cottagewhere  lived  two  presidents,  and  where  now  resides  one,  WilliamQueer,  the  only  honorary  male  member  of  the  Daughters  of  the  Re-volution. Mr.  Queer  dominates  the  artistic  bailiwick  and  performsantique  antics  for  art's  sake:  it  was  Mr.  Queer  who  posed  as  TonyLumpkin  for  Mr.  Abbey."Here  are  Abbey's  corrections:  "I  went  from  New  York  to  theCentennial  Exhibition,  1875,  by  train  anc^  alone.  I  never  went  on  awalking  expedition  in  my  life.  Alfred  Parsons  is  an  Englishman.He  was  never  in  America  until  1 882 .  I  never  saw  him  or  any  of  hiswork  nor  heard  of  him  until  1879  after  I  came  to  England.  I  was  inBoston  for  just  half  a  day  in  1 877.  .  .  .  I  never  sketched  Faneuil  Hallor  King's  Chapel  or  the  State  House.  I  have  never  been  to  Quincynor  seen  the  Adams  cottage  nor  heard  of  William  Queer.  My  modelfor  Tony  Lumpkin  was  a  professional  model  in  London,  where  Imade  the  drawings  for  She  Stoops  to  Conquer."Hubbard  again:  "Abbey  had  done  Washington  Irving' 's  Knicker-bocker Tales    He  worked  exclusively  in  black-and-white    Hethirsted  to  refresh  his  imagination  in  England    A  de  luxe  edition.  .  andof  'Herrick'  was  proposed  by  the  Publishing  Department  ..  .

Parsons  was  going  to  the  dock  to  see  himoff.  'I  wish  you  were  going  too,'  said  Edwin  huskily.  'I  believe  Iwill,'  said  Alfred,  swallowing  hard.  And  he  did.  .  This  was  in  1878.  .."London  held  them  only  a  few  days  and  then  they  started  forStratford    They  went  on  foot    They  took  the  road  for  Oxford..  .

I  became  a  member  of  the  American  Water-Colour  Societyin  1875  or  1876.  I,  therefore,  did  network  exclusively  in  black-and-white.  The  Herrick  book  was  my  own  proposition.  I  ceased  to  havea  salary  in  1876,  so  that  a  salary  did  not  enter  into  the  question  in1878.  All  upon  this  page  is  utter  nonsense.  I  was  to  see  Alfred  Par-sons for  the  first  time  in  1 879  in  London' '  I  did  not  go  afoot  to  Stratford .  I  went  alone  by  train  from  Liver-pool, and  I  went  because  I  was  to  illustrate  an  article  by  Wm.  Win-ter. I  did  not  stop  at  Oxford  or  Warwick,  nor  did  I  see  Oxford  orWarwick  until  several  years  later"I  never  saw  Broad  way  until  seven  years  later.  I  never  had  a  housethere  with  Alfred  Parsons  ! !  ..."I  never  was  at  Bordentown  in  my  life,  and  I  never  knew  anyonewho  came  from  there  except  Richard  Watson  Gilder."As  Hubbard  proceeded  he  grew  more  reckless.  The  title  of  hisfantastic  series  was,  we  remember,  Little  Journeys  to  the  Homes  ofEminent  Artists,  and  his  effort  to  adhere  to  it  landed  him  in  evengreater  errors.  Morgan  Hall  is  "old,  vine-clad,  built  in  sections  run-ning over  a  space  of  three  hundred  years.  .  .  .There  is  a  goodly  broodof  little  Abbeys — I  dare  not  say  how  many.  I  believe  itwas  nine  ayear  ago,  with  an  addition  since.  They  run  wild  and  free  along  thehedgerows  and  under  the  beeches."  And  in  this  paragraph  camealso  a  reference  to  Mrs.  Abbey,  her  husband's  comments  uponwhich  have  already  been  printed  in  Chapter  XXII.The  Abbeys  were  childless.The  publication  of  such  a  tissue  of  falsities  could  not  but  causeannoyance,  but  Abbey  at  first  did  no  more  than  ask  his  old  friendWilliam  Laffan  to  do  what  he  could  to  discredit  Hubbard 's  impu-dent inventions.  In  a  letter  of  December  9, 1902,  he  says:  "I  gettired  of  seeing  statements  about  myself  made  out  of  whole  cloth,and  am  often  tempted  to  write  protests.  I  usually  refrain — butthere  has  been  sent  me  within  a  day  or  two  a  small  book  (price  25cents),  which  is  really  more  than  I  know  how  to  stand.  It  is  issuedby  the  Roy  croft  Press,  and  is  one  of  a  series  of  pamphlets  entitled3 8 8PROPOSED  REPRINTLittle  Journeys  to  the  Homes  of  Eminent  Artists.— ABBE  Y.  The  ad-vertisement says  that  these  pamphlets  circulate  as  text-books  inthousands  of  schools,  etc.,  and  that  the  circulation  is  60,000.  Thismay  be  no  truer  than  the  contents  of  the  pamphlet,  which  is  anoffensive  misstatement  of  facts  from  beginning  to  end.  What  en-rages me  is  what  is  said  about  my  poor  dear  mother — and  aboutGertrude.  .  .  .  This  little  book  is  absolutely  outrageous — in  sucha  way  that  it  is  hard  to  get  hold  of  it."Laffan  apparently  was  unable  to  do  anything,  for  the  circulationof  the  pamphlet  continued,  and,  as  we  have  seen,  it  became  the  text-book for  the  indolent  and  the  hasty.  Abbey,  himself,  did  his  best  toforget  it.  But  some  years  later  the  whole  matter  was  reopened  in  thefollowing letterto  Abbey  fromMr.G.H.Putnam,who  had  acquiredthe  rights  in  certain  Roy  croft  Press  publications,  and,  wishing  for  anew  photograph  of  Abbey  to  accompany  the  reprint,  wrote  to  himfor  that  purpose,  referring  to  Hubbard's  "critical  and  biographicalsketch  of  yourself,  with  an  estimate  (a  deservedly  favourable  esti-mate) of  the  present  interests  and  permanent  value  of  your  work. ' 'To  this  Abbey  replied  that  he  had  every  objection  to  the  publica-tion of  the  "critical  and  biographical' 'sketch  in  question,  and  givinghis  very  sound  reasons  why  the  thing  should  rather  be  burned  thanreissued.  "I  am  glad,"  he  wrote,  "to  know  on  my  own  account  thatyou  have  bought  the  pamphlet  purporting  to  be  a  biography  ofmyself,  because  you  could  not  possibly  publish,  as  a  member  of  anold  and  highly  respected  firm,  as  well  as  for  every  other  reason  thatappeals  to  a  gentleman,  anything  so  highly  offensive  to  the  subjectof  the  memoir."  He  also  said:  "I  consulted  several  eminent  Ameri-can lawyers  as  to  the  possibility  of  legal  redress .  In  the  present  stateof  the  libel  laws  in  the  United  States  I  learned  that  no  redress  waspossible  and  I  was  advised  to  let  the  matter  drop  and  to  allow  thepamphlet  to  die  a  natural  death."Abbey's  wishes  were  ultimately  respected;  but  from  what  oddangles  it  is  possible  to  view  such  levity, when  one  is  not  its  victim,the  following  passage  from  Mr.  Putnam 's  Memories  of  a  Publisher,1915,  will  show:  "I  brought  pressure  to  bear  upon  Hubbard  and389A  SUCCESSFUL  PROTESTsecured  the  cancellation  of  the  chapter  in  the  proposed  book.  Headmitted ,  of  course,  that  he  had  never  made  the  visit  and  had  in  factnever  seen  Abbey.  He  had  secured  some  description  of  Abbey'scountry  home,  and  he  thought  that  the  beautiful  English  lawnwould  look  'kind  of  empty'  without  children,  and  therefore  he  hadput  the  children  into  his  picture.  'A  man  ought  not  to  get  annoyed,'said  Hubbard,  'at  a  little  thing  like  that,  particularly  when  I  tooksuch  pains  to  crack  up  his  art."ACHAPTER  XXXVIIITHE  HARRISBURG   COMMISSION  AND    COM-PLETION OF  "THE  CORONATION"1903-1904    Aged  50-52Tadema  in  Egypt — Remonstrance  to  Boston — Deathof  Walter  Osborne — McKim'sEnglish  Honour — Whistler's  Death — Art  as  a  Livelihood — A  Visit  to  Cambridge —Signs  of  Strain — The  Harrisburg  Contracts — The  Coronation  Picture — The  RoyalExchange  PanelBY  the  end  of  1 902  Abbey  had  begun  seriously  upon  his  Harris-burg  designs,  although  the  commission  was  not  definitely  ac-cepted until  some  months  later.  This  task,  which  was  chieflyto  occupy  his  hand  and  mind  from  now  onward,  becamemore  and  more  exacting  as  it  advanced ,  since  he  was  not  only  hard  toplease  but  continually  learning;  and  his  labours  were  consequentlysevere.   The  first  letter  of  1903 ,  in  January,  says:  "The  Coronationcanvas  is  getting  covered  with  personages —  none  of  whom  haveheads  yet    The  crucifix  is  nearing  completion —  and  I  have  donealotofShakespearedrawings.  ThepaintingfortheRoyalExchangeis  well  along,  too — and  so  is  the  'Dance'  canvas."Among  Abbey's  correspondents  none  was  more  frequent  thanTadema;  but  it  is  seldom  that  I  find  in  his  letters  anything  that  seemsto  call  for  quotation.  In  January,  1903,  however,  when  he  was  inEgypt  as  a  guest  of  Sir  John  Aird,  to  make  studies  for  his  picture  of'The  Finding  of  Moses,"  which  Aird  had  commissioned,  he  sentAbbey  an  amusing  account  of  his  travels.  "Egypt  is  funny.  Thefirst  impression  of  the  people,  at  least  for  a  day  or  two ,  was  that  I  feltlike  in  Beerbohm  Tree's  theatre,  and  that  they  were  all  the  supers  ofone  of  his  Oriental  plays,  say  Herod.  It  was  too  funny,  and  it  wasfunny  never  to  see  a  woman  in  the  streets  of  Cairo — all  men — andthen  those  magenta  sunsets,  so  queer,  so  absurd.  I  never  got  accus-tomed to  it.  And  the  blacker  the  people  the  more  black  they  wore.I  saw  on  the  reservoir  two  boats  full  of  Soudanese,  all  dressed  inblack,  and  their  faces  were  that  black  that  their  clothes  looked  grey193A  PLEA  FOR  MYSTERYand  they  must  have  been  blackleaded  afresh  that  very  morningThat  inauguration  on  the  loth  won't  be  soon  forgotten  by  me.Fancy  standing  in  the  broiling  sun  in  a  chimney-pot  and  black  frockcoat  for  a  few  hours;  it  is  enough  to  play  the  deuce  with  my  system.Assuan  was  all  bunting,  and  seeing  it  from  the  other  side  of  the  Nile,with  all  the  red  flags  in  sunshine  and  transparency,  looked  like  ahuge  poppy  field.  It  was  so  cheery.  The  white  dome  and  minaret  ofthe  mosque  did  well  with  the  red  of  the  flags,  and  when  it  all  wasilluminated  the  Qth  and  loth,  when  the  Khedive  was  there,  it  wassimply  delightful."On  February  lyth  Abbey  wrote  as  follows  to  Mr. Thomas  A.  Fox,who  had  been  concerned  with  the  installation  of  the  "Holy  Grail"paintings  in  the  Boston  Public  Library  in  the  previous  year: "  Say—I  hear  dire  things  about  footlights  being  placed  around  the  fore-ground of  my  frieze.  For  goodness'  sake ! !  !  can't  this  be  stopped?My  idea  of  the  decorative  painting  of  a  room  is  that  it  should  abideby  the  conditions  of  light  obtaining  in  the  room  decorated.  As  Ihave  been  repeatedly  told,  the  library  is  not  an  art  gallery — I  neverexpected  that  it  would  be — and  the  light  in  the  Delivery  Room  isjust  what  I  should  prefer  it  should  be.  It  is  what  I  understood  it  wasto  be  before  I  began  the  painting,  and  when  I  left  it — with  the  ex-ception of  the  chairs  and  some  of  the  other  furniture —  it  all  lookedabout  as  right  as  I  knew  how  to  make  it.  Now  if  it  is  vulgarised  andcheapened  by  rows  of  electric  footlights  I  shall  be  disgusted  anddisheartened  —  and  I  wish  to  protest  with  all  the  force  I  can  againstsuch  nonsense.  If  some  of  the  work  is  more  or  less  in  the  dark,  thatdoesn't  hurt  it.  It  is  intended  to  be  in  the  dark.  Let  us  have  a  littlemystery  about.  We  know  what  is  there  even  if  we  don't  see  it  all:  Iam  sure  you  wear  socks  in  winter  although  I  have  never  seen  them.As  to  the  chairs —  I  think  you  would  have  found  the  small  ones  verystrong  indeed .  I  have  had  one  like  it  in  hard  use  for  fifteen  years."You  know  that  chairs  were  a  luxury  and  were  very  few  in  theearly  sixteenth  century.  People  sat  on  forms  or  on  benches  roundthe  room  against  the  wall —  part  of  the  room — which  is  where  theyought  to  sit  in  the  Delivery  Room.  Why  they  don't  I  don't  know.

How  I  should  enjoy  that!  Ifear,however,thatlshallbetheslave  of  the  high  and  mighty  for  some  time.  I  am  knocking  off  peers[in  the  Coronation  picture]  at  the  rate  of  six  or  eight  per  diem"A  day  or  so  later  came  an  invitation  from  the  P.R.A.to  serve  on  asub-committee  to  consider  the  Fine  Arts  exhibit  at  the  St.  LouisExhibition,  which  Abbey  accepted.  In  April  he  was  in  Paris  to  setup  full-sized  oil  sketches  of  the  reredos  in  place  before  beginning  onthe  wooden  panels ,  returning  to  London  in  time  for  Varnishing  Day ;but  he  did  not,  for  a  melancholy  reason,  play  in  the  usual  VarnishingDay  cricket  match,  Walter  Osborne,  perhaps  the  most  generally  be-loved of  all  the  artist-cricketers,  having  just  succumbed  to  doublepneumonia.  Writing  to  Mr.  Swinstead  Abbey  says:  "It  wouldn't  doto  stop  next  Wednesday's  match,  but  I  won't  go  to  it,  I  think.  Itwould  be  a  pity  to  disappoint  a  good  many —  but  they  didn't  knowhim  so  well,  and  can't  feel  about  it  as  I  do — so  the  match  itself  mightgo  on,  but  I  couldn't  get  up  any  heart  in  it."Abbey  was  represented  in  the  Academy  this  year  by  his  picture"Pot-Pourri,"  begun  in  1892  after  his  return  from  Rothenburg,where  he  had  made  the  study  of  the  white  room,  and  he  used  thisstudy  as  a  setting  for  the  picture.  In  1899  this  painting  was  finishedfor  the  late  Mr.  William  Vivian,  of  Queen's  Gate,  London,  and  hadnow  been  lent  by  him  for  exhibition.  An  event  of  the  early  summer,spent  chiefly  in  the  Tite  Street  studio  on  Coronation  sitters,  al-though Abbey  found  time  to  give  OnslowFord  sittings  for  a  bust  ofhimself,  was  a  dinner  at  Chelsea  Lodge  to  McKim,  in  honour  of  hisreceipt  of  the  Gold  Medal  of  the  Royal  Institute  of  British  Archi-tects. To  meet  his  distinguished  fellow-countryman  and  colleaguein  the  Boston  and  other  enterprises  Abbey  invited  various  repre-sentatives of  the  Arts — Sir  Aston  Webb,  President  of  the  Royal  In-stitute of  British  Architects  and  now  P.R.A.;the  thenP.R.A.,  SirEdward  Poynter;  Lord  Carlisle,  a  trustee  of  the  National  Gallery;393C.

Swinstead,  101,  and  Henry  Ford,  64.On  July  lyth  Whistler  died.  Abbey,  who  was  one  of  his  pall-bearers, wrote  thus  to  Walter  James:  "Poor  old  Whistler's  death  hascome  finally  as  a  shock.  Somehow  I  thought  to  see  him  among  usfor  a  long  time  still .  Few  men  have  made  so  great  a  mark  upon  theirtime  and  few  men  have  left  their  work  so  complete.  He  taught  mento  see  something  very  subtle  that  he  saw.  He  painted  completelywhat  he  wished  to  show  them,  and  left  no  loose  ends  behind  him3 9 6s^THE  DEATH  OF  WHISTLERfor  others  to  perfect.  I  think  very  few  artists  have  done  that.  Somehave — but  mighty  few."Whistler  in  his  last  years,  and  especially  after  he  came  again  tolive  in  Chelsea,  was  much  at  Chelsea  Lodge,  dining  there  frequentlyand  very  often  spending  nearly  the  whole  of  Sunday  there.  Comingin  the  morning,  he  would  return  to  the  studio  after  lunch,  where,sitting  in  a  comfortable  chair,  in  course  of  time  he  would  fall  asleep,and,  after  a  nap ,  awakened,  perhaps,  by  the  arrival  of  guests  and  tea,would  linger  on  until  dinner,  which  a  little  persuasion  induced  himto  share.  During  the  months  spent  in  London,  Abbey  saw  as  muchas  possible  of  his  friends  and  acquaintances,  and  Whistler  came  notonly  to  formal  dinners,  but  of  ten  to  impromptu  dinners  arrangedfor  American  friends  passing  unexpectedly  through  London.  Onone  of  these  occasions,  when  Mark  Twain  was  present,  the  partysat  talking  in  the  studio  till  dawn.From  a  long  letter  in  August  to  a  friend ,  who  wondered  if  it  mightnot  be  his  duty  to  exchange  the  pursuit  of  art  for  a  political  career,a  few  interesting  passages  are  quoted.  "For  many  years,"  Abbeywrites,  "I  have  been  trying  to  settle  (for  myself)  what  particularcombination  of  circumstances  it  is  that  makes  a  man  an  artist.  Ofcourse,  he  must  be  born  one,  and ,  curiously ,  he  is — more  often  thannot — born  incircumstancesandsurroundings  calculated, onewouldthink,  to  develop  anything  but  an  artistic  bent —  that  is,  he  comesoftener  than  not  from  plain,  prosy  and  often  poor  middle-class  peo-ple. I  don't  know  whether  a  talent  born  in  a  higher  sphere  of  lifeis  less  recognised — whether  a  boy  of  the  upper  classes  is  seriouslydiscouraged  from  folio  wing  with  all  his  energies  a  profession  whichis  rather  more  exciting  than  any  other.  I  have  at  times  thought  thatthis  might  be  the  case.  At  any  rate  few  of  the  artists  whom  I  knowwho  are  of  what  is  called  the  upper  class  seem  prepared  to  go  infor  the  thing  for  all  it  is  worth — to  go  at  it  night  and  day  for  all  thereis  in  it.  And  in  this  particular  profession  sacrifices  of  all  sortsof  things — people,  time,  inclination  and  duties  of  other  sorts  andkinds,  must  give  way  if  any  satisfaction,  any  'fun'  that  is,  is  to  be  gotout  of  itVOL.  ii  .—K  397ART  AND  STATESMANSHIP"It  seems  to  me  that  when  an  artist  has  had  a  refined  upbringing,he  has,  as  a  rule,  been  able  to  superimpose  the  study  of  art  upon  afoundation  that  carries  him  much  farther  than  that  man  gets  whohas  not.  There  are  notorious  instances  to  the  contrary,  I  know,  andit  may  be  that  men,  like  Turner  and  Morland,  say,  have  inclinedthose  who  don't  know  much  about  it  to  take  the  view  I  speak  ofYou  have  given  us  an  inkling  of  what  we  might  expect  if  you  were  toput  your  back  into  it —  and,  too,  I  believe  you  would  have  a  greatpersonal  influence  in  the  world  of  art  and  in  art  matters  generally—and  if  you  are  ambitious  in  that  way  (as  you  are  not,  I  should  say)when  the  time  comes — you  can  be  of  enormous  use  to  the  countryin  the  Upper  House.  There  are  barristers  and  financiers  and  agri-culturists and  brewers  by  the  dozen  in  that  House,  but  not  one  manwhospeakswith  any  authority  upon  matters  of  taste  and  of  art.  Andthe  better  artist  you  are,  the  greater  weight  your  words  and  opinionswill  have.  And  as  the  date  of  your  succession  in  the  course  of  thingsis ,  I  am  very  glad  to  think,  remote— you  have  lots  of  time  b  ef ore  you ,and  if  you  really  care  to,  can  go  a  long  way  still —  but  if  you  stick  atit  you  must  do  it  better.  You  must  go  deeper,  you  must  seek  theadvice  of  those  whose  work  is  sympathetic,  and  who  are  able  to  giveyou  scientific  criticism  and  advice —  Rene  Menard  for  instance—and  men  of  that  stamp.

On  theother  hand,  if  you  don't  feel  this  thing  driving  within  you —  if  theParliamentary  life  has  allurements — you  had  better  not  play  at  this.I,  of  course,  don't  know  anything  of  the  requirements  owners  ofestates  must  possess.  It  may  be  that  they  work  harder  over  theirmanagement  than  I  have  been  able  to  perceive.  It  strikes  me  thatthe  great  majority  of  owners  have  a  good  deal  of  time  for  play,  andleave  a  good  deal  of  the  duty  of  looking  after  their  property  to  agents—some  don't  of  course.'

"I  of  ten  think  how  muchbetter  employed  some  of  these  chaps  would  be  if  they  were  to  try  toovercome  their  own  shortcomings  instead  of  pointing  out  the  short-comings of  others.

They  are  rather  silent  upon  this  point,and,  seriously,  I  think  they  have  done  a  great  deal  of  damage  to  artas  such — with  a  big  A  or  a  little  one.

To  suggest  that  we  are  dis-honest is,  however,  well  worthy  the  people  who  say  so."Writing  to  Mr.Swinstead  in  the  spring  Abbey  had  complainedof  feeling  old  (he  was  fifty-one  in  April),  and  again  in  a  letter  to  Dr.White  in  September  he  had  said : "  I  get  much  more  tired  than  I  usedto,  I  think — and  it  is  more  of  an  effort  to  keep  up  to  concert  pitch"—signs  that  the  strain  of  the  intense  and  constant  mental  and  bodilyenergy  and  purpose  of  the  painter  was  beginning  to  tell.  He  says  asmuch  in  a  letter  to  his  brother-in-law  on  December  8th.  "I  am  veryhard  at  it  and  feel  the  strain  of  it  nowadays —  so  many  things  thatought  to  be  finished  and  can't  get  finished,  somehow,  although  Iwork  until  six  o'clock  most  nights —  and  am  always  at  it  by  9. 30I  am  sure  that  at  this  game  physical  strength  goes  a  long  way."An  unfinished  and  unposted  letter  to  his  brother,  written  on  thefollowing  day  and  found  among  Abbey's  papers, tells  more.  "I  havehad  a  laborious  year  of  it —  and  feel  the  fag  of  it  rather.  I  am  moreand  more  convinced  that  great  physical  strength  is  absolutely  es-4 0 0ART  AND  PHYSICAL  STRENGTHsential  to  any  success  in  art.  Those  who  get  anywhere  at  all — whodon't  fall  by  the  way — I  have  noticed  that  this  gift  is  theirs.  Hardand  incessant  study ,  combined  with  a  particularly  nerve-trying  sortof  labour —  unless  one  is  very  strong  one  can't  stand  it.  I  am  notspeaking  of  idlers — men  who  play  at  it —  but  workers,  like  Sargent,for  instance,  who  has  had  to  ease  up.  I've  met  nearly  all  the  greatartists  of  my  time  and  many  of  the  lesser  ones — but  the  big  ones  arealways  strong  men.  Women  who  stick  at  it  always  become  wrecks—I  have  never  known  it  otherwise.  In  other  arts  one  can  sit  com-fortably and  dictate —  or,  as  in  music,  interpret  what  others,  whodon't  execute,  have  written,  or  act  what  others  contrive.  At  thisgame  you  are  using  every  faculty  you  have  at  once — mind  and  nervesand  body."-  -This  phase  of  weariness  through  which  the  artist  waspassing  was,  however,  only  temporary.  He  completely  recoveredhis  strength  and  buoyancy.The  letter  to  William  Abbey  goes  on  to  sum  up  the  year's  work:"I  have  nearly  finished  the  Coronation,  glory  be! — and  am  well  onwith  Harrisburg  and  Dr.  Morgan's  reredos —  also  a  picture  ["AMeasure"]  now  on  its  third  canvas  for  Mr.  Taylor  in  New  York.  Isuppose  I  can't  call  the  months  of  labour  spent  on  the  other  two  can-vases lost,  for  I  learned  something.

I  sometimes  have  regretted  that  I  didn't  go  to  the  Uni-versity at  home.  Of  course  it  would,  in  a  sense,  have  stiffened  myhand — I  often  see  the  lack  of  early  hand  training  in  the  work  of  artistswho  have  been  university  men.  One  must  acquire  ease  in  movingearly.  Hard  reading  helps  one  later — but  science  is  hard  to  get  un-less one  has  a  learned  man  over  one  early  —  Now  that  I  have  youngmen  under  me  I  do  my  best  to  keep  'em  hard  at  science .  I  can't  botherwith  more  than  one  helper  at  a  time —  and  take  only  those  who  havehad  as  thorough  a  training  as  schools  can  give  them    1  like  to  visitabout  once  a  year —  for  two  days.  I  can't  idle  about  and  I  hate  to104GERMAN  AND  AUSTRIAN  MEDALSshoot  or  fish —  and  loathe  cards —  and  that's  about  all  there  is  to  it.Bridge  whist  is  the  nuisance  of  the  age.  Cards  always  are,  to  me."In  Harper's  in  1903  Abbey  was  represented  by  his  drawings  toRichard  II. ,  King John ,  and  Romeo  and  Juliet.  In  July  he  had  receivedthrough  Lord  Lansdowne  a  gold  medal  for  Art  conferred  upon  himby  the  Kaiser  in  recognition  of  his  work  at  the  Berlin  Exhibition,where  his"Hamlet"paintinghadbeenhung.  It  has  since  been  mel-ted down,  together  with  those  from  Vienna  and  Munich,  for  theRed  Cross.In  1904, in  which  the  usual  cricket  week  was  found  to  be  imprac-ticable, there  is  no  letter  until  May ,  by  which  time  "A  Measure"  andthe  central  panel  of  the  reredos  for  the  American  Church  in  Pariswere  on  view  in  the  Royal  Academy.  Upon  "A  Measure"  this  notefrom  Stanford  White  has  some  bearing : ' '  Charlie  [Me  Kim]  says  thatyou  have  done  some  wonderful  things  for  Taylor's  house,  and  I  amdying  to  see  them.  I  think,  however,  that  it  will  be  hard  for  you  todo  anything  much  finer  than  the  beautiful  panel  you  did  for  White-law  Reid.  Every  time  I  see  it  I  fall  more  and  more  in  love  with  it.By  the  way,  if  I  could  get  the  Hon.  Whitelaw  to  consent  and  pay  forit  (as  I  suppose  it  will  cost  like  thunder),  would  you  let  me  have  alittle  manufactory  of  tapestries,  which  has  been  started  here,  try  toreproduce  it  on  tapestry?"  The  project,  however,  did  not  materia-lise, and  Stanford  White's  tragic  end  occurred  not  long  after.  Hehad  been  a  remarkable  influence  in  artistic  life  and  his  death  meanta  great  loss  to  American  architecture.It  is  now  time  to  say  something  more  definite  of  the  nature  of  thenew  task  on  which  Abbey  was  to  be  chiefly  occupied  for  the  remain-ing years  of  his  life — the  decorations  for  the  State  Capitol  at  Harris-burg,  in  Pennsylvania.  In  this  building  there  is  a  grand  staircasewhich  rises  from  the  ground  to  the  top  floor  and  is  surmounted  bya  dome.  The  architect's  first  proposition  to  Abbey  was  that  heshould  make  mural  paintings  for  the  collar  of  this  dome  and  alsofor  the  House  of  Representatives,  for  the  Senate  and  for  the  Su-preme Court,  all  of  which  chambers  gave  upon  the  different  floorsof  the  staircase:  but  upon  going  further  into  this  matter,  the  archi-4 0 2THE  HARRISBURG  CAPITOLtect  found  that  the  funds  at  his  disposal  were  insufficient  to  carryout  the  full  scheme  immediately,  and  accordingly  Abbey  was  askedto  make  the  paintings  for  the  dome  only.It  had  been  Abbey 's  original  intention  to  enshrine  in  the  dome  thevarious  religious  sects — (for  Pennsylvania  was  the  refuge  for  all  per-secuted sectaries,  and  here  were  Menno nit es,  Dunk ers,  Schwenk-felders,  Moravians  and  many  others) — and  to  reserve  the  designsof  the  Pennsylvanian  industries  for  one  of  the  State  Chambers,  butbelieving  that  his  work  was  to  be  limited  to  the  dome,  and  fearingthat  there  would  be  no  other  opportunity  to  depict  the  State  indus-tries, he  began  at  once  upon  the  designs  for  oil,  steel,  mines,  etc.,which  are  now  in  the  dome — four  lunettes,  each  38  feet  by  22  feet,and  four  circular  paintings,  each  14  feet  in  diameter,  for  the  pen-dentives — and  when,  in  1904,  the  Governor  of  Pennsylvania  signedthe  contract  for  the  remainder  of  the  decorative  scheme,  the  lu-nettes were  too  far  advanced  to  make  possible  any  change  in  thesedesigns.The  further  spaces  settled  upon  for  the  House  of  Representa-tives were  of  the  following  dimensions: — 35  feet  square  over  therostrum;  on  either  side  of  this — on  the  same  wall — a  space  12  feetwide  by  24  feet  high;  at  the  other  end  of  the  room,  opposite  the  ros-trum, some  further  spaces,  which,  however,  were  not  done;  and,  inthe  middle  of  the  ceiling,  a  circular  space  24  feet  in  diameter;  in  theSenate  Chamber  a  frieze  60  to  80  feet  long  by  9  feet  high ,  and  certainsmaller  spaces  on  the  wall  opposite.  With  the  exception,  however,of  the  "Valley  Forge  "for  one  of  these  smaller  spaces  Abbey  did  notlive  to  complete  any  paintings  for  either  the  Senate  or  for  the  Su-preme Court.There  were  difficulties  to  be  overcome  before  the  artist  succeededin  gaining  the  free  hand  which  to  him  was  an  absolute  necessity.  Inone  case  a  set  of  plans  had  been  sent  to  him  for  the  House  of  Repre-sentatives showing  two  rows  of  small  spaces  for  small  designs ,  to  fillthe  great  space,  35  feet  square,  over  the  rostrum,  where  the  "Apo-theosis of  Pennsylvania"  now  hangs  triumphant,  and  also  to  fill  thespaces  for  "Penn's  Treaty"  and  the  "Reading  of  the  Declaration,"403INITIAL  DIFFICULTIESwhich  are  now  on  either  side  of  it .  These  rows  of  designs  were  sepa-rated from  each  other  by  mouldings  nearly  two  feet  wide,  for,  as  theartist  was  to  be  paid  according  to  the  size  of  his  painting,  the  pricefor  painting  these  big  spaces  would  be  much  reduced  if  part  of  it  wascovered  with  wide  mouldings .  Abbey  refused  to  paint  a  wall  of  easelpictures,  but  offered  to  do  for  love  the  extra  space  which  the  re-moval of  the  mouldings  would  give  him,  and  thus  the  matter  wassettled.  The  mouldings  were  finally  removed  and  the  spaces  givenup  to  the  three  single  designs.  When  certain  authorities  wished  tointerfere  in  the  choice  of  subjects  he  insisted  that  the  choice  mustbe  left  to  him,  and  when  others  tried  to  confine  him  to  depicting  thehistory  of  Pennsylvania,  to  the  exclusion  of  allegorical  subjects,  hewould  agree  only  when  the  space  to  be  filled  lent  itself  in  his  opinionto  a  realistic  subject,  but  in  no  case  where  an  abstract  subject  wasabsolutely  needed.It  will  be  seen  that  the  artist  was  taking  upon  his  shoulders  a  gigan-tic burden  of  responsibility ,  which  was  not  lessened  by  certain  vacil-lations among  the  authorities  leading  to  much  correspondence  andnumerous  modifications.  Only  by  stipulating  for  a  free  hand  andeventually  getting  it  could  Abbey  have  done  so  much  towards  thecompletion  of  the  work  as  he  did .  For  example ,  we  find  him  writing,in  November,  1904,  "I  note  what  you  say  about  '  allegories ' — butthere  are  certain  spaces  where  realistic  subjects  are  absolutely  out  ofplace  and  abstract  subjects  are  as  absolutely  needed.  It  is  far  easierto  do  realistic  things  than  abstractions  or  allegories — that  is,  for  me—but  I  should  decline  to  paint  realistic  subjects  for  spaces  wherethey  are  inappropriate.  This  colour  scheme  is  a  most  difficult  job,but  I  have  got  it  nearly  finished.  ...  I  dare  say  it  is  difficult  to  makethe  powers  that  be  understand  that  designing  decorations  for  severalrooms  is  a  very  different  problem  from  merely  painting  a  series  ofpictures  having  no  colour  or  line  relation  to  each  other — and  that  anenormous  deal  of  arranging  has  to  be  undertaken  before  a  satisfac-tory arrangement  can  be  come  at.  However,  I  try  not  to  worry  aboutit,  but  I  do  worry  a  good  deal,  and  I  am  longing  to  get  it  settled  oneway  or  the  other  so  that  my  path  ahead  will  be  plain."404THE  "CORONATION"  EXHIBITEDHere,  for  the  present,  we  may  leave  the  Harrisburg  commission,remembering,  as  we  proceed ,  that  it  was  now  and  henceforward  theartist's  dominating  occupation.  Meanwhile  the  picture  of  the  Coro-nation was  completed,  and  at  the  end  of  October,  1904,  was  exhi-bited at  the  Hanover  Gallery  by  Messrs.  Agnew,  who  had  receivedpermission  from  the  King  to  reproduce  it;  and  after  they  had  exhi-bited it  in  London  and  in  various  provincial  towns  and  it  had  beenetched  for  them  by  Laguillermie ,  it  was  hung  in  Buckingham  Palace ,where  it  now  is.  A  reproduction  is  given  in  this  volume,  but  so  largeand  crowded  a  canvas  must  be  seen  to  be  rightly  understood  andappreciated.Earlier  in  this  year  (1904)  Abbey  had  been  invited  to  become  thefirst  President  of  the  newly  established  Bath  Society  of  Artists  andhad  accepted.  In  spite  of  his  many  engagements  he  prepared  a  littlespeech  for  the  opening  of  the  Society's  first  Exhibition,  and  on  No-vember i6th,  he  delivered  it.  His  few  remarks  were  typical  of  hisgood  sense  and  kindliness.  "In  these  days  of  centralisation,"  hesaid,  "when,  indeed,  the  inhabitants  of  a  town  point  with  pride  tothe  facilities  that  are  afforded  to  those  who  wish  to  get  elsewhere  asquickly  as  possible,  it  requires  no  little  courage  on  the  part  of  thoseof  its  citizens  who  practise  the  profession  of  painting  to  organisethemselves  and  engage  a  gallery  in  which  to  hold  an  exhibition.  Cen-tralisation has  the  effect  of  drawing  away  to  larger  towns  those  whowish  to  associate  with  a  greater  numb  er  of  others  practising  the  sameart  or  profession,  to  learn  of  them,  to  be  in  the  movement.  This  isnatural,  but  it  does  not  always  follow  that  they  should  be  forgottenby  those  they  leave  behind    In  the  great  days  of  art  (and  I  am  notsure  they  were  not  great  because  the  artist  was  given  the  opportunityto  be  great)  the  artists  of  a  town  were  almost  its  most  cherished  citi-zens. It  was  to  the  artist  that  rich  merchants  and  manufacturers— theMedici,  the  Strozzi,  the  Borgias — looked  to  make  themselves,  theirhouses,  and  their  cities  magnificent.  The  Church  was,  of  course,dependent  upon  the  artist  to  assist  in  diverting  the  thoughts  of  itsvotaries  from  material  things,  and  I  need  not  enlarge  upon  the  wayin  which  these  artists,  these  architects, sculp  tors,  and  painters  rose  to405A  PRESIDENTIAL  ADDRESSthe  occasion ,  for  their  work — or  much  of  it — lives  to  speak  for  them .The  more  intimate  histories  of  those  days —  the  lives  of  MichaelAngelo,  of  Raphael,  of  Benvenuto  Cellini,  and  many  more — are  fullof  tales  of  the  rivalry  of  Popes  and  Kings  and  rich  citizens  for  thepossession  of  the  services  of  these  artists"This  Exhibition  will,  we  hope,  draw  the  attention  of  the  peopleof  Bath  to  the  efforts  of  its  young  artists  and  by  timely  encourage-ment help  them  in  what— if  it  is  pursued  seriously— is  a  very  arduousprofession.  ...  It  is  not  to  be  expected  that  those  who  are  willingand  able  to  help  forward  youthful  talent  will  have  sufficient  expertknowledge  to  foresee  promise  of  future  distinction  in  the  tentativeefforts  of  the  young  men  of  Bath  and  its  neighbourhood,  who  sendtheir  pictures  here,  but  they  can  be  advised  by  those  who  have  thisknowledge  and  experience,  and  I  may  say  that  I  have  from  time  totime  had  the  privilege  of  drawing  the  attention  of  men  of  taste  andmeans  to  the  work  of  young  artists.  In  more  than  one  instance  a  time-ly commission  has  been  the  means  of  starting  a  career  which  mightotherwise  have  waited  a  long  time  for  its  opening  opportunity."Not  only  was  the  Coronation  now  behind  him  but  Abbey  had  alsodelivered  the  Royal  Exchange  panel ,  which  was  unveiled  on  D  ecem-ber  i  Qth ,  1 904 ,  by  the  Lady  Mayoress .  The  painting  represents  thetwo  masters—  of  the  Merchant  Taylors'  and  the  Skinners'  Com-panies, by  which  it  was  presented  to  the  Royal  Exchange — pledgingthemselves  in  their  new-found  amity  at  the  foot  of  the  Chair  of  Stateof  the  Lord  Mayor — the  event  marking  the  end  of  their  long  feud,in  1484.Concerning  Abbey 's  conception  of  lago  in  the  Tragedies  in  Har-per's Sir  Frank  Benson  wrote:  "I  hope  you  will  not  think  me  imper-tinent if  I  send  you  a  line  to  express  my  thanks  for  the  great  pleasure  Ihave  derived  from  seeing  your  wonderful  picture  of  lago  in  Harper 'sMagazine.  It  is  the  best  illustration  I  have  ever  seen  of  the  Borgiachapters  of  Italian  history.  I  would  like  to  ask  his  genesis  when  Inext  meet  you."4 0 6CHAPTER  XXXIXCOLUMBUS,  ST.

On  his  return  hetook  up,  for  variety,  an  old  theme  on  which  he  had  begun  to  work  aslong  ago  as  1892  —  "Columbus  in  the  New  World."  Itwill  be  seenfrom  the  photogravure  that  a  company  of  flamingoes  fly  across  thebackground  ,  and  in  order  to  make  studies  of  these  birds  we  find  thepainter  borrowing  a  flamingo  skin,  through  Sir  Edwin  Ray  Lan-kester,  from  the  Natural  History  Museum.  Not  only  was  the  fla-mingo necessary,  but  there  had  to  be  a  good  typical  Columbus  too,and  some  trustworthy  Spanish  ships.  The  model  for  the  Columbuswas  none  other  than  a  modern  navigator  of  eminence,  the  marinepainter  and  Abbey  's  friend  and  fellow  Academician,  the  late  C.  Na-pier Hemy.This  was  Abbey  's  invitation:  "I  have  a  very  decided  idea  that  youwould  be  a  fine  Christopher  Columbus!  It  seems  to  me  you  are  cutout  for  the  part.  I  know  how  retiring  and  modest  you  are,  but  I  begthat  you  will  put  all  personal  diffidence  aside  and  get  me  a  photo-graph of  yourself  in  the  position  roughly  indicated  overleaf.

Ishould  be  immensely  indebted  to  you  if  you  will  do  me  this  favour  .  '  '407NAUTICAL  PROBLEMSMr.  Hemy  having  agreed,  there  came  the  question  of  the  ships—but  here  is  an  amusing  letter  from  the  latter-day  Columbus  on  thistopic.  It  must  first  be  explained  that  after  searching  near  and  far  forthe  true  types  of  vessel  until  he  was  satisfied,  Abbey  set  his  assistantMr.  Simmonds  to  the  task  of  making  models  of  them  out  of  wood,cardboard,  plasticine,  and  string.  When  finished  they  were  photo-graphed and  copies  sent  to  Mr.  Hemy ,  as  one  who  knew  more  aboutships,  shipping  and  the  sea  than  any  one,  Mr.  Joseph  Conrad  notexcepted.Abbey  wrote:  "I  enclose  a  photo  of  the  fleet — with  some  trepi-dation. You  will  probably  tell  me  that  I  have  got  the  Topping-loftjib  staysail  mixed  up  with  the  appendicitis  halyards —  The  photois  clear  if  you  look  at  it  with  a  magnifying  glass.  I  am  a  little  vagueabout  the  stern  arrangements.  The  fleet  is  supposed  to  be  lying  atanchor — C.C.  having  just  landed    The  figures  are  just  under  lifesize.  The  canvas  is  10  feet  by  7  feet  3  inches.  Are  the  sails  tied  upright  ?  The  ships  are  yellow  with  red  lines ." I've  two  other  little  things  but  I  shall  not  send  them  in:  they  areeach  37  feet  by  22  feet."Mr .  H  emy  's  reply  records  his  reception  of  the  unfortunate  argosy ,which  was,  of  course,  promptly  overhauled  and  refound."Churchfield,  Falmouth,"DEARABBEY,  "Mardl  '^  '^"  The  original  C  .C .  was  sent  across  the  pond  in  a  queer  lot  of  ships ,but  the  ramshackle  freaks  his  humble  understudy  has  been  given  byyou  are  impossible.  I  protest!  I  never  could  have  got  over  in  them.The  fact  that  you  are  painting  me  landing  in  my  store  clothes —  mySunday  best — won't  make  up  for  that  shabby  fleet.  Old  Baron  Leysused  to  get  a  model,  and  paint  him  in  his  own  modern  clothes  andthen  with  great  skill  get  rid  of  his  modern  look  and  work  in  the  oldstyle  (always  wrong).  Now  the  way  I  think  to  do  your  ships  is  toget  some  good-natured  sea  painter  to  lend  you  a  study  or  two  of  amodern  ship  done  from  nature — at  anchor  in  a  sunny  sea.  The  sunand  the  sea  and  the  sky  are  the  same  as  in  1492.  And  the  ship  is  a4 0 8C.  NAPIER  HEMYship.  The  tomfoolery  the  old  chaps  put  about  their  ships  can  bestuck  on  after  you  have  got  the  sky ,  sea  and  ship .  Am  I  right  ?  Yes !it  is  a  pity  we  are  so  far  apart,  have  you  not  a  motor  that  travels  ahundred  miles  an  hour?  By  the  way  that  cap  makes  me  look  veryold .  Looking  at  my  face  it  is  a  clear  tan  and  that  sketch  I  sent  you  iswrong.  There  is  no  hurry  for  the  photos  for  a  week  or  so,  only  send'em  all  back  except  the  three  taken  for  you.  Can  you  not  get  somephotographs  of  the  ships  which  were  rebuilt  in  1 892 —  that  engrav-ing in  Harper's  is  from  a  photo  of  the  very  ship .  Are  not  the  photosof  my  model  fine?  .  .  It  belonged  to  Nelson,  and  has  a  splendid  oldcase.  Some  one,  Mark  Twain,  said  it  was  a  wonderful  thing  thediscovery  of  America  by  C.C.,  but  it  would  have  been  much  morewonderful  if  he  had  not  discovered  it.  It  would  have  been  muchmore  wonderful  than  ever  had  he  got  across  with  your  fleet.  Afterthis  parting  insult  to  it  I  will  shut  up ."Yours  ever,  "C.N.H."

""This  criticism,"  says  Mr.  Simmonds,  "provided  a  joke  againstme  for  the  rest  of  my  stay  at  Fairford,  I  having  made  the  models."A  letter  to  Dr. White  in  March  suggests,  and  for  the  first  time,that  Abbey's  swift  direct  methods  were  at  variance  with  the  some-what leisurely  processes  of  Philadelphia.  Delays  in  correspondenceabout  Harrisburg  were  continual.  "I'm  tied  here,"  he  says,  "sadlyin  need  of  fresh  protoplasm  (you  will  find  this  word  in  the  CenturyDie.)

Choate ,  theretiring  U.S.  Ambassador,  to  be  succeeded  by  Mr.Whitelaw  Reid.On  the  22nd  he  wrote  to  Mr.  Choate 's  predecessor,  John  Hay:  "It  is409JOHN  HAYextraordinary,  when  one  looks  back  over  it,  the  amount  you  haveaccomplished  in  the  last  twenty  years    You  have  made  a  differ-ence in  the  world's  history  since  those  days —  and  every  Americanworthy  of  the  name  is  glad  you  were  born.  I  have  from  time  to  timehad  letters — in  my  head —  to  you,  but  they  have  not  got  themselveswritten.  So  many  things  seem  to  happen —  so  many  catastrophesand  matters  that  are  really  of  moment —  that  the  affairs  of  a  hard-working artist  and  the  news  of  his  circle  take  on  rather  a  colourlesstint.  And  then,  people  die,  during  the  past  year  or  two  the  gaps  havebeen  many  and  irreparable,  and  one  feels  that  one  must  cling  toone's  remaining  friends  with  both  hands."  This  letter  was  crossedby  one  from  Hay,  the  last  letter  that  his  old  friend,  then  an  ailingman  with  serious  heart  weakness,  was  to  write  to  him ."BadNauheim,"MYDEARABBEY,  "May  24th,  I9O5  ."Getting  sick  and  dying  is  not  nearly  so  serious  a  matter  as  it  isto  lose  sight  and  touch  of  one's  friends  in  the  process.

Benson's  Eleven;  but  against  a  team  ofvictorious  authors  at  Esher  he  failed  to  score.In  June  John  Hay  was  in  London  for  a  few  days ,  declining  all  invi-tations except  to  lunch  with  the  Abbeys.  After  lunch  he  expressedthe  wish  to  see  the  work  in  the  studio.  He  refused  to  be  carriedupstairs,  but  walked  very  slowly  and  obviously  with  some  distress.Among  the  canvases,  however,  he  became  almost  his  old  self  againand  was  interested  in  all — the  Columbus,  the  Harrisburg  decora-tions, the  reredos,  and  the  more  recent  drawings  for  the  Tragedies.Abbey  never  saw  him  again :  he  died  aged  sixty-six.The  Fairford  Week  was  in  August,  beginning  with  a  very  closematch  against  Mr.  E.T.Cripps's  Eleven  which  Abbey 'sside  won  byfour  runs,  214  to  210.  H.  J.  Ford  and  L.  C.  Nightingale  were  topscorers  with  44  and  40.  In  the  return  match  Mr.  Cripps's  Elevenwon .  The  next  was  a  smashing  victory  over  Mr.  R.  Dimsdale's  side :H.J.Ford32,G.H.Swinstead38,K.T.M.Teesdale29,and  GerardChowne  (who  was  killed  in  the  War)  37.  In  this  match  WilliamAbbey,  on  a  visit  from  America,  played  and  made  i ,  a  score  justequalled  by  his  brother.  The  final  match  was  against  the  Rev.  C.  M.4 1 1A  MEDALLION  PORTRAITR.  Luckman's  Eleven,  and  in  spite  of  49  by  H .  J .  Ford  and  49  not  outby  George  Gascoyne,  was  lost.  This,  had  they  known  it,  was  the  lastFairford  cricket  week.In  June  of  this  year  Mr.  G.W.  Stewart,  the  architect  of  the  Cand-ler  Building  in  Atlanta,  Georgia,  U.S.A.,  had  written  to  Abbey,stating  that  a  series  of  medallions  was  intended  for  the  facade  ofthat  structure,  each  to  commemorate  an  art,  science,  craft,  pro-fession or  trade,  with  a  relief  portrait  of  one  of  the  most  illustriousexponents  in  the  middle.  He  requested  Abbey ,  as  a  chosen  repre-sentative of  painting,  to  send  him  a  photograph  in  profile,  and  itwas  for  this  purpose  that,  during  the  progress  of  this  last  cricketweek,  Mr.  Swinstead  took  the  fine  photograph  which  is  here  repro-duced, with  the  shirt  left  open  at  the  neck  to  assist  the  sculptor.Such ,  however ,  was  Abbey 's  dislike  of  any  thing  that  seemed  even  tosavour  of  affectation  in  artists  that  he  would  never  allow  this  photo-graph to  be  seen,  and  it  is  now  for  the  first  time  made  public.Writing  to  Walter  James  in  September  Abbey  asks  literally  forlocal  colour  from  Northumberland.  "I  wonder  if  you  would  do  mea  rough  little  sketch  of  the  kind  of  ground  coal  grows  in — or  iron  ?

Abbey'sletter  acknowledging  his  efforts  contains  an  amusing  passage  on  therecent  election:  "There  is  much  indignation  over  the  enthusiasm  ofa  Liberal  band  at  East  L  each .

The  Sherman  group  is  in  Central  Park,  NewYork,  the  General  being  preceded  by  a  noble  figure  of  Victory.St.  Gaudens 's  enclosure, written  to  Mr.Paton,  runs  thus :  "Youwould  be  surprised  to  see  how  I  am  perpetrating  this  letter.  It  iseight  o'clock  in  the  morning;  I  am  on  the  porch  of  my  studio,  whichfaces  south;  just  above  is  a  vine-covered  trellis;  the  vine  is  not  fullyleaved,  but  enough  so  that  the  sunlight  shimmers  through  easily.Five  miles  beyond  the  portico  is  Ascutney  mountain,  which  is  theheightof  Vesuvius  and  very  muchitsshape.  The  sky  is  one  of  thosewonderful  soft  European  ones.  The  breeze  is  light  and  gentle  andthere  is  something  consoling  in  it  all,  something  poetic."Well  !

What  I  have  written  here  is  so  poetical  that  I  think  I  willhave  the  typewriter  repeat  it  to  him."Although  the  Jeff  erson  costume  incident  was  not  completed  untilthe  following  year,  let  it  be  rounded  off  at  this  point.  Writing  to  St.Gaudens  on  May  24th,  1907,  Abbey  says:  "I  sent  off  yesterday  bythe  American  express — carriage  paid —  a  small  parcel  containingtwo  old  coats,  a  ditto  waistcoat,  and  an  aged  pair  of  nankeen  breeches .One  coat  has  but  one  tail,  and  is  otherwise  in  bad  repair — but,  likeus,  it  still  has  style."  St.  Gaudens  replied  on  June  i8th,  1907 :"DEAR  OLD  FELLOW. — Just  a  word  to  tell  you  that  the  package  hasarrived.  Two  coats,  one  vest,  and  a  pair  of  breeches,  all  admirablefor  my  purpose,  and  in  good  condition.  I  bless  you  with  all  my  heartand  wish  I  were  with  you  to  thank  you  personally.  Send  the  bill  assoon  as  you  can.  I  would  write  a  long  letter  but  I  can't.

The  bill  was  never  found,  and  therefore  not  sent,  the  explanationbei  ng  given  by  Abbey  in  a  letter  to  Mr.  Low  in  1 908,  recalling  thoseearly  days  in  New  York,  when  he  had  the  studio  in  Old  UniversityBuilding.  "It  was  there,"  Abbey  says,  "that  St.  Gaudens  came  tosee  me  one  day — I  think  in  '75 — escorted  by  little  Joe  Evans,  to  askabout  a  uniform  for  Sergeant  Jasper,  of  whom  he  was  going  to  do  aportrait  statue  for  Charleston  ;  and  it  is  to  my  everlasting  discreditand  humiliation  that  /  was  short  with  him .  The  truth  is  Jimmy  Kellyabout  that  time  was  active  in  getting  up  the  Art  Students'  League,425AN  ACT  OF  REPARATIONand  he  and  Joe  Evans  and  one  or  two  more  would  hold  caucuses,business  meetings ,  etc .  ,in  the  corners ,  in  a  whisper ,  which  finally  gota  bit  too  thick  ..  .  and  when  St.  Gaudens  was  brought  in,  I  thoughthe  was  another,  and  I'm  not  sure  I  didn't  tell  him  I  couldn't  bebothered  or  some  beastly  thing  (it  will  always  rankle) .  I  saw  in  somepaper  that  he  was  going  to  do  a  statue  of  T .  Jefferson,  and  thereforeI  got  and  sent  him  a  genuine  lot  of  garments  of  the  period — but  Inever  told  him  why."Mr.  Low's  comment  on  this  incident —  in  his  lecture  on  Abbeyand  Howard  Pyle,  from  which  quotations  have  already  been  made— must  be  recorded.  "  'I  nevertold  him  why,' "  he  repeats:  "thereyou  have  the  whole  man  drawn  by  his  own  graphic  pen.  Petulant  attimes,  no  outburst  of  this  kind  that  was  not  repented  at  once,  andsome  kindness  repaid  extravagantly  the  momentary  petulance."St.  Gaudens  lived  only  a  brief  time  in  which  to  enjoy  his  Englishhonours.  He  died  on  August  3rd  in  1907.Resuming  the  record  of  1906,3  letter  of  Abbey 's  to  Dr.  White,  onFebruary  9th,  has  some  characteristic  passages:  "I  did  not  agreewith  what  you  said  about  feetball.  As  you  know,  I  think  a  gameshould  be  played  more  for  the  fun  of  playing  it  well,  and  when  it  getsso  classy  that  each  man  has  to  have  a  trainer  and  rubber  it  gets  toogood .  I  think,  too ,  that  the  desire  to  win — anyhow — is  a  poor  thing .However,  you  wouldn't  agree  with  me.  I  don't  believe,  neverthe-less, that  you  would  enjoy  playing  chess  with  a  man  who  stole  yourpieces  off  the  board  in  order  to  win."There  has  been  an  election,  and  all  the  men  you  know  havebeendefeated,  and  all  the  other  men  you  are  acquainted  with  have  beenelected  to  Parliament.

Shelton,  the  Secretary  of  the  Club ,  and  the  interpolatednote  is  from  Mr.  Harry  Fenn,  the  illustrator:"MY  DEAR  ABBEY,  "March  8th,  1906.' '  I  got  the  mug  out  of  the  Pub  lie  Stores  this  morning .  A  wise  offi-cial valued  it  at  £1 ,  decorated  crockery  at  60  %  art  tax.  I  paid  thethree  dollars,  a  few  cents  short,  and  walked  out  with  the  box.  Youare  an  angel,  but  you  are  not  a  good  packer;  it  moved  a  little  withevery  roll  of  the  ship —  like  a  man  breathing —  and  the  fellow  in  thepot  hat  got  his  ankles  rubbed  slightly,  likewise  his  neighbour  inspots.  This  maybe  an  improvement — it  gives  it  age.  If  there  areany  spots  that  mar  it  I  will  touch  it  judiciously."We  dined  Sir  Purdon  Clarke  the  other  day ,  and  he  is  wild  to  painta  mug  next  year.  Your  mug  is  number  14  in  order  of  arrival  but427THE  SALMAGUNDI  MUGSnumber  24  at  the  sale.  I  haven 'tgot  Smith's  yet.  The  dinner  will  beabout  the  middle  of  April .  You  will  receive  your  invitation  and  wewill  put  your  empty  chair  in  mourning.  It  is  a  great  auction.  Isoldone  mug  last  year  for  202  dollars.  I  bid  it  in  for  a  member  who  hap-pened to  be  in  Paris  and  sent  me  that  sum  for  any  old  mug.  I  soldone  of  HowardPyle'sfor  100  dollars  in  1901 ,  and  one  of  Beckwith'sfor  75  dollars  in  1903,  but  that  was  before  mugs  riz.  Harry  Fennhas  just  been  cleaning  up  the  edges  and  touching  up  the  high  lightsas  only  he  can."DEAR  ABBEY. — Just  a  line  to  say  'How  are  you?'  Your  mug  isjolly  in  ever}7  way .  It  is  just  possible  I  may  be  in  London  this  sum-mer;  if  so  I  will  do  myself  the  pleasure  of  looking  you  up .' '  Sincerely  yours ,  H .

It  will  appearfirst  at  the  said  Library  dinner  with  the  menu  on  the  last  page."Yours  in  gratitude,"W.  H.  SHELTON."From  Mr.  Shehon's  History  of  the  Salmagundi  Club, published  in1 9 1 8  by  the  Houghton  Mifflin  Co . ,  I  borrow  the  account  of  Abbey 'scontribution : "  The  decoration  was  one  of  Abbey 's  quaint  and  play-ful designs.  An  English  village  inn,  with  barmaid  in  the  door,  ispictured  on  one  side  of  the  mug,  and  on  the  other  are  three  veryAbbey esque  figures — a  jolly  roysterer  with  pipe  and  bowl,  a  bell-ringer,  ringing;  and  between  the  two  a  half-tipsy  Puritan,  whomthey  are  evidently  leading  astray,  and  circling  the  top  and  bottomof  the  mug  this  rollicking  couplet:'He  that  will  not  merry,  merry  be,  with  generous  bowl  and  toast,May  he  in  Bridewell  be  shut  up  and  fast  bound  to  a  post.'—Abbey's  mug  was  knocked  down  to  Mr.  Saltus  for  461  dollars."The  Abbeys  had  been  using  their  car,  often  on  long  journeys,in  search  of  a  new  home,  for  it  was  Abbey's  intention  to  give  upMorgan  Hall  at  the  end  of  his  lease  and  buy  a  country  house  of  hisown — one  with  architectural  features  of  an  earlier  date,  where  he4 2 8THE  "COLUMBUS"would  have  room  for  his  large  and  ever-increasing  library ,  and  wherehis  studio  would  be  more  remote  from  farmyards ,  with  all  their  dis-tractions, than  at  Fairford.  In  search  of  this  ideal  place,  and  armedwith  order  to  view  from  advertisers  in  Country  Life,  Henry  Jameswas  often  one  of  the  company.  At  first  he  had  favoured  and  encou-raged Abbey's  scheme,  but  later,  in  March,  we  find  him  writing:"The  only  way  to  appear  as  meek  and  lowly  and  'restricted'  as  youare  is  just  to  keep  on  quietly  with  Morgan  Hall,  Chelsea  Lodge,  themotor — and  H  enry  James . ' 'Abbey  was  represented  this  year  at  the  Royal  Academy  by  his"Columbus  in  the  New  World. "Columbus,  richly  clad  and  in  fullarmour,  grasping  the  Royal  banner  of  Spain,  kneels  behind  thethree  priests ,  who ,  clothed  in  magnificent  black  and  gold  vestments ,are  consecrating  the  New  World  before  an  improvised  altar  coveredwith  red  velvet .  A  further  group ,  among  them  the  brothers  Pinzon,who  commanded  the  two  caravels ,  kneel  apart ,  and  three  of  the  com-pany bear  aloft  the  banners  of  the"Green  Cross,"  a  device  of  Co-lumbus, presented  to  him  by  Ferdinand  and  Isabella.  Farther  awayare  the  sailors  and  the  three  ships  at  anchor,  while  the  backgroundis  filled  with  a  flight  of  flamingoes,  streaming  away  from  the  land,thus  symbolising  the  departure  of  the  native,  the  indigenous,  thewild,  upon  the  arrival  of  the  foreign  and  the  cultivated  to  implantcivilisation.  The  picture,  very  fine  in  colour  and  design,  was,  in  theforeground,  not  altogether  satisfactory  to  Abbey,  and  he  intendedto  make  further  studies  for  it  at  the  seashore  later  on,  but  so  muchnew  work  lay  before  him  that  the  time  never  came.In  May  Abbey  made  for  Miss  Ellen  Terry  a  drawing  of  Olivia  inThe  Vicar  of  Wakefield  for  the  souvenir  programme  of  the  greatactress's  dramatic  jubilee,  June  i2th,  1906.  Miss  Terry's  letter  ofacknowledgment  says:  "You  are  angelic — but  you  can't  help  that."This  was  Abbey's  last  task  for  a  long  while,  for  at  the  end  of  May,suddenly,  came  the  breakdown  of  which  from  time  to  time  we  haveseen  foreshado wings,  and  for  several  months  Abbey  was  far  fromhis  happy  vigorous  self.  A  letter  to  Dr.  White  on  June  i  st  tells  some-thing of  the  trouble:  "You  must  excuse  a  scrawl.  I  have  been  ill  andVOL.  n. — M  429WISE  COUNSELcan  scarcely  see  now .  A  bad  cold  on  the  liver — and  I  am  afraid  a  littleoverwork  and  over-anxiety — worries  and  worries!  I  disrememberif  I  ever  felt  so  dambad    "  Five  days  later  Abbey  says  that  he  hasseen  Osier  and  has  been  sent  to  bed,  and  a  little  later,  when  strongenough ,  he  went  to  Swanage.We  find  Henry  James  again  as  counsellor  when,  on  July  6th,  hewrote  to  Mrs.  Abbey:  "...  Ned's  indisposition,  of  which  I  heardsomething  from  J.B.Warner,  interests  me  not  less,  and  I  hope  withall  my  heart  that  demon,  too,  is  exorcised    It  is  too  long  a  stretchof  work — of  work  at  high  pressure.  Slow  down,  put  on  the  brakes,stop  at  every  station ,  and  visit  the  refreshment  room .  That  is  all  youwant — more  buns  and  ginger-beer  and  Tti-Bits(ai  the  news-stand),and  less  mere  steaming  ahead .  I  do  hope  this  system  is  already  show-ing good  results.  I  didn't  write,  as  I  was  moved  to,  after  Joe  Warnertold  me  of  your  going  to  Swanage,  because  I  have  long  since  learnedthat  the  cloud  of  enquiring  letters  in  cases  of  Modern  Illness  add  anew  terror  to  the  state  alike  of  Patient  and  Nurse    Keep  it  up — Imean  the  keeping  of  it  down  (the  fever  of  creation  and  the  storm  andstress  of  the  studio).  Above  all,  don't  worry —  everything  arrangesitself.  I  pat  Edwin  very  affectionately  and  healingly  and  soothinglyon  the  back  and  dream  of  the  day  when  I  may  see  you  again."On  recovering  sufficiently  Abbey  returned  to  Fairford,  and  thenmade  for  the  Tyrol  and  Italy.  Work  was  not  to  be  thought  of,  opticaltrouble  being  feared,  but  as  it  turned  out  nothing  was  wrong  there.Letters  to  Mr.  Swinstead  and  to  Mr.  Clarke,  both  in  December,givethe  artist's  own  account  of  his  pilgrimage.  To  Mr. Swinstead:  "Iam  getting  right  again — but  I  have  to  go  slowly  as  I  easily  tire.  I  hopeto  be  a  boy  again  soon  now —  and  next  season  will  see  me  with  mylittle  bat  and  ball,  chopping  across,  as  usual    We  went  to  a  drearyhole  called  Swanage —  where  I  saw  with  entire  absence  of  interest942,856,311,046,122,460  children  digging  sand.  Thenwewenttothe  Austrian  Tyrol.  .  .  The  Austrian  Tyrol  would  suit  you  down  tothe  ground,  in  places.

There  is  no  cricket  going .4 3 0A  TYROLEAN  HOLIDAYBoys  borrow  their  Pa's  whips  in  the  evening— and  do  stunts  crack-ing them.  The  valleys  re-echo  the  reports —  and  that  seems  to  bethe  game.  By  the  way,  the  Rhodes  scholars  are  coming  to  play  agame  of  base-ball  at  Fairford  in  the  spring.  I  wish  you  would  comeand  see  it."To  Mr.  Clarke:  "We  went  abroad  in  September  to  Innsbruck  fora  few  days  and  then  to  Stertzing  for  a  few  more  days —  a  most  pic-turesque old  town — and  then  to  Waidbruck  (all  along  the  Brenner)and  from  there  up  to  St.Ulrich's — which  we  didn't  like — and  thenback  to  Waidbruck  and  up  a  tortuous  and  picturesque  road  to  Cas-telruth — where  we  stayed  some  little  time.  I  advise  you  to  go  theresome  time.  Then  we  went  to  Bozen  and  from  there  to  Levico—where  there  is  a  new  and  gorgeous  hotel —  some  kind  of  baths  verypopular  with  Italians.  We  went  thence  to  Belluno.  We  drove  fromsome  station — can't  remember  the  name —  and  after  a  night  at  Bel-luno we  got  a  machine  [a  little  carriage]  and  drove  to  Cortina —  thedrive  you  recommended.  It  was  very  beautiful —  and  if  I  were  alandscape  painter  I  should  be  tempted  to  pitch  my  tent  at  Cadore  fora  bit.  Cortina  was  closing —  and  we  were  the  last  out  of  the  hotel—the  big  hotel  up  high —  a  first-rate  place —  but  Cortina  is  a  bit  toowatering-placey  for  the  likes  of  us.  I  like  to  see  the  natives  when  Igo  abroad.' '  We  went  to  Munich  for  a  few  days — but  how  it  has  changed  in  halfa  dozen  years !  A  dreadful  tram ,  ramping  through  the  place — butthisis  nowcommon  to  all  theseplaces  abroad.They  seem  to  revel  in  noise .London  can't  say  a  great  deal  for  itself  either  nowadays.  Thesemotor  'buses  are  maddening.  London  used  to  be  the  quietest  city  Iknew  of — but  a  couple  of  years  have  completely  changed  that."Abbey  returned  to  England  early  in  October  and  stopped  at  Chel-sea Lodge  to  finish  the  reredos  for  Paris — particularly  the  Magdalenafter  the  Resurrection.  Dr. Morgan, thevicar, who  had  goneto  Fair-ford  the  previous  spring  to  see  the  reredos,  had  been  pressing  forits  delivery.  With  one  exception  he  was  altogether  satisfied,  but  hethought  the  face  of  the  Magdalen  too  "mundane"  and  wrote  beg-ging Abbey  to  repaint  it.  This  for  a  long  time  Abbey  refused  to  do,THE  PARIS  REREDOSfor  he  considered  it  the  best  head  he  had  ever  produced,  but  finally— to  get  the  reredos  away — he  yielded,  and  never  ceased  to  regretthat  he  had  done  so.  He  expected  to  finish  it  in  about  five  weeks,but  one  change  led  to  another,  and  five  months  passed  before  it  wasbrought  to  a  conclusion,  and  not  then  to  his  satisfaction.  Withoutwaiting  for  the  opening  of  the  Royal  Academy,  and  in  spite  of  thefact  that  he  would  have  nothing  there  in  that  year  of  1 907 ,  he  had  thereredos  sent  at  once  to  its  destination.  Consequently  he  was  not  inFairford  until  March  and  did  not  return  to  town  for  any  length  oftime  until  he  took  the  Harrisburg  work  to  the  Imperial  Institute  inthe  spring  of  the  following  year.One  other  letter  should  be  quoted  before  we  leave  1906.  It  is  tothe  late  Thomas  Bailey  Aldrich,  the  American  poet.  The  date  isNovember  i5th,  1906:"MY  DEAR  ALDRICH,"As  I  was  going  into  the  Athenaeum  the  other  afternoon  I  metDobson  coming  out.  He  explained  that  he  had  been  doing  a  ron-deau in  commemoration  of  your  seventieth  birthday."Says  I ,  'You  are  mixed,  dear  friend — you  mean  Alden;  Aldrichis  nowhere  near  seventy — I  don't  know  where  he  is,  for  it  is  thesemany  decades  since  I  have  seen  him,  but  he  isn't  seventy.  Sendthe  rondeau  to  Alden.'  He  said  it  was  then  too  late — as  it  was  inthe  post — and  seemed  positive  that  he  hadn't  made  any  mistake."I  think  still  that  he  has,  but  in  order  to  be  in  anything  that  isgoing,  I  send  a  line  to  say  how  glad  I  am  about  it !  I  can't  writeanything  original  about,  or  to,  folks  who  are  seventy.  I  spend  agood  deal  of  time  sending  congratulations  about — but,  original  ornot,  I  wish  that  the  succeeding  years  may  bring  more  and  morepower  to  your  elbow — and  before  you  are  much  older  than  youare  (whatever  age  that  may  be!)

I  had  fully  expected  to  have  theseready  for  the  opening  of  the  new  Capitol,  but  in  my  anxiety  to  dothis  I  put  on  extra  pressure  at  a  time  when  I  should  have  been  tak-ing a  holiday,  and  consequently  I  overworked  and  broke  down .  Asyou  know,  I  was  taken  seriously  ill  a  year  ago,  and  for  many  monthswas  unable  to  go  on  with  my  work  at  all,  and  was  compelled  by  mydoctors  to  take  a  complete  rest.  This  has  put  the  work  back,  but  Iam  thankful  to  say  that  my  health  is  now  completely  restored  andthe  work  is  once  more  progressing  rapidly.  I  confidently  expect  tocomplete  the  four  lunettes  and  the  four  circular  canvases  for  thedome  this  autumn."Of  the  four  lunettes,  each  approximately  38  feet  by  22  feet,three  are  practically  finished.  The  four  circular  canvases  for  thependentives,  each  14  feet  in  diameter,  are  also  practically  finished.434HARRISBURG  DECORATIONSThese  four  represent  respectively  'Law,  "Religion,"  Science,"  Art.'The  figures  are  9  feet  high,  on  a  gold  background  (goldleaf)."The  figures  in  the  lunettes  are  also  9  feet  high,  and  represent:"(i)'ScienceRevealingtheTreasuresoftheEarth.'  Anopenmineis  in  the  foreground,  with  miners  climbing  down  into  it,  and  in  theearly*  morning  sky,  poised  over  the  mine  are  three  figures:  'Science'pointing  to  the  mine,  accompanied  by  'Fortune'  and  'Abundance.'The  trunks  of  huge,  primeval  trees  rise  from  the  surface  of  the  mineand  a  rich  landscape  indicates  that,  in  spite  of  the  abundance  of  thefruits  of  the  earth's  surface,  a  wealth  of  treasure  lies  below  it."(2)  'The  Spirit  of  Vulcan.'  Here  are  groups  of  iron  and  steelworkers,  about  twenty  figures,  each  9  feet  high:  some  engaged  inhammering  out  a  rudder  post,  others  shaping  red-hot  steel  armour-plate  in  a  'bending  press,'  others  at  work  with  other  machinery — inthe  background  smelting  furnaces,  etc.,  the  size  of  the  huge  mach-ines in  proportion  to  the  figures,  and  at  the  top,  in  clouds  of  steamand  smoke,  presiding  over  the  place,  sits  Vulcan,  the  Genius  of  theworkers  in  iron  and  steel."

I  also  provided  myself  with  modelsChanged  later  to  a  golden  sky.435HARRISBURG  DECORATIONSof  ships  and  other  necessary  properties.  I  was  enabled  to  studyand  make  studies  of  effects  in  the  iron  works  on  the  Tyne.  The  de-tails of  all  the  machinery  have  been  supplied  to  me  by  the  works  atBethlehem,  Pennsylvania."So  far  Abbey  has  been  describing  what  he  had  finished  or  almostfinished.  He  now  turns  to  the  remainder  of  his  great  task:' '  The  House  of  Representatives."I  have  made  all  the  necessary  preliminary  research  for  the  workI  propose  to  do  in  the  House  of  Representatives;  have  providedmyself  with  the  necessary  literature  on  the  subject;  have  been  al-lowed by  the  authoritiesat  South  Kensington  Museum  to  have  care-ful copies  made  of  a  number  of  original  articles  of  dress  of  the  timeof  William  Penn,  from  an  unique  collection  in  their  possession;  andhave  prepared  the  designs  for  all  the  principal  spaces  in  this  cham-ber and  have  made  many  preparatory  studies  for  this  work."The  middle  panel,  back  of  the  rostrum,  is  an  elaborate  com-position, 35  feet  square,  representing  an  Apotheosis  of  the  Stateof  Pennsylvania,  and  composed  of  fifty  to  seventy  life-sized  figures.A  figure  typifying  'Pennsylvania'  sits  at  the  top  in  the  middle,  andunderneath ,  on  the  p  edestal  supporting  this  figure ,  are  figures  of  theearly  founders  of  the  Commonwealth.  Below  these  are  seated  fig-ures of  governors,  jurists,  senators,  personages  of  eminence  in  thehistory  of  the  State.  Below  these,  to  the  left,  are  figures  of  soldiersof  '6 1 ,  etc.,  hurrying  to  the  defence  of  the  State,  and  to  the  right  aregroups  of  mechanics,  miners,  etc.,  etc.  In  the  background  are  shipson  the  stocks,  blast  furnaces,  etc."To  the  right  and  left  of  the  middle  panel  are  two  other  panels:'Penn's  Treaty  with  the  Indians,'  on  the  left;  and  'The  Reading  ofthe  Declaration  of  Independence'  on  the  right."The  design  for  the  circular  panel  in  the  ceiling  of  this  chamber,24  feet  in  diameter,  is  also  completed  and  some  of  the  studies  pre-pared. This  design  is  composed  of  twenty-four  figures;  the  back-ground is  blue  with  gold  stars  and  the  Signs  of  the  Zodiac  in  gold.I  think  this  is  one  of  the  most  successful  designs  I  have  ever  made.4 3 6HARRISBURG  DECORATIONS"The  Senate."With  regard  to  the  Senate,  I  have  already  made  two  series  ofdesigns  for  this  chamber.  The  first  series  fitted  the  shapes,  sizes,and  position  of  the  spaces  allotted  to  me  according  to  the  first  setof  architectural  plans  sent  me  by  the  architect.  After  these  planswere  altered  and  a  second  set  was  sent  me,  I  made  a  second  seriesof  designs,  suited  to  the  changed  shapes,  sizes  and  positions  of  thesecond  set  of  plans.  After  this,  still  a  third  set  of  plans  was  sentme,  in  which  the  shapes,  sizes,  and  positions  of  the  spaces  werealtogether  different  from  either  of  the  two  preceding,  and,  in  con-sequence of  this  a  great  amount  of  my  time,  energy  and  labour  hasbeen  wasted,  and  I  must  spend  further  thought  upon  the  presentarrangement  before  settling  finally  on  the  designs  for  this  chamber."I  may  say  that  this  condition  of  things  was  true  also  of  the  spacesin  the  House  of  Representatives,  and  I  lost  much  time  in  rearrang-ing my  designs  to  suit  the  new  arrangement  of  spaces,  but  the  newspaces  here  lent  themselves  more  readily  to  these  designs  than  willbe  the  case  with  the  spaces  in  the  Senate."Abbey 's  own  difficulties  over  the  changing  dimensions  or  propor-tions in  the  Harrisburg  building  plans  no  doubt  emphasised  his  be-lief in  the  importance  to  the  decorative  painter  of  a  thorough  knowr-ledge  of  every  architectural  detail  of  the  rooms  he  is  to  decorate.  Theyalso  peculiarly  fitted  him  for  the  post  of  "Visitor"  for  the  School  ofPaintingattheRoyalCollegeofArt,SouthKensington,wherehewason  the  Council  for  three  years —  1907-1910.  Mr.  Augustus  Spencer,then  Principal  and  Head  Master  of  the  College,  has  set  down  a  fewnotes  referring  to  Abbey's  work  there  :  "  He  was  keenly  interested[says  Mr.  Spencer]  in  forming  a  British  School  of  Decorative  Art,and  he  told  me  that  this  was  his  aim  in  consenting  to  act  as' Visitor.'"In  going  the  round  of  the  studios  he  impressed  upon  the  stu-dents, above  all  things,  the  necessity  for  sound  draughtsmanship,as  fundamental  to  all  art  worthy  the  name.  He  would  have  nothingleft  to  chance .  I  n  the  figure  compositions  he  insisted  upon  full-sizedcartoons  being  made  in  charcoal,  and  carried  out,  as  far  as  possible,437AS  ART  "VISITOR"in  that  medium,  which  proved  a  great  help  in  executing  the  com-position in  colour."His  genial  and  kindly  manner,  backed  by  his  profound  know-ledge, led  the  students  to  look  forward  eagerly  to  his  visits,  as  theyknew  he  would  have  some  new  inspiration  to  impart  to  them."He  was  in  full  sympathy  with  the  broad  basis  upon  which  theCollege  training  was  founded .  The  lectures  upon  Greek  andRomanmythology  and  the  History  of  European  Civilisation  and  Art  heregarded  as  necessary  to  feed  and  stimulate  the  imagination  of  thestudents.  He  was  a  great  believer  in  thestudy  of  architecture,  recog-nising its  value  as  fundamental  to  the  work  of  a  sculptor,  designer,or  decorator,  and  he  advocated  the  practice  of  each  student  spend-ing ayear  under  Professor  Beresford  Pite,  F.R.I.B.A., Professor  ofArchitecture,  whose  teaching  he  considered  invaluable."Deeply  absorbed  ashewasintheSchoolofPainting,everybranchof  the  College  work  came  in  for  a  share  of  his  sympathetic  interest.The  Embroidery  Class  had  a  great  attraction  for  him,  and  he  wasalways  welcomed  as  an  admirer  and  encourager  of  the  craft."With  all  his  fine  feeling  he  was  eminently  practical;  his  sugges-tions as  to  how  the  work  of  the  College  could  be  brought  to  bearupon  those  industries  of  the  country  which  were  dependent  uponart  for  their  success  were  always  welcomed  and  were  much  valuedby  the  staff  of  the  College . ' 'Two  extracts  from  Abbey's  own  writing  on  the  subject  of  muraldecoration  will  make  his  position  as  an  instructor  even  more  clear.From  one  of  the  annual  reports  drawn  up  by  him  is  this  passage:  "Adecorative  painting  presupposes  a  place  to  be  decorated,  and  thisplace  has  a  shape,  size  and  architectural  surroundings.  It  is,  there-fore, indispensable  in  all  decorative  painting  that  these  be  exactlystated  and  thoroughly  understood  before  the  colour  composition  isundertaken,  and  herein  lies  the  problem  for  the  pupil.  His  subjectmust  be  designed  with  reference  to  these.  When,  therefore,  theshape,  size,  and  architectural  surroundings  are  not  given  with  thesubject    there  is  no  decorative  problem  for  the  pupil  to  work  out,and  his  painting  becomes  merely  an  easel  picture."4 3 8DECORATIVE  PAINTINGAnd  here  is  a  letter  belonging  to  this  period  on  the  training  of  stu-dents as  decorative  painters: ' '  I  think  that  too  little  attention  is  givenby  students  to  careful — hard  and  fast — constructional  drawing,  andthat  inasmuch  as  drawing  and  black-and-white  design  are  the  mostpermanent  qualities  that  any  decorative  painting  can  have —  care-lessness in  these  particulars  is  likely  to  lead  to  disaster  in  after  life—  if  it  is  permitted  to  become  a  habit.  No  matter  how  fine  a  coloursense  a  young  painter  may  have,  he  will  lose  it  to  a  great  extent  as  hegrows  older."We  know  what  Michael  Angelo's  and  Leonardo's  drawings  anddesigns  are  like — but  we  haven 't  the  slightest  idea  of  what  the  colourmay  have  been  when  it  was  first  painted.  The  colour  ofvery  few  ofthe  pictures  painted  by  the  Old  Masters  is  to-day  at  all  like  the  ori-ginal colour.  Itmaybebetter — or  it  may  notbe  so  good —  butitiscertainly  different.  Furthermore,  apainted  decoration  must  take  itsplace  as  part  of  an  architectural  design  and  the  architectural  settingmust  be  considered  in  making  a  composition.  For  this  reason  apainting  school  should  have  sufficient  space  to  carry  on  the  workthat  is  being  done."Modelled  spaces  should  frequently  be  provided,  perhaps  by  stu-dents of  architecture,  into  which  the  designs  of  the  students  in  theschool  for  painting  should  be  fixed  or  composed ."The  gist  of  what  I  believea  student  should  be  made  to  do  is  tobecareful  in  his  construction,  and  accurate  in  his  drawing,  as  accurateas  is  humanly  possible .    If  he  is  a  colourist  this  won 't  hurt  his  colour—and  if  he  is  not  (and  few  of  them  are),  he  will  have  the  drawing  andcomposition  of  his  design  to  justify  it."I  can  only  speak  of  my  own  practice,  as  my  own  student  dayswere  cut  short,  and  I  had  painfully  to  hark  back  in  later  years."I  don't  remember  who  it  was  who  gave  me  this  invaluable  tip-but  I  think  it  is  wholesome  advice,  and  cheers  up  many  a  dull  day'swork.  This  is  to  try  to  make  the  difficult  part  of  any  drawing,  anystudy,  any  design,  the  most  interesting  thing  in  it."Many  years  ago  Tadema  said  to  me, 'You  are  too  careless  withyour  hands.  Do  as  I  do.  If  you  have  a  small  hand  to  draw,  draw  it439ADVICE  TO  STUDENTSlarge  first— then  draw  it  from  nature  again — in  your  picture.  Youwill  find  you  will  do  it  more  easily.'  I  folio  wed  this  practice  in  myblack-and-white  drawings  for  years — and  I  very  frequently  do  sostill."To  sum  up:  I  am  positive  that  young  students  (they  are  notpushed  by  dates  of  exhibitions,  or  architects,  or  by  hurrying  pub-lishers) ,  should  acquire  while  in  a  school  habits  of  extreme  precisionand  accuracy.  A  student  of  everything  else  must  do  this  if  he  is  toamount  to  anything  in  science,  literature,  in  anything  in  fact — andit  is  nothing  less  than  disastrous  for  a  young  man  to  begin  his  careerby  allowing  himself  to  be  slovenly  and  inaccurate.  The  hasty  sketchof  a  man  who  has  studied  patiently  and  closely  is  worth  something—but  the  slop  of  an  uncultivated  youth  has  no  value  whatever."I  have  always  looked  upon  my  profession  as  a  serious  one — alearned  profession  in  which  one  is  constantly  sifting  and  eliminatingand  adapting  his  knowledge  and  experience  to  its  innumerable  pur-poses and  requirements."And  now,  to  return  again  to  Abbey's  letter  to  Mr. Johnson,  wecome  to  a  very  interesting  passage  from  which  some  idea  may  begained  of  the  incessant  and  minute  toil  that,  when  the  artist  is  sin-cere, lurks  concealed  behind  the  smiling  hues  of  such  decorations  asthese.  "As  you,  of  course,  know,  the  kast  part  of  the  labour  be-stowed upon  work  of  this  magnitude  is  the  labour  of  putting  thesettled  designs  upon  thefinal  large  canvas.  The  greatest  part  of  thelabour  is  not  represented  by  what  the  sp  ectator  sees  upon  the  canvas ,but  rather  by  what  he  does  not  see  there,  for  before  the  canvas  istouched  an  exhaustive  study  of  the  subject  in  hand  must  be  made.If  the  subject  is  representative  of  modern  science  and  labour,  theremust  be  careful  study  of  machinery,  and  of  the  workers  and  theirsurroundings.  If  the  subjects  are  historical,  all  the  necessary  litera-ture must  be  collected  and  read  and  sifted  and  a  study  of  the  dressand  manners  of  the  period  must  be  made;  the  necessary  costumesand  other  objects  and  all  the  data  bearing  upon  the  subject  mustbe  acquired;  and,  finally ,  when  a  design  has  been  settled  upon  andmade  (a  design  suited  to  the  shape,  size  and  position  of  the  space4 4 0HARRISBURG  DECORATIONSto  be  decorated)  elaborate  separate  drawings  and  studies  must  bemade  of  each  figure  and  object,  before  the  first  canvas  is  begun."If  after  all  this  preparation  a  design  had  been  prepared  for  a  space20  feet  by  8  feet,  and  this  space  is  afterwards  altered  to  a  space  9  feetby  10  feet  or  vice  versa,  it  is  obvious  that  the  design  cannot  fit  thenew  space— is,  probably ,  not  suitable  for  a  space  so  wholly  differentin  shape,  and,  consequently,  even  if  the  final  canvas  has  not  beentouched,  a  great  part  of  the  preceding  labour  has  been  lost  and  thetime  and  nervous  force  of  the  artist  wasted,  for  a  new  design  mustbe  made  suited  to  (fitted  to)  the  shape  of  the  new  space."I  have  tried  to  avoid  all  mention  of  the  technical  difficulties  al-most insurmountable  (the  relation  of  lines  to  spaces,  questions  ofscale  and  proportion)  which  arise  when  one  is  called  upon  to  makecompositions,  designed  for  certain  spaces,  fit  other  spaces  of  otherproportions."Abbey's  assistant,  Mr.  Board,  is  very  interesting  on  the  Harris-burg  methods:  "His  process  of  evolving  each  subject,  started  per-haps with  the  merest  pencil  sketch  in  a  sketch  book  or  a  small  oilstudy;  this  would  pass  through  various  phases  of  elimination  orrefining,  often  with  the  help  of  little  groups  of  mannikins  set  up,arranged  and  re-arranged  until  the  required  composition  was  ob-tained. Then  careful  studies  of  each  figure  were  done  in  charcoal,pastel,  or  paint  from  the  living  model — they  were  then  generallysquared  off  on  to  the  canvas,  but  in  the  case  of  the  Pennsylvaniadecoration  he  introduced  a  new  idea.  In  that  case  he  had  the  studiesphotographed  and  turned  into  lantern  slides.  Then,  in  the  even-ings, when  the  main  lines  of  the  composition  were  fixed  on  the  bigcanvas  and  the  position  of  each  figure  lightly  indicated,  each  studywould  be  thrown  on  it  and  manoeuvred  into  its  correct  place-which ,when  done,  the  outlines  would  be  fixed  on  the  canvas  with  charcoal.Each  figure  was  treated  in  the  same  way  until  the  whole  compositionwas  completed .  Mr .  Abbey  found  this  plan  much  more  expeditiousthan  the  usual'squaring  off'  for  large  canvases.  Following  that,the  whole  composition  was  painted  in  monochrome  and  finally  incolour,  always  with  the  aid  of  the  studies  and  the  model  posing.144ABBEY  AT  WORKI  [have  seen  him  sometimes  at  work  practically  surrounded,  withcanvas  in  front,  model  posing  on  one  side  in  costume,  close  bythe  lay  figure  similarly  posed  and  in  similar  costume,  and  pinnedup  in  all  directions  on  boards  and  easels,  numbers  of  studies  forthesame  figure.  Due  to  shortsightedness,  he  always  worked  close  tohis  model."Mr.  Simmonds  also  has  something  to  say  of  the  great  Harrisburgoperations:  "An  incident  which  displayed  his  great  dexterity  hap-pened while  we  were  enlarging  the  figures  (9  feet  high)  on  the '  Steel-Workers'  Lunette.  We  marked  the  height  of  one  of  the  figures,  andthe  study  was  put  down  beside  the  canvas;  he  then  took  one  of  thelong-handled  brushes  which  we  were  using  for  the  work,  and  witha  full  brush  started  at  the  back  of  the  neck  and  drew  the  line  of  theback  of  the  figure  down  to  the  heel,  quickly,  without  a  break.  Thewhole  figure  was  then  finished  by  the  usual  method  of  enlarging  bysquaring,  and  the  back  line  was  found  to  be  exactly  right  and  re-mained the  outline  of  the  figure. ' '"If,  therefore,"  Abbey's  letter  to  Mr.  Johnson  concludes,  "mywork  has  not  advanced  as  rapidly  as  I  had  hoped  and  expected,  Ithink  I  may  say  that  this  is  not  due  to  any  negligence  or  lack  of  zealon  my  part,  and  if  the  authorities  of  the  State  will  have  patience,  theState,  in  return,  shall  have  the  best  work  that  my  powers  are  capableof  producing,  and  at  the  earliest  moment  possible,  for  I  shall  allownothing  over  which  I  have  control  to  interfere  with  this  work  for  mynative  State."-  -Theforegoing  letter,  with  its  bewildering  record  ofenergy  and  productiveness,  does  not,  however,  tell  all  that  Abbeyhad  been  doing  for  the  Capitol.  In  addition  to  his  own  painting,and  in  addition  to  the  work  contracted  for,  he  had,  at  the  requestof  the  architect,  made  designs  for  all  the  architectural  ornamentrequired  for  the  walls  and  ceilings,  and  had  supplied  the  colourschemes  for  the  House  of  Representatives  and  for  the  Senate.  Al-though it  involved  much  extra  labour  and  a  vast  number  of  designs,incorporating  the  arms  and  emblems  of  the  State,  he  felt  that  anadvantage  was  gained  for  his  paintings  by  a  setting  of  his  own  de-vising, besides  adding  greatly  to  the  magnificence  and  beauty  of  the4 4 2U'j  ll»rp«r  &  BrotLeri.HARRISBURG  DECORATIONSchambers.  The  relief  was  in  gold.  The  colour  for  the  House  of  Re-presentatives was  a  rich  dark  blue,  and  the  same  colour  as  the  back-ground of  his  24  feet  circular  ceiling, "The  Hours."  And  when,after  Abbey's  death,  his  ceiling,  "The  Hours,"  was  set  in  place,  40feet  or  more  above  the  floor,  it  melted  perfectly  into  its  surround-ings, and  the  chamber  became  the  harmonious  whole  which  he  hadstriven  to  make  it.  The  scheme  for  the  Senate  was  gold  relief  orna-ment, with  green  for  background.The  style  chosen  by  Abbey  for  the  House  of  Representatives  wasItalian  Renaissance,  and  for  the  Senate  French  Renaissance.  Incom-plete as  his  Harrisburg  work  is —  with  the  long  frieze  in  the  SenateChamber  not  begun — there  is  enough  there  not  only  to  astonish  thevisitor  by  its  beauty,  abundance,  and  power, but  to  link  the  artist'sfame  for  ever  with  it.Abbey  had  no  cricket  in  1907.  At  the  end  of  the  summer  he  indul-ged in  a  little  house-hunting —  made  necessary  by  the  fact  that  Mor-gan Hall  could  not  be  purchased;  and  on  September  1 6th,  after  thebriefest  of  inspections,  he  bought  Woodcote  Manor,  then  the  homeof  the  late  Sir  Francis  Seymour  Haden,  the  surgeon  and  etcher — arambling  edifice,  chiefly  Jacobean,  as  remote  from  towns  as  Abbeyli  k  ed ,  and  lending  itself  to  extension .  The  house  stands  high  amongwoods  and  pasture  land  in  a  park  of  forty  acres  in  that  great  sparselypopulated  district  between  Alton  and  Winchester.  It  is  a  part  ofthe  village  of  Bramdean;  the  nearest  town  is  Alresford;  the  neareststations  are  West  Meon  and  Ropley .  All  kinds  of  alterations  and  im-provements were  to  be  made  under  Abbey 's  direction  in  the  follow-ing years,  but  he  himself  was  not  destined  to  live  there.From  a  letter  or  so  written  by  Seymour  Haden,  the  life-tenantof  Woodcote,  to  the  new  owner  I  take  some  particulars  of  the  pro-perty :  "It  is  a  matter  of  agreeable  surprise  to  me  to  learn  that  anartist  so  distinguished  as  yourself  is  to  become  the  ultimate  pos-sessor of  one  of  the  most  interesting  houses  I  have  ever  seen,  thoughI  do  not  know  and  have  not  the  least  idea  when  and  on  what  termsyou  are  to  become  its  ultimate  possessor,  and  shall  be  glad  of  anyinformation  you  can  give  me  on  that  point,  inasmuch  as  two  lives443WOODCOTE  MANORmust  drop  before  that  can  be,  my  own  age  being  ninety  and  LadyHaden's  eighty-one.""...  Comparatively  few  alterations  will  carry  it  back  to  the  timeof  Elizabeth ,  when  the  present  house  was  built,  and  the  many  traceswhich  still  exist  of  what  it  was  in  the  time  of  the  Bishop  of  Blois,  abrother  of  the  Conqueror.  ..."Sir  Seymour  went  on  to  congratulate  Abbey  on  undertaking  sovast  and  novel  a  task  as  his  Harrisburg  decorations,  remarking  thatrarely  did  a  successful  Royal  Academician  break  new  ground  so  ad-venturously.Abbey  began  in  1907  "The  Education  of  Isabella  the  Catholic,"an  oil  painting  7  feet  6  inches  by  4  feet  4  inches.  Isabella  is  seenpassing  through  a  cloister  of  the  nunnery  at  Arevalo,  where  she  wasbrought  up,  wearing  over  her  blue  and  gold  patterned  dress  a  short,sleeveless ,  heraldic,  silk  mantle ,  red  and  gold ,  white  and  black ,  b  ear-ing the  arms  of  Leon  and  Castile  quarterly ,  and,  as  she  moves  along,listening  to  the  Abbess  at  her  side,  who  is  reading  to  her  from  abreviary.  Following  close  upon  them,  coming  down  a  staircase,  is  acompany  of  nuns,  each  bearing  in  her  hands  an  educational  objectof  the  period.  This  Gothic  picture,  date  about  1463 ,  not  quite  fin-ished when  Abbey  died,  was  exhibited  at  the  Royal  Academy  in  thefollowing  spring,  1912.We  now  enter  the  year  1908,  the  first  letter  to  be  quoted  dealingwith  asubjectthatwas  always  very  close  to  Abbey 'sheart — theques-tion  of  the  import  duty  in  America  on  works  of  art.  We  have  alreadyseen  him  remonstrating  with  John  Hay  on  this  matter.  In  answer  toa  letter  from  Mr.  Myron  Pierce,  the  secretary  of  the  American  FreeArt  League,  asking  him  for  a  statement  of  his  views,  he  writes  :"Mv  DEAE  SIR,  "February  3rd,  1908."  It  is  difficult  to  think  of  anything  new  to  say  in  favour  of  the  re-moval of  the  duty  upon  works  of  art.' '  I  have  always  supposed  that  industries  in  the  United  States  wereprotected  in  order  to  foster  these  industries.  But  in  the  case  of  a  taxupon  foreign  works  of  art,  far  from  fostering  the  home  product,  thistax  does  it  the  greatest  possible  injury.444ANOTHER  PROTEST"An  atmosphere  of  art  is  the  breath  of  life  to  the  artist.  Withoutit  he  can  neither  flourish  nor  grow — and  how  can  there  be  an  atmo-sphere of  art  in  a  country  which  practically  prohibits  the  artists  ofall  other  countries  from  sending  their  work  to  that  country — thusdestroying  the  possibility  of  that  ingathering  from  the  whole  worldof  all  the  best  and  latest  thoughts,  which  would  help  to  produce  theart  atmosphere  in  which  alone  the  arts  can  flourish  ?"Artists,  as  a  rule,  are  not  capitalists,  and  to  send  their  work  toAmerica  before  it  is  sold,  and  pay  the  heavy  duty  demanded,  is,as  a  rule,  too  great  a  speculation  for  them  to  venture  upon.  Con-sequently, the  Parisian  dealers,  who  are  capitalists,  but  not  artists,are  the  speculators  who  decide  what  pictures  shall  and  what  shall  notenter  the  United  States — and  their  selection  does  not  depend  uponthe  artistic  quality  of  the  pictures,  but  upon  those  qualities  which,in  their  judgment,  make  the  pictures  saleable.'  'American  artists  and  their  work  are  so  lib  erally  receiv  ed  and  hos-pitably treated  by  all  other  countries,  that  it  is  a  matter  of  chagrinand  embarrassment  to  me  that  laws  are  made  by  my  countrymenwhich  keep  the  work  of  artists  of  other  countries  out  of  the  UnitedStates— laws  which  hamper  our  own  artists  and  benefit  nobody  else ."I  am,  dear  Sir,"Very  faithfully  yours,"EDWIN  A.  ABBEY."In  the  spring  of  1908  certain  of  Abbey's  friends  and  colleagueshad  an  opportunity  of  seeing  what  he  had  been  doing  for  his  nativeState,  for  the  Vice-Chancellor  of  the  University  of  London,  havingbeen  approached  through  the  Royal  College  of  Art  at  South  Ken-sington, the  East  Gallery  of  the  University  was  lent  to  the  artist  forfive  weeks ,  from  March  1 8th ,  for  a  semi-private  exhibition  of  eight  ofthe  Harrisburg  paintings,  before  their  despatch  to  America.  Writ-ing to  Walter  James  on  March  i3th  Abbey  says :  "I'm  bringing  mymagnii  opii — I  suppose  that  is  what  they  would  be  termed — up  tothe  Imperial  Institute,  Univ.  of  London,  next  week  as  ever  is,  and  Iam  getting  clean  tuckered-out,  and  am  feeling  sore  let  and  hinderedin  running  the  race  that  is  set  before  me.  .  .  .  Sorry  we  missed  theVOL.  n. — N  445A  HARRISBURG  EXHIBITIONSicilians — I  wanted  to  see  the  man  [the  famous  Grassi]  chew  theother  man's  windpipe,  and  am  much  disappointed."  The  'magniiopii"  were  the  four  lunettes  and  the  four  circular  canvases  for  thependentives  as  described  above  in  the  letter  to  Mr.  Johnson.  Theexhibition  was  of  intense  interest  to  those  who  saw  it :  a  new  reve-lation of  Abbey 's  vigour  and  genius.  Among  those  who  came  to  seethe  paintings  were  the  King  and  the  Queen  and  many  other  mem-bers of  the  Royal  Family.Abbey's  work  on  this  portion  of  his  task  was  not  done  until  theeight  paintings  were  packed.  It  was  then  that — literally — the  fin-ishing touches  were  given,  for  with  his  own  brush  (as  the  Londoncorrespondent  of  the  New  York  Sun  amusingly  described)  the  ar-tist, "a  well-attired  smiling  little  man  in  a  silk  hat,  holding  in  hisleft  hand  a  large  jampot,"  painted  on  the  vast  case  the  simple  di-rection "To  the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania."  His  mind  re-mained ill  at  ease  until  on  May  3oth  came  a  cablegram  from  Phil-adelphia containing  the  single  word  "Safe."The  decorations  were  quickly  set  in  place,  and  from  an  article  byMr .  Royal  Cortissoz ,  which  app  eared  in  Scribner  's Magazine  f or  D e-cember,  1908, afewpassages  may  bequotedhere.  The  writer  beginswith  a  survey  of  the  artist's  career.  Coming  to  his  latest  work,  hesays:"They  are  placed  midway  between  the  drum  of  thegreat  dome  andthe  massive  piers  supporting  the  whole  structure.  The  lunettes  arerecessed  well  back  of  the  curving  line  followed  by  the  pendentives,and  the  ceilings  of  thearches,  enclosing  thelargerpaintingsare richlycoffered.  The  imposing  cornice  superimposed  upon  the  piers  formsa  perfect  base  for  Mr.  Abbey's  decorative  scheme.  He  has  been,  in-deed, very  fortunate  in  his  architectural  environment.  Classical  instyle,  it  has  been  handled  with  a  due  sense  of  dignity  and  no  thin  orfrivolous  details  have  been  admitted .  White  marble  rules  below  thecornice ,  save  where  the  capitals  are  bright  with  gold .  In  the  corniceitself,  and  in  the  conventional  ornament  on  the  pendentives  aroundthe  artist's  panels,  blue  is  added  to  the  arrangement  of  white  andgold.  The  general  effect  is  reposeful  and  cool.  Mr.  Abbey  has  madehis  work  a  very  harmonious  part  of  it    "4 4 6ANJEEARINGNCJFINOWLSN  ESS1VWELLDCEAND*NG~  .-r.  ••*\/HARRISBURG  DECORATIONSAgain:  "Regains  hisend  by  a  right  adjustment  of  masses,  by  adis-creet  arrangement  of  colours  as  well  as  of  forms.  This  is  manifest  atonce  when  the  observer  enters  the  main  portal  on  the  east  side  of  thebuilding  and  is  confronted  by  'The  Spirit  of  Religious  Liberty ,'  farup  on  the  western  wall .  There  is  no  crassly  fixed  centre  here ,  but  thedesign  is  beautifully  unified .  Across  the  bottom  of  it  stretches  a  nar-row strip  of  deep  blue  sea.  Narrow  as  it  is,  it  has  enormous  weight;smoothly  but  irresistibly  you  feel  the  pressure  of  an  illimitable  bodyof  water.  The  foam  rises,  subtly  suggesting  the  deep  snore  of  thesea  itself,  under  the  forefoot  of  the  nearest  vessel.  The  ocean  moves,it  is  alive  with  its  colour,  its  sound,  and  its  sharp,  salt  smell.  Mr.Abbey  has  done  nothing  truer  or  more  artistic  than  he  has  donehere,  painting  the  sea  as  it  is  and  at  the  same  time  making  it  a  sort  ofpedestal  for  the  intensely  decorative  ships  that  tower  above  it.  Thebroad  sails  relieve  the  dark  hulls  with  breadths  of  tawny  red .  Some-thing of  their  glow  faintly  flushes  with  rose  the  white  draperies  ofthe  three  celestial  guides.  Back  of  it  all  is  a  cloudless  sky,  vague,opalescent  spacious.  Filled  with  the  large  airs  of  the  open  sea,  elo-quent of  the  wide  horizons  faced  by  the  founder  and  his  people,  isthis  beautiful  painting,  a  work  to  touch  the  imagination  with  a  senseof  an  old  hope  gloriously  fulfilled.  And,  withal,  the  lunette  fallsinto  its  place  as  naturally,  with  as  much  of  architectural  balance,  asthough  its  component  parts  had  been  mathematically  assembled."Thesamewell-ponderedconstructionmarkstheeasternlunette,'  Science  Revealing  [the]  Treasures  of  the  Earth. '  The  red  earth  it-self provides  the  firm  foundation  in  this  case,  synthetised,  like  thesea  in  the  other,  into  a  simple,  broad  mass.  The  deep  fissures  in  itare  only  dimly  discerned.  The  miners  are  descending  warily  intounknown  depths  and ,  accordingly ,  these  are  enveloped  in  the  gloomof  mystery.  The  practically  nude  bodies  of  the  workmen  are  notpainted  in  too  high  relief.  These  d  elvers  are  coming  close  to  MotherEarth  with  primitive  toil  and  their  skins  are  subdued  in  colour  to  thestuff  they  work  in.  One  is  aware  of  them  as  stalwart,  yet  young  andartless  creatures,  obviously  the  builders  of  a  new  world,  eager  uponthe  scent  of  discovery.  Whether  intentional  or  not,  the  treatment  of447HARRISBURG  DECORATIONSthe  tree-trunks  behind  them  is  singularly  suggestive  in  view  of  theallegorical  figures  rilling  the  upper  part  of  the  canvas  on  the  otherside.  The  russet- winged  Goddess  of  Fortune  in  her  red  robe,  drift-ing over  the  abyss  between  Abundance  and  Science  (Minerva,  theGoddess  of  Wisdom)  with  their  thin,  floating  draperies  respectivelyof  blue  and  white,  looms  against  a  bright  sky  like  a  phantom  out  ofthe  pagan  mythology.  She  sets  the  mind  momentarily  on  thoughtsof  classical  antiquity,  and,  keyed  to  this  mood,  the  bare  tree-trunksraise  a  fleeting  memory  of  some  pillared  Greek  temple.  Betweenthese  natural  columns  you  catch  glimpses  of  distant  blue  hills.  Theair  seems  very  still.  The  explorers  work  as  in  a  breathless  wonder,tense  with  the  excitement  of  uncovering  a  precious  secret  in  one  ofthe  silent  places  of  the  world .  Both  in  this  and  in  the  decoration  tra-versed above,  Mr.  Abbey  links  his  design  with  the  deeds  of  the  menwho  made  Pennsylvania,  and  generalises  his  theme  so  that  it  has  awider  scope.  He  lifts  his  local  allusion  to  the  plane  of  his  purpose  asthe  collaborator  of  the  architect."The  northern  and  southern  lunettes,  conceived  with  equal  im-aginative grasp,  are,  nevertheless,  designed  in  such  wise  as  to  bringmore  realistically  home  to  us  a  sense  of  what  Pennsylvania  is  doingto-day  with  the  liberty  sought  in  those  red-sailed  ships  and  with  thetreasures  wrung  from  the  earth .  The  hammer-wielding  god  in  'TheSpirit  of  Vulcan'  wears  his  scanty  blue  garment  after  the  carelessfashion  of  the  Olympians  and  his  ruddy  limbs  and  shoulders  restappropriately  in  cloudy  billows.  But  he  broods  over  the  scene  lessas  a  poetic  figure  than  as  the  mentor  and  friend  of  the  very  humantoilers  beneath  him.  He  seems,  in  very  truth,  the  genius  of  the  am-azing chamb  er  in  which  he  finds  himself,  a  place  of  giant  mach  inery ,dark,  fantastic,  and  forbidding,  of  molten  metal  and  eddying  va-pours, of  grimy  sweating  men  who  are  children  of  this  generation,but  who,  at  their  mighty  task,  wear  somehow,  a  grander,  more  ele-mentalair.  The  management  of  the  colour  in  this  decoration  is  sup-erb, the  prevailing  darkness  of  the  machinery  being  relieved  to  justthe  right  extent  by  the  warm  flesh  tints  of  the  smiths,  the  glow  of  theflaming  steel,  the  pearly  tones  of  the  shifting  steam  and  the  touch  of4 4 8ftHARRISBURG  DECORATIONSlovely  blue  in  Vulcan's  tunic.  But  one  dwells  also  with  special  ap-preciation on  the  modelling  and  draughtsmanship  which  the  artisthas  brought  to  the  portrayal  of  his  figures.  The  linear  habit  properto  his  illustrations  made  with  the  pen,  and  subsequently  hinted,  ifnot  actually  disclosed,  in  some  of  his  paintings,  is  here  conclusivelyabandoned.  The  figures  are  seen  in  the  round  and  are  so  painted,freely  and  boldly,  with  close  research  into  movement,  the  play  ofmuscle  and  the  swiftly  changing  effects  of  light  and  shade.  Nor  hasthe  painter's  interest  in  detail  distracted  him  unduly.  He  fuses  hisdetails  into  one  moving  vision."Up  to  this  point  Mr.  Abbey  has  worked,  so  to  say ,  on  safe  ground.In  his  fourth  lunette,  he  lets  himself  go  in  rather  audacious  vein.Baldly  stated  on  paper,  the  idea  of  a  company  of  light  bearers  rush-ing up  into  the  air,  past  the  prosaic  timbers  raised  above  a  numberof  oil-wells,  hardly  commends  itself  as  suitable  for  a  great  mural  de-coration. It  all  depends,  of  course,  upon  how  the  thing  is  done.  Mr.Abbey  does  it  with  success  by  concentrating  his  attention  upon  theinherentpicturesqueness  of  his  subject.  He  sees  that  subject  againsta  dark  sky,  the  deep  blue  of  which  is  broken  by  rifts  of  gold.  Withsuch  a  background  the  black  tracery  of  his  derricks  takes  on  a  newaspect;  it  is  no  longer  prosaic  but,  on  the  contrary,  positively  roman-tic. One  thinks  of  the  tall  chimneys  on  Thames-side  which  turnedinto  campanili  under  Whistler's  eyes .  The  derricks  have  somethingbizarre  about  them;  beneath  the  shadow  of  those  ghostly  towers,almost  anything  might  happen,  and  there  is,  after  all,  not  audacityalone,  but,  in  some  sort,  an  inevitableness  in  the  sudden  upwardflightof  the*  Spiritsof  Light, 'golden-haired, ivory-tinted  goddesses,swathed  in  diaphanous  blue,  and  coming  like  exhalations  from  thedeeps.  The  maze  of  their  floating  figures,  all  softness  and  grace,would  lose  half  its  value  against  a  neutral  background.  The  neededcontrast,  the  element  to  make  the  balance  true,  comes  from  the  rigidlines  of  the  derricks.  The  eye  rests  upon  this  lunette  with  the  samecontentment  as  upon  its  companions."If  the  four  have,  as  it  were,  a  common  vitality,  expressed  inthe  same  terms,  their  decorative  integrity,  as  of  work  growing  out449HARRISBURG  DECORATIONSof  the  construction  of  the  walls,  is  in  part  supported  by  the  medal-lions in  the  pendentives.  These  unite  while  they  divide  the  can-vases to  which  they  are  subordinate.  They  are  necessary  membersof  the  scheme,  embracing  Mr.  Abbey's  zone  of  the  rotunda  in  onechord  of  colour.  In  them  he  has  sought  to  create  four  episodes  ofdesign  without  so  far  emphasising  them  as  to  give  them  an  inde-pendent existence.  To  this  end  he  causes  the  figures  to  stand  outagainst  golden  backgrounds  so  that  each  medallion  counts  vividlyin  the  ensemble,  but  none  of  these  personifications  is  invested  withtoo  complicated  a  meaning.  Religion,  clad  in  the  white  robe  of  in-nocence and  treading  underfoot  the  dragon  of  evil,  stands  with  armsuplifted  between  her  altar  and  the  torch  with  which  she  passes  onthe  sacred  flame.  Law,  in  heavy  red  habiliments,  is  blindfolded,but  she,  too,  has  conquered  the  enemy  at  her  feet.  In  one  hand  shebears  the  scales  and  in  the  other  a  sword .  The  owl  of  wisdom  percheson  the  wrist  of  Science,  whose  right  hand  holds  the  lightning.  Theserpent  coiled  beneath  the  hem  of  her  garment  lifts  its  head  aboveher  knee.  Her  face  is  veiled.  Religion  and  Law  are  tall,  solemn,hieratic  figures.  Science  is  made  more  human.  She  is  the  mostbeautiful  of  the  four.  Her  robes  are  bewitching  in  colour,  agleamwith  the  deep  greens  of  the  emerald  and  the  hues  of  a  dark  Egyptianscarab.  .  .  ."Mr.Cortissoz  thus  sums  up  his  survey:  "When  all  is  said,  it  is,  infact,  the  swift,  sweeping  view  of  Mr.  Abbey's  decorations  that  im-poses the  severest  test.  How  do  they  bear  the  scrutiny  that  takes  little,if  any,  account  of  their  meaning  but  looks  simply  to  their  organicfitness  in  the  place  in  which  they  are  fixed?  They  bear  it  trium-phantly and,  what  is  more,  they  will  not  let  you  neglect  their  mean-ing. That  is  because  Mr.  Abbey  has  perfectly  balanced  substanceand  form.  His  idea  in  each  decoration  is  set  forthwith  simplicity.There  is  no  surplusage  as  there  is  no  obscurity.  In  the  same  momentin  which  you  apprehend  the  beauty  he  has  put  into  his  designs-beauty  of  form,  colour,  and  composition — you  realise  his  thought.It  is  important  to  observe,  too,  that  he  has  placed  his  scheme  in  theright  perspective.  It  is  interesting  to  study  it  from  the  successive4 5 °THNGSFOKEV&MEMBER  OF  THE  "INSTITUT"galleries  which,  at  the  topmost  stage,  permit  it  to  be  pretty  closelyexamined.  But  it  is  seen  at  its  best  from  the  pavement,  when  thebeholder  is  thinking  of  no  single  detail  in  the  rotunda,  but  surveysat  a  glance  all  that  lies  within  his  line  of  vision.  At  that  momentMr.Abbey's  decorations  seem  to  him  as  necessary  to  the  building  as  thegiant  piers  around  him  or  the  floor  on  which  he  stands."The  Pilgrims,  the  cordial  Anglo-American  confederacy,  madethe  Imperial  Institute  Exhibition  an  occasion  to  give  a  luncheon  inthe  painter's  honour,  on  May  iath.  His  figure  of  Art  was  used  onthe  cover  of  the  list  of  guests,  and  the  American  Ambassador,  Mr.Whitelaw  Reid,  was  well  enough  to  preside.  The  speech  of  welcomewas  made  by  Alma  Tadema,  in  which  he  described  their  guest  as"more  than  anybody  the  pre-eminent  link  between  America  andEngland . ' '  Abbey 's  reply  is  quoted  from  in  earlier  chapters ,  as  it  hadsome  valuable  autobiographical  details.A  letter  to  his  old  friend  William  Laffan,  on  May  i6th,  tells  of  an-other honour  which  had  just  fallen  to  him.  "Say,  I'm  a  corres-ponding member  of  the '  Ansteytoo'  in  place  of  Bompiani  of  Rome,who  deceded  last  year.  ...  I  seem  to  be  a  good  deal  of  a  cuss."Translated  into  English,  this  means  that  on  May  2nd,  the  secretaryof  the  Academic  des  Beaux  Arts,  Institut  de  France,  informed  Mon-sieur Abbey  that  he  had  been  elected  as  a  corresponding  member  inplace  of  the  late  Robert  Bompiani.  Abbey  was  the  second  Philad  el  -phian  to  receive  this  honour,  Benjamin  Franklin  having  been  thefirst.  A  visit  to  Paris — a  necessary  corollary — followed,  of  whichsomething  was  said  in  a  letter  to  Mr.  Napier  Hemy.  Among  themembers  of  the  "Institut"  upon  whom  Abbey  called  were  MM.Merson,  Bonnat,  Detaille,  Dagnan-Bouveret  and  Ferriers.A  letter  toDr.Whitein  September  shows  Abbey  at  work  onPenn'sTreaty  with  the  Indians,  for  Harrisburg:  "You  would  be  interested(I  hope)  to  see  Penn.  I  have  got  the  whole  thing  painted  in — all  theeasy  part.  The  nerve-exhausting  buttons  and  finger  nails —  andchasing  the  model's  nose  round  the  corner —  and  getting  the  actionof  his  back  before  his  spine  sags — these  are  to  come. "  As  for  the  treebeneath  which  the  Indians  assembled,  there  was,  and  is,  ontheout-154A  NORFOLK  HOLIDAYskirts  of  the  Morgan  Hall  cricket  field ,  a  gigantic  elm  that  might  havegrown  for  the  purpose.  Abbey  adds  (not  too  seriously)  apropos  ofa  mutual  acquaintance  of  earlier  days:  "Folks  develop  differentlysometimes  from  what  you  expect  they  will.  But  old  times  are  oldtimes.  I'm  very  glad  I  do  not  fall  below  the  expectations  of  any  ofmy  friends — but  rather  surprise  them  the  other  way.  I'm  sorry  tosay  that  many  of  my  old  friends  do  things  I  don't  like.  I  don't  seehow  they  can — but  they  do."A  letter  to  Walter  James  on  October  6th  tells  of  a  little  holiday  -the  only  one  that  Abbey  was  able  to  take  this  year,  which  also  had  nocricket  for  him.  "Last  week  we  motored  overto  the  Norfolk  coast-byway  of  Brackley,  Cambridge,  Bury  St.  Edmunds,  and  Norwich—stopping  nights  at  Cambridge  and  Norwich.  Then  to  Cromerand  along  the  coast  to  Stiffkey    It  is  a  wonderful  country  for  skiesand  air  and  things — wonderful  old  churches,  and  splendid  subjects.We  had  a  glorious  day  on  the  beach  at  Salthouse —  nothing  in  sightbut  sea  and  sky  and  shingle —  and  nobody  within  miles  save  our-selves. I  believe  the  shooting  issplendid.  I  saw  more  partridges  thanI  knew  existed — and  on  the  marshes  there  were  hundreds  of  wildbirds.  I'd  like  to  go  up  there  and  paint —  before  I  die.  I  wonder  ifyou  know  it  at  all."We  left  with  regret  byway  of  Wells  along  more  coast  to  King'sLynn,  and  thence  to  Ely  across  Fens —  splendid —  I  never  saw  any-thing finer  than  Ely  as  we  came  to  it  in  the  evening  light .  We  shall  dothis  again  one  day.  The  old  car  went  splendidly — and  didn't  swal-low as  much  petrol  as  usual  owing  to  the  absence  of  hills.  .  .  .  Thisnorth  coast  of  Norfolk  is  said  to  be  the  place  Germany  intends  tomake  a  landing  upon.  In  these  days  of  aeroplanes  and  balloons  itwon't  be  so  easy  to  do  it  unbeknownst.  ..' '  My  own  work  has  got  on  pretty  well.  I  Ve  one  big  one  all  rubbedin — 'Penn'sTreaty  with  the  Ingins' — 24feet  high, but, (thank  God!)narrow."  It  was  12  feet  wide.The  military  figures  in  the  great  Apotheosis  decoration,  togetherwith  such  accoutrements  as  might  be  needed  for  "The  Battle  ofGettysburg,"  a  war  picture,  to  follow,  were  now  engaging  Abbey's4 5 2J\ \THE  HOUSE  OF  LORDS  PANELSattention,  and  he  asked  the  assistance  of  Mr.  Shelton,  of  the  Salma-gundi Club ,  to  procure  catalogues  and  to  order  certain  costumes  forhim.  Here  is  a  letter  on  the  subject:  "I  don't  think  I  '11  get  a  cannon.Detaille  has  two  or  three  in  his  backyard — but  I  don't  think  I  can  getenough  juice  out  of  one  to  warrant  importing  it.

They  look  very  different  in  the  cata-logue from  anything  I  see  here.  I  should  have  to  get  in  a  horse  or  two—  as  I  have  only  Jersey  cows  and  dogs,  and  an  automobile  and  somewheel-barrows."Another  task  begun  in  1908  was  the  supervision  by  Abbey  of  aseries  of  six  decorative  historical  paintings  for  the  House  of  Lords.He  settled  the  horizon  line,  the  scale  of  the  figures  and  watched  overthe  harmony  of  the  colour  scheme  and  thus  secured  the  needfulunity  among  the  six  artists  who  were  to  paint  them.  They  were,  aswe  shall  see,  completed  and  set  in  place  in  October,  1910.One  of  the  Jersey  cows  reappears  in  the  last  letter  of  the  yearto  Dr.  White:  "I'm  sorry  to  have  to  report  that  Priscilla  has  lost  herhorns.  She  had  a  difference  with  one  of  her  aunts — and  this  is  theresult.  It  should  be  a  lesson  to  all  of  us.  She  has  had  her  hair  dyedwith  coal  tar — an  excellent  substitute  and  picturesque.  Otherwisewe  are  very  well.

I  note  what  you  say  about  the  figures  in  the  pendentives.  Ihad  my  doubts  about  them,  and  really,  at  first,  made  sketches  ofseated  figures  as  filling  up  the  circles  better;  but  I  thought,  after  Iput  a  small  scale  model  together,  that  standing  figures  carried  theline  of  the  figures  in  the  lunettes  round  better.  I  dare  say  they  are  sofar  apart  that  this  refinement  is  not  noticeable.  What  a  job  it  is,  al-ways! We  learn  all  the  things  we  ought  to  know  to  begin  with — justwhen  we  are  ready  to  step  down  and  out.  There  seem  to  be  no  rulesthat  I  have  ever  been  able  to  come  upon  as  to  scale  or  proportion.  '  Ifa  thing  looks  right  it  is  right' — this  is  a  rule  of  thumb,  but  it  is  aboutthe  only  rule  I  know."In  January  of  this  year  the  Royal  Academy  was  again  suffering  acritical  attack.  Writing  to  Walter  James,  Abbey  says:  "I  sometimeswonder  when  I  read  some  of  these  young  art  critics 'effusions,  whe-ther we  are  all  wrong, and  that  mere'good  paint' — nomatterwhat  itis  supposed  to  indicate  —  is  the  only  thing  in  the  world .  I  'm  too  oldto  change — and  I  still  admire  the  handling  that  expresses  somethingof  the  forms  and  colour  of  what  the  painter  is  looking  at.  If  it  isconscious 'good  paint 'it  is  like  conscious  fine  writing —  and  emptyrhetoric  so  far  as  I'm  concerned.  However,  I  don't  want  to  preach,God  knows  !  I've  just  been  looking  through  John  Hay's  letters-three  vols.,  which  Mrs.  Hay  has  just  sent  us.  The  great  charm  ofthem  is  that  he  don't  preach."At  the  end  of  January ,  the  Abbeys  started  for  Athens  on  a  little  ex-pedition for  the  reasons  for  which  we  must  go  back  to  1908,  when,on  the  3 1  st  of  J  uly ,  Mr .  Ed  ward  Bok ,  of  the  Curtis  Publishing  Com-pany, Philadelphia,  had  written  to  the  artist  telling  him  that  thiscompany  was  about  to  erect  a  nine-storey  building  to  be  entirely"554A  NEW  COMMISSIONdevoted  to  the  uses  of  their  business;  that,  facing  IndependenceSquare,  its  architecture  was  to  harmonise  with  that  of  the  old  StateHouse ,  to  be  Colonial  as  far  as  a  nine-storey  building  would  permit ,and,  like  it,  was  to  be  of  dull  red  brick  with  white  marble  facings,and  that  it  would  take  about  two  years  and  a  half  to  put  up  thebuilding.  He  enclosed  a  plan  of  the  proposed  main  floor,  on  whichwas  shown,  facing  the  principal  entrance,  a  large  wall  space,  andsaid  that  his  company  had  agreed  that  he  should  approach  Abbeywith  the  idea  of  asking  him  if  he  would  accept  a  commission  to  paintfor  them  this  wall  space;  that  if  he  would  consider  doing  this  pieceof  work  for  the  Curtis  Company  he  was  sure  that  they  could  easilycome  to  a  comfortable  working  understanding  on  the  question  of  asingle  panel  or  a  division  of  the  space  into  plural  panels,  as  well  ason  the  question  of  the  subject  of  the  painting  and  the  price.  Heconcluded  his  letter  as  follows:  "Of  course,  I  am  exceedingly  hope-ful that  you  may  be  attracted  to  the  idea  of  doing  this  work  for  us.It  has  always  been  a  matter  of  personal  regret  to  methat  there  shouldbe  no  important  representation  of  your  work  in  Philadelphia  of  allcities.  This  seems  tome  to  be  an  opportunity,  and  I  am  hoping  thatyou  may  consider  it  favourably."Abbey  replied  at  once  saying  that,  although  he  was  at  the  timefully  occupied  upon  the  Harrisburgwork,he  liked  theidea  of  doingsomething  fora  building  in  his  native  city,  but  that  he  would  prefera  single  panel .  He  would ,  he  said ,  b  e  at  Fairf  ord  during  S  eptember .The  result  was  that  Mr .  Bok,  accompanied  by  Mr.  Edgar  V.  Seeler,the  architect  of  the  new  Curtis  Building,  left  America  on  September1 6th,  and  was  at  Morgan  Hall  on  the  23rd.  In  a  few  hours  all  wassettled.  A  design  for  "The  Grove  of  Academe,"  painted  in  oilsyears  before  on  a  wooden  panel,  was  chosen  from  among  severalothers,  and  when  Abbey  had  touched  it  up  a  little,  Mr.  Bok  carriedit  home  to  Philadelphia  to  display  it  to  the  other  members  of  theCurtis  Publishing  Company .  The  painting  was  to  be  a  single  panel,50  feet  by  13  feet.  The  price  agreed  upon,  without  any  discussion,was5O,ooodollars,and  itwas  understood  that  although,fora  changeof  work,  Abbey  might  go  to  Greece  and  make  a  few  studies  there,4 5 6IMPRESSIONS  OF  GREECEhe  could  not  set  up  the  big  canvas  until  the  paintings  for  the  Har-risburg  House  of  Representatives  were  completed.  All  this  hap-pened in  1908,  and  now,  in  January,  1909,  Abbey  found  himselfsufficiently  advanced  with  the  Harrisburg  work  to  be  able  to  visitAthens  and  make  a  few  studies  for  the  panel  for  Philadelphia.We  find  some  notes  on  theGreek  adventure  in  a  letter  to  Dr  .Whitein  March:  "Grease  is  wonderful — a  beautiful  place — with  no  draw-backs save  the  getting  about,  which  is  slow,  and  in  cold  weatheruncomfortable,  and  perhaps,  in  out-of-the-way  places,  the  beds.These  latter  were  invented  by  the  Spartans,  I  dare  say.  We  wentto  Athens — stayed  there  a  couple  of  weeks — then  had  a  dragoman(Constantine  CEconomides  by  name)  who  escorted  us  to  Corinth,Nauplia  for  Epidaurus,  Mycenae,  Tiryns,  Delphi,  Olympia,  etc.—and  did  it  all  well.  Then  we  spent  a  week  at  Corfu — and  after  thathome  by  way  of  Brindisi,  P. &O.  Express.  The  entire  distancethrough  the  length  of  Italy  and  France  through  snow —  I  hope  anunique  experience.  ..."They  are  a  nice,  gentle-voiced  people — the  Greeks —  and  thewomen  are  many  of  them  very  handsome.  We  went  to  a  couple  ofballs  on  the  last  Sunday  we  were  in  Athens.  One,  a  children's  fancy-dress  ball —  at  Mme.  Schliemann's  daughter's  house —  and  anotherwhen  the  Royal  Family  took  a  hand  in  the  festal  scene.  It  struck  meas  a  very  cheery  way  of  spending  the  Sabbath.

The  postscript  of  a  letter  to  Mr.Spiel-mann  on  May  5th,  1909,  is  momentous:  "Just  finished  the  very  lastShakespeare  drawing.  Began  them  twenty  years  ago!"  This  wasthat  of  Cleopatra  saying  to  Antony , ' '  Sooth ,  la ,  I  '11  help :  thus  it  mustbe"-— published  in  Harper's  for  September  of  the  same  year.  Theseries  of  illustrations  to  the  Tragedies  now  brought  to  a  close  had,  aswe  remember,  begun  in  the  magazine  with  King  Lear,  in  1902,  andit  came  to  an  end  in  1 909  with  Titus  Andronicus.  There  were  seventy-one  drawings  in  all  as  against  one  hundred  and  thirty-three  for  theComedies ,  and  now ,  after  a  delay  of  eleven  years ,  the  original  agree-ment with  Messrs.  Harper  and  Bros.,  that  the  Tragedies  and  His-tories should  be  issued  in  an  edition  uniform  with  the  Comedies,  isto  be  carried  out  by  them.In  the  summer  the  portrait  of  Abbey ,  by  Orchardson,  which  servesas  the  frontispiece  to  this  volume,  was  begun  and  finished  as  it  re-mains. Although  Orchardson  was  growing  feeble  in  health,  hishand  retained  its  power,  and  the  picture  is  a  beautiful  one.  Mrs.Abbey  considers  it  a  most  satisfactory  likeness.*  It  was  exhibitedin  the  Academy  in  1910,  but  its  painter  was  not  alive  to  see  it.  ThePresident,  Sir  Edward  Poynter,  in  his  speech  at  the  Royal  AcademyBanquet,  on  April  loth,  1910,  referring  to  the  death  of  Orchardsonand  to  this  portrait,  said :  "He  worked  bravely  till  within  a  few  daysof  his  death,  and,  though  suffering  much  during  the  last  few  yearsof  his  life,  his  work  never  fell  off,  and  I  think  that  the  portrait  of  hisHer  only  criticisms  are  that  his  hair  is  not  dark  enough,  and  that  there  is  a  suggestionin  the  face  that  Abbey  was  a  burlier  man  than  in  reality.458W.  Q.  ORCHARDSONfriend  and  fellow-member,  which  is  in  the  present  exhibition,  willstand  as  one  of  the  best  portraits  he  ever  produced."  The  hands  andobjects  on  the  table  were  left  unfinished,  but  the  signature,  incor-rectly spelled,  was  his  last  stroke  of  work,  done  a  day  or  two  beforehis  death ,The  rest  of  the  year  was  given  to  work  for  Harrisburg,  the  prin-cipal task  being  the  circular  ceiling  and  the  panel  representing  theApotheosis  of  Pennsylvania,  which  meant  enormous  labour  both  ofresearch  and  arrangement .  For  recreation  we  find  the  record  of  onecricket  match,  against  an  Eleven  of  Musicians,  but  no  runs  fromAbbey's  bat;  and  meanwhile  the  motor  car  was  being  more  thanuseful  in  providing  distraction.  In  September  Henry  James  thus  re-fers to  it  in  a  letter  to  Mrs.  Abbey .  "The  idea  of  your  new  noiselessDaimler  solicits  me  more  powerfully  than  I  can  say ,  and  do — oh ,  do\—take  me  two  or  three  such  interesting  spins  as  all  your  countrymakes  possible!  .  .  .  Pardon  my  greedy  frankness;  it  isn't  that  I  love—and — less ,  but  that  I  love  you  and  Daimler  (with  Ned  squeezed  inb  etween  us)  more ! ' 'In  October,  after  attending  the  opening  of  Harvard  House,  Ame-rica's gift  to  Stratford-on-Avon,  the  Abbeys  went  on  a  brief  mo-toring tour  to  Northumberland  to  stay  with  Walter  James,  makinga  stop  here  and  there  to  see  a  cathedral,  the  Roman  Wall,  or  otherobject  of  interest.  Henry  James,  who  chanced  at  the  same  time  tobe  in  Norfolk,  records  some  of  his  impressions  in  a  letter  writtenon  his  return  to  Rye,  on  October  i2th:  "Overstrand  is  a  sort  ofminiature  Norfolk  Newport,  with  a  group  of  people  who  see  each.  .  dining,  tea-ing,  lunching,  or  chatter-other  constantly  all  winter  .ing again  with  the  utmost  fury;  but  the  Norfolk  country  all  new  tome,  full  of  character  and  strength,  and  Norwich  Cathedral  a  muchfiner  thing  than  I  had  supposed.

But  I  cherish  tenderly  your  beautifulbrickless  land  of 'polenta 'yellows."  And  on  November  i2th  hewrites , "  I  had  a  delightful  letter  from  you  on  your  return  from  yourvisit  to  the  Walter  James's ,  which  made  me  envy  you  and  Gertrudeconsumedly,  in  respect  especially  to  all  the  northward  motor-runpreceding  it,  preceding,  I  mean,  your  stay  with  those  so  pleasantpeople  in  those  so  wondrous  wilds  ..  .  and  yet  I  didn't  immediatelythank  you  for  your  so  vivid  picture  of  it  all,  so  as  not  to  have  theair  of  giving  you  tit  for  tat,  in  order  to  obtain  from  you  tat  for  tit!...  I  see  your  monument  [referring  to  Harrisburg  work]  more  andmore  bristle  and  flash ,  more  and  more  splendidly  flourish .

But  it  isn'twell  to  do  nudes  in  the  winter.  Flesh  is  better  to  look  at — and  evento  go  about  in — when  it  is  warmer.  It's  pearlier  and  more  delicate."(Theladieswere"TheHours.")Referringtoanewbookonpainters,by  a  critic,  he  adds:  "I  dare  say  if  these  art  writers  knew  more  aboutwhat  they  write  about  they  wouldn't  write.  No  matter  what — I  shallstick  to  what  I  set  out  to  do,  in  spite  of  fashion.  I  must  see  how  myway  is  coming  out.  Perhaps  it  has  come  out  already — and  that  thereis  nothing  else  left — but  I  see  miles  farther  than  I  can  do,  and  if  Iever  learn  to  refine  what  I  have  laboriously  learned  and  unlearnedI  shall  be  content.  I  shall  have  to  be,  I  suppose.  We  usually  knowhow  we  should  have  played  the  ball  that  got  us  out— after  theevent."I  hear  that  J.S.S [argent]  did  some  beautiful  things  in  Corfu.  Itis  a  wonderful  place  when  the  weather  is  all  right — and  even  whenit  is  not.  I  must  have  another  go  at  it  before  I  get  at  this  Plato  pic-ture ('The  Grove  of  Academe').  If  only  I  could  get  the  hang  of  theseolive  trees,  which  are  beautiful  but  exasperating  when  it  comes  tothe  leaves.

I  went  to  see  Eden's  panel  forthe  House  of  Lords,  which  is  extremely  interesting— and  I  thinkwill  be  satisfactory.  It  doesn't  seem  right  for  the  gentlemen  whohave  been  selling  their  pictures  for  hundreds  of  thousands  to  donothing  whatever  for  the  artists  of  their  own  day. .  .  They  are  prettywell  strangling  production.  I  believe     sold  a  picture  from  hiscollection  for  £80,000,  but  I  have  not  heard  of  his  spending  any  ofthis  to  help  produce  more  things .  My  p  eople  are  a  little  more  gener-ous than  this."  Mr.  Eden's  House  of  Lords  panel  represented  "TheExpansion  of  England."  The  others,  each  of  which  was  presentedby  a  peer  [at  £400  each] ,  and  which  were  all  in  progress,  represented'The  New  Learning,"  by  Mr.Cadogan  Cowper;  "The  RomanCatholic  Reaction,"  by  Mr.  Byam  Shaw;  "Henry  VIII. 's  Breakwith  Rome, "by  Mr. Frank  O.Salisbury;  "The  Reformation, "byMr. Ernest  Board;  and  "The  Origin  of  Parties,"  by  Mr.  Henry  A.Paine.Lord  Carlisle,  himself  an  amateur  painter,  and  the  donor  of  Mr.Cowper's  House  of  Lords  panel,  who  died  in  1910,  hadfor  a  numberof  years  been  seeing  a  great  deal  of  Abbey,  often  spending  hours  ata  time  in  his  studio.  They  corresponded  when  not  in  town,  andduring  the  progress  of  theHouse  of  Lords  panels  many  letters  passedbetween  them  which  would  have  been  of  value  to  this  biography,but  which  unfortunately  are  not  available,  although  Lord  Carlislepreserved  his  letters.Mr.  Cadogan  Cowper,  continuing  the  reminiscences  of  Abbeyfrom  which  quotations  were  made  in  an  earlier  chapter,  writes  ofthese  panels:  "I  did  not  actually  see  a  very  great  deal  of  him  afterI  left  Fairford  in  1903 — because  he  and  Mrs.  Abbey  always  livedfor  the  greater  part  of  the  year  in  the  country .  But  I  always  soughthis  advice  with  my  work  whenever  he  was  in  town  and  I  could  getit.  And  in  the  years  1909-1910  I  had  a  good  deal  of  correspond-VOL.II. — o  461HOUSE  OF  LORDS  PANELSence  with  him — and  then  I  saw  him  rather  more  often — about  theset  of  six  historical  mural  paintings  for  the  East  Corridor  of  theCentral  Hall  in  the  Houses  of  Parliament.  .  .  .  We  were  chosen  forthis  work  because  our  styles  of  painting  were  similar  to  some  extentand  likely  to  harmonise,  and  because  the  general  scheme  was  to  beGothic,  and  we  had  each  of  us  studied  Gothic  things.  Abbey  wasasked  to  superintend  the  whole  work  because  of  his  experience  as  amural  decorator  on  a  big  scale  and  because  of  his  great  knowledgeof  anything  Gothic,  and  to  ensure  that  there  should  be  completeuniformity  and  artistic  harmony  in  the  carrying  out  of  the  scheme....  It  was  the  greatest  advantage  to  us  to  have  his  advice  and  con-trolling hand .  Without  him  the  six  paintings  would  never  have  beenso  thoroughly  in  keeping  as  they  are."It  was  a  bitter  disappointment  to  us  that  the  Office  of  Workswould  not  allow  the  architectural  mouldings  and  ornamentations  ofthe  corridor  to  be  gilded  and  painted  to  complete  the  Gothic  schemeof  decoration  of  the  whole .  We  wanted  that  little  corridor  to  looklike  a  richly  gilded  and  painted  and  mediaeval  casket  or  shrine,  ofwhich  the  historical  wall  paintings  were  intended  to  be  part  of  thedecoration.  And  we  did  not  like  their  insisting  that  glass  must  befixed  over  our  paintings ,  thus  treating  them  as  if  they  were  easel  pic-tures, which  they  are  not  intended  to  be .  But  whenever  we  protestedthe  authorities  pointed  to  the  precedent  of  the  other  corridors  whichhave  paintings,  and  said  that  ours  must  be  like  that — in  spite  of  thefact  that  our  paintings  were  totally  different  in  style,  and  were  donewith  a  view  to  an  entirely  different  scheme  of  decoration .  Even  thebad  lettering  in  use  for  the  titles  of  the  pictures  in  the  other  corridorsthey  insisted  upon  repeating  in  our  corridor  under  our  paintings,  inspite  of  our  protests,  simply  for  the  sake  of  precedent  and  becausethis  bad  lettering  was  used  in  the  other  corridors."But  the  general  success  of  the  paintings  as  they  stand  is  due  tothe  untiring  trouble  which  Abbey  took  with  the  whole  matter.  Hehoped  it  would  be  the  beginning  oj  a  revival  of  in  terest  in  mural  pain  tingin  England,  which  always  does  such  an  immense  amount  of  good  tothe  art  of  a  country . ' '4 6 2TREVELYAN'S  "AMERICAN  REVOLUTION"In  December  came  a  very  characteristic  letter  from  Henry  Jamesconcerning  Sir  George  Trevelyan's  American  Revolution,  whichAbbey  had  been  reading  with  delight,  although  he  did  not  begin  ituntil  his  painting  of  "Valley  Forge"  and  all  the  details  therein  hadbeen  completed:  "  I  am  very  much  interested  in  your  interest  inTrevely an,  which  I  rejoice  to  have  put  you  more  urgently  on  read-ing .  I  did  so ,  from  volume  to  volume ,  with  real  emotion ,  and  he  heldme  breathless  and  intent  'right  along.'  He  is  very  flattering  to  us  (heis  judged  to  be  much  too  much  so  here)  and  is  not  the  success  withthis  public,  naturally ,  that  he  has  been  with  ours — though  one  feels,I  think,  all  sorts  of  deflections  and  misappreciations  in  him  (andall  favourable  to  us),  which  arise  from  his  having  done  the  wholething  with  no  personal  knowledge  of  the  country .  The  book  is  a  mostcurious  document  of  the  old  Whigs  and  C.  J.  Fox  tradition — whichplays  down,  through  the  long  years,  so  remarkably  straight  into  it,and  so  colours  and  animates  and  unifies  it  (in  feeling,  tone,  effect,etc.).  But  it  is  indeed  thrilling,  the  subject  of  the  first  order — andbeautifully,  admirably  done,  in  the  fine  old  'literary  history'  andslightly  unmodern  way.  What  it  mainly  suggests  to  us,  I  think,  is—  ist,  what  damned  disagreeable  and  thankless  people  we  were  towork  and  suffer  for;  2nd,  what  an  amazing  miracle  that  we  reallypulled  it  off  after  all ;  and  3rd,  what  a  regular  duck  of  a  dear  G.  W.was,  or  must  have  been,  and  quite  capable  of  having  been  charmingabout  the  cherry  tree.  If  only  modern  dentistry  had  been  inventedin  his  day  there  wouldn't  have  been  a  blot  upon  his  image.  But  tohave  gone  down  handsomely  to  the  ages  with  such  dentistry  showshow  much  else  there  was  of  him."One  more  letter  of  they  ear,  telling  Dr.  White  of  hard  work:  "Thereare, ' '  writes  Abbey ,"  no  holidays  in  my  trade .  It  is  always  in  the  backof  one's  head,  no  matter  what  one  is  doing.  I  am  losing  tie  after  tiewith  America .  Two  of  my  oldest  friends  died  recently — Gilder  andLaffan.  I  had  known  Gilder  since  '73 — and  had  seen  a  good  deal  ofhim  at  times — but  Laffan  was  one  of  my  most  intimate  and  dearestfriends,  and  makes  a  great  vacancy  in  my  life.  We  had  many  earlyschemes  in  common — some  came  off  and  some  didn't — but  he  was463DEATH  OF  McKIMalways  there — just  where  I  had  left  him  last.  McKim's  death  was  ahappy  release.  I  hadn't  seen  him  for  a  long  time — but  he  did  greatwork  for  his  time — his  steady,  quiet,  persistent  striving  for  all  thatwas  the  highest  and  best  in  his  profession — and  the  extraordinarynumber  and  ability  of  the  men  who  worked  under  him,  amazing.Of  course,  if  one  has  found  out  something — or  learned  somethingof  one 's  calling  in  life — it  is  a  great  pleasure  as  one  gets  older  to  handthe  results  of  one's  experience  onto  the  coming  chaps.  It  is  a  duty—but  a  good  many  men  ignore  that . ' '  These  three  men — Gilder,  aged65,  Laffan,  61 ,  and  McKim,  62 — all  died  within  two  months.  In  aletter  to  Mr.  Blashfield  a  day  or  so  before  that  quoted  above  Abbeysays :  "What  a  year  of  losses  it  has  been !  I  can't  think  of  Americawithout  thinking  of  the  empty  places."The  work  of  1910  was  almost  wholly  for  Harrisburg;  but  Abbeyturned  now  and  then  to  a  new  picture,  begun  on  a  smaller  canvasin  1906,  "The  Three  Marys,"  which,  however,  was  never  finished,and  at  times  painted  upon  his  design  for  "The  Grove  of  Academe,"and  made  a  number  of  studies.After  being  absent  from  the  Academy 's  walls  for  too  long,  he  mad  ea  reappearance  in  th  is  year  with ' '  Penn  's  Treaty  with  the  I ndians , ' 'and  the  great  snow  scene,  "The  Camp  of  the  American  Army  atValley  Forge,  February,  1778,"  both  painted  for  Harrisburg.  The"Valley  Forge"  painting,  to  which  in  the  catalogue  was  appendedthese  lines  from  Tennyson :Strong  Mother  of  a  Lion-line,Be  proud  of  those  strong  sons  of  thineWho  wrench 'd  their  rights  from  thee  !depicted  a  deeply  interesting  moment  in  the  history  of  America,whenBaronvonSteuben,oneof  Frederick  theGreat's  generals, anda  veteran  of  the  Seven  Years  War,  who  had  come  to  America  and  puthis  services  at  the  disposal  of  Washington  in  the  fight  for  liberty ,  un-dertook to  drill  raw  recruits  for  new  efforts.  Washington's  army,defeated  at  the  Brandywine  and  at  Germantown,  was  undergoinghardships  at  Valley  Forge,  during  a  terrible  winter  of  suffering,464THE  "VALLEY  FORGE"when  soldiers  tramped  barefoot  over  the  bleak  hill  and  yoked  them-selves to  rough  boxes  when  they  had  wood  or  stores  to  distributeamong  the  huts.  "The  training  of  small  squads  [wrote  one  of  thecritics  of  the  picture],  which  von  Steuben  conducted  musket  inhand,  was  the  beginning  of  a  thorough  system  of  reorganisation.The  awkward  squad  on  the  snowbound  Campus  Martius  containsthepromiseofthepotency  of  theAmerican  Commonwealth.  It  sumsup  the  agonising  winter  of  discontent  with  lucidity  and  comprehen-sion. Valley  Forge  stands  for  the  discipline  of  adversity,  for  suffer-ings endured  with  fortitude  and  uncomplaining  patience,  and  Mr.Abbey  has  nobly  expressed  the  spirit  of  the  famous  camp . ' 'The  late  Sir  Edward  Poy  nter  told  me  that  he  considered  the  "Val-ley Forge"  one  of  the  most  beautifully  painted  pictures  ever  hung  inthe  Academy  in  his  time;  while  at  theAcademy  banquet  of  1912, thefirst  after  Abbey 's  death,  he  said:  "I  have  little  hesitation  in  sayingthat  thatpicture, his  masterpiece  in  my  opinion, if  pathos, vivid  truthto  nature  and  masterly  execution  go  to  the  making  of  a  great  work,combined  in  an  unusual  degree  all  the  qualities  which  are  essentialto  the  production  of  a  truly  great  work  of  art . "Abbey  had  planned  to  paint  for  the  Senate  Chamber  "The  Battleof  Gettysburg,"  a  companion  to  the  "Valley  Forge,"  but  he  did  notlive  to  do  so.  Later  on  the  "Valley  Forge  "painting  was  removed —although  in  defiance  of  the  artist's  scheme —  from  the  wall  of  theSenate  Chamber,  to  which  it  had  been  fixed  and  for  which  it  wasplanned  and  executed,  to  a  position  in  theHouse  of  Representatives.It  is  to  be  hoped  that  no  injury  was  done  to  it.hibition, we  could  not  help  ..  .  paying  a  farewell  visit ."To-day,"TademawroteonAugust6th,"thelast  of  theR.A.

Sofaras  the  records  of  the  A.C.C.go,  this  was  his  last  match.465WINSLOW  HOMER'S  DEATHIn  spite  of  his  many  obligations  he  took  a  holiday  at  St.  Moritz  inAugust  and  was  noticeably  well ,  as  he  was  all  through  the  followingwinter  until  February.  While  at  St.  Moritz  he  met  his  old  painterfriend  Gedney  Bunce  (who  died  in  1917),  and  wrote  of  him:  "Hetold  me  he  was  seventy — but  he  has  looked  like  that  for  thirty  years . ' 'On  returning  home  in  August,  he  began  to  motor  regularly  eachweek  to  Woodcote  to  watch  progress,  the  removal  from  MorganHall  being  timed  for  early  in  the  following  year.Writing  to  Walter  James  in  October  he  says  of  Harrisburg:  ' '  Thebig  ceiling  is  approaching  completion  (unberufen!) .  I  Ve  used  seve-ral tons  of  costly  blue  paint  on  it — painted  it  all  in  the  mat  colours .  Ishould  think  you  could  use  these  well .  Their  great  pull  is  their  lumi-nosity, and  as  there  is  no  oil  in  them  to  get  yellow —  only  wax —  Idon't  see  why  they  should  not  stay  luminous"We  wentto  Letchworth  to  look  at  the  cottages — asweare  havingto  build  some.  In  the  course  of  a  number  of  years  Letchworth  maybean  attractive  spot —  at  present  not  so.  But  the  cottages  are  welldesigned  and  the  scheme  is  good.  I  drivel  on  and  say  nothing — so  Iwill  now  cease."A  letter  to  Mr.  Blashfield  on  October  28th  says  that  there  is  hopeof  finishing  the  ceiling  before  Christmas.  The  writer  continues:"They  keep  dropping  off — our  old  friends.  Since  I  was  inAmerica,dozens  of  them.  I  think  Homer  [Winslow]  a  great  loss.  I  began  toadmire  him  when  I  saw  his  things  in  Our  Young  Folks  and  Harper'sWeekly — ages  ago.  I  wonder  if  you  remember  a  drawing  in  Harper'sWeekly  of  a  Sharpshooter  in  a  pine  tree —  and  a  double  page  of  acamp-fire  with  a  soldier  dancing  a  break-down."It  is  now  time  to  make  a  survey  of  the  work  for  Harrisburg.  Al-though Abbey  did  not  live  to  complete  this  great  task,  and  althoughthe  paintings  which  he  did  complete  were  not  set  in  position  untilafter  his  death,  this  seems  to  be  the  best  place,  while  the  artist  wasin  the  midst  of  his  labours,  to  say  something  of  the  second  series  ofdecorations  for  the  Capitol  when  in  situ ,  and  for  this  description  pas-sages are  quoted  from  an  article  by  Mr.  Royal  Cortissoz  in  Scribner'sMagazinefor  January,  1912.  "There  is,"hesays,"astoryofVasari's4 6 6HARRISBURG  DECORATIONSwhich  is  apposite  here.  It  relates  to  Ghirlandajo,  Abbey's  Renais-sance prototype  in  decorative  narration.  The  old  Florentine  wasan  eager  business  man,  who  thought  that  no  job  was  too  small  to  beaccepted  inhisbottega.  But  as  he  got  more  and  more  authoritativelyinto  his  stride  the  artist  in  him  snuffed  the  finer  airs  of  battle  and  heflung  sordid  motives  and  obligations  upon  the  shoulders  of  his  bro-ther David.  "Leave  me  to  work  and  do  thou  provide,"  he  said,  "fornow  that  I  have  begun  to  get  into  the  spirit  and  comprehend  themethod  of  this  art  I  grudge  that  they  do  not  commission  me  to  paintthe  whole  circuit  of  all  the  walls  of  Florence  with  stories.'  Vasaritells  in  this  illustration  of  the  'resolved  and  invincible  character'  ofGhirlandajo 's  mind ,  and  as  showing  the  pleasure  he  took  in  his  work.That  was  like  Abbey.  He  was  in  love  with  his  work  and  his  themes,and  Harrisburg  was  his  Florence .  1 1  is  said  that  when  there  was  sometemporary  uncertainty  as  to  the  funds  available  for  part  of  his  deco-rative scheme  he  hastened  to  assure  the  authorities  that  it  wouldnevertheless  be  carried  out  by  him,  even  if  he  had  to  finish  some  ofthe  panels  without  any  remuneration  what  ever.  .  .  ."After  a  reference  to  the  eight  earlier  paintings  in  the  dome  Mr.Cortissoz  says:  "Through  these  designs  the  grand  elements  whichhave  formed  the  destiny  of  the  Commonwealth  are  broadly  em-bodied .  In  one  of  the  four  new  paintings  with  which  we  have  nowto  deal ,  human  history  gives  way  before  the  maj  estic  appeal  of  naturepure  and  simple;  but  in  the  other  three  Abbey  comes  to  close  gripwith  the  very  men  who  made  his  State ,  hailing  them  by  name ,  paint-ing their  portraits,  and,  in  a  word,  making  the  drift  of  his  whole  de-corative purpose  more  and  more  intimate  and  poignant."In  the  rotunda  it  was  his  role  to  touch  the  imagination  of  every-one entering  the  building  with  a  sense  of  what  Pennsylvania  hasowed  to  divine  inspiration  and  to  the  bounty  of  the  earth.  Theselarge  motives  belonged  on  the  threshold ,  and  in  the  Capitol 's  grand-est, most  aerial  chamber.  The  very  concrete,  personal  issues  dealtwithin  the  later  decorations  are  explained  by  their  positions.  Hehad  now  to  embellish  the  walls  of  the  House  of  Representatives ,  andthere  he  decided  to  confront  the  legislators  with  paintings  recalling467HARRISBURG  DECORATIONSthose  who  had  before  them  laboured  for  the  State.  Above  the  ros-trum of  the  Speaker  he  chose  to  place ' '  The  Apotheosis  of  Pennsyl-vania," which  is  really  a  painting  in  praise  of  famous  men,  a  recordof  high  endeavour.  For  the  unification  of  his  noble  company  of  ex-plorers, sea-captains,  soldiers,  religious  leaders,  and  other  con-structive pioneers,  he  had  to  devise  some  linear  web  that  would  notonly  hold  them  together  but  bind  them  in  the  harmony  of  a  roomwhose  scale  and  character  had  already  been  fixed.  It  was  a  difficultproblem  to  introduce  so  many  figures,  and  yet  not  make  them  intoa  crowd,  to  break  the  mass  into  small  groups  which  should  detachthemselves  without  landing  in  isolation ,  to  make  the  "  setting ' '  com-pose all  the  trouble  and  at  the  same  time  not  unduly  assert  itself.He  hit,  I  think,  upon  a  phenomenally  good  solution,  one  which  isthe  more  surprising,  too,  when  you  stop  to  consider  that  Abbeywas  never  a  disciple  of  such  old  masters,  say,  as  Veronese,  whohave  so  much  to  teach  us  on  questions  of  academic  balance  in  muraldecoration."Across  the  middle  of  his  canvas  and  well  back  of  his  figures  hedrew,  in  a  shallow  and  very  beautiful  curve,  the  lines  of  a  classicalentablature.  Above  them  he  unrolled  a  spacious  sky,  thus  gain-ing at  once  the  necessary  depth  and  largeness  of  atmosphere.  Wefeel  rather  than  see  the  colonnade  enclosing  the  actors  in  his  scene;it  unites  them,  but  it  does  not  distract  attention  from  them.  So  itis  with  the  'Genius  of  State,'  enthroned  beneath  a  cupola  againstthe  sky,  at  the  apex  of  the  composition.  This  presence  manifestsitself,  and  is,  in  fact,  indispensable,  but  it  is  so  placed  and  so  keptdown  in  the  colour  scheme  that  it  leaves  Abbey 's  men  to  stand  forthwith  no  diminution  of  individuality .  Neither  are  they  dimmed  norare  their  messages  muffled  by  the  return  to  architectural  motives  inthe  foreground,  by  the  fluted  pillars  which  mark,  as  it  were,  an  en-trance to  the  colonnade.  Like  the  latter,  these  pillars,  surmountedby  eagles,  enormously  contribute  to  the  orderliness  of  the  assem-blage while  they  leave  it  free."It  is  a  goodly  body  that  looks  down  upon  us  from  this  canvas.The  first  steps  below  the  throne  where  sits  the  Genius  of  State,4 6 8PENNSYLVANIA  WORTHIESsteps  on  which  laurel  wreaths  are  shrewdly  disposed,  are  occupiedby  the  worthies  who  take  us  back  to  the  earliest  pages  in  Pennsyl-vanian  history.  There  is  the  gallant  figure,  in  cloak  and  ruff,  of  SirWalter  Raleigh,  one  of  the  first  to  obtain  colonial  grants,  a  man  whoforesaw  the  tremendous  future  of  the  New  World.  Near  him  arenavigators  like  Hendrik  Hudson,  who  discovered  the  Delaware,and  old  Peter  Minuit,  who  on  a  memorable  occasion  sailed  into  theChesapeake.  To  the  right,  Abbey  remembers  not  alone  the  hardypath-breaker,  trusting  to  his  rifle,  but  the  valiant  pioneers  who  puttheir  faith  in  a  higher  aid,  Pastorius  Kelpius,  and  the  other  leadersof  those  various  religious  sects  which  have  contributed  some  of  themost  mystical  chapters  to  the  history  of  the  Church  in  America.Just  below  these  standing  pioneers,  marble  seats  are  occupied  bylater  servants  of  the  State.  John  Dickinson  is  there,  who  had  hisdoubts  about  the  'Declaration,'  but  approved  himself  a  sound  pat-riot when  the  time  came.  Judge  Thomas  MacKean  sits  in  gravecontemplation,  with  Provost  Smith,  of  the  University  of  Pennsyl-vania, and  White,  the  first  American  bishop,  for  his  neighbours.Place  is  found  for  old  Pastor  Muhlenberg,  who  knew  so  well  how  tostrive  for  the  right  not  only  in  but  out  of  the  pulpit;  and  we  see  alsoDallas,  the  statesman,  whoserved  as  Senator,  as  Vice-President, andas  Minister  to  Great  Britain,  and  John  Fitch,  with  the  model  of  hisengine.  Grouped  here,  at  the  right,  are  other  scientific  types:  OliverEvans,  with  hisroad  engine, David  Rittenhouse,the  astronomer  andphilosopher ,  Caspar  Wistar,  the  noted  surgeon ,  and  those  renownedbotanists,  the  Bartrams,  father  and  son.  Tom  Paine,  waking  suchdiversified  memories  of  oratory  and  of  hard  work  at  Valley  Forge,stands  meditatively  with  his  hand  raised  to  his  mouth.  On  this  sideof  the  composition  Stephen  Girard,  the  founder  of  the  college  fororphan  boys,  takes  one  of  these  under  his  protection.  Conspicu-ous among  the  balancing  figures  on  the  other  side  is  mad  AnthonyWayne,  drawing  his  sword.  Below  him,  carrying  on  the  militarythread,  are  soldiers  of  the  Civil  War,  officered  by  Hancock  andMeade,  and  cheered  on  by  Governor  Curtin  and  Thaddeus  Ste-vens. On  the  same  level  opposite  to  these  saviours  of  the  Union,469PENNSYLVANIA  WORTHIESwe  have  an  episode  calling  the  mind  back  to  the  arts  of  peace,  theworkers  in  the  mines  and  in  Pennsylvania's  outstanding  industriesof  steel  and  oil,  quietly  playing  their  parts."I  have  said  that  all  these  people  are  held  together  through  theartist's  faculty  for  composition.  The  homogeneity  of  the  piece  isassured  still  further  through  a  subtly  dramatic  touch,  which  sig-nifies not  only  good  academic  design ,  but  imaginative  power.  I  referto  the  grouping  in  the  foreground,  right  in  the  middle  of  the  paint-ing, of  the  three  supreme  Pennsylvanians,  William  Penn,  BenjaminFranklin ,  and  Rob  ert  Morris .  With  true  culminating  effect  and  withperfect  naturalness,  they  stand  upon  the  rock  upon  which  are  en-graved thewordsfrom  Deuteronomy,  'Remember  theDaysof  Old,Consider  the  Years  of  Many  Generations:  Ask  Thy  Father  and  HeWill  Show  Thee,  Thy  Elders,  and  They  Will  Tell  Thee.'  Surelythe  lawmakers  who  gaze  upon  this  fabric  of  the  painter's  art  mustrecognise  in  it  a  living  inspiration.  Far  beneath  that  shining  thronethey  may  see  at  work  the  humblest  men  in  the  State,  and  throughthe  airy  colonnade  they  can  catch  glimpses  of  the  ship  upon  itsstocks,  the  machines  of  the  steel  foundry ,  and  the  towering  derricksof  the  oil  field.  But  even  more  ufgent  is  the  appeal  of  those  men  ofgenius  and  devotion  whose  hearts  were  set  on  the  highest  ideals  ofcivilisation,  who  wrought  for  spiritual  as  well  as  worldly  things.  Itis  this  that  stamps  Abbey's  decoration  as  a  noble  work  of  art,  thefulness  and  the  sincerity  with  which  he  placed  all  his  faculties  as  adesigner  and  painter  at  the  service  of  an  idea.  If  there  is  any  moralforce  in  art,  then 'The  Apotheosis  of  Pennsylvania'  should  helpweightily  in  the  making  of  a  better  State.  ..."Passing  over  the  three  historical  paintings—  ' '  The  Reading  of  theDeclaration  of  Independence"  and  "Penn's  Treaty  with  the  In-dians, "which  flank  the  great"  Apotheosis,  "and  the"  Valley  Forge,"which  was  placed  in  the  Senate  Chamber,  Mr.  Cortissoz  reachesthe  allegorical  design  for  the  ceiling:  "In  this  he  gave  free  play  tothe  medievalism  which  was  part  of  his  artistic  character.  Chartingthe  heavens  after  the  fashion  of  some  old  cosmographer,  settingsun,  moon,  and  a  multitude  of  stars  in  a  sea  of  colour  running  from4 7 0"THE  HOURS"pale  tints  into  darkest  blue,  causing  the  Milky  Way  to  stream  lu-minously across  his  canvas,  and  even  thinking  to  bring  in  a  vagrantcomet,  he  unwound  the  procession  of  the  hours,  figuring  them  asmaidens  who  open  the  day  in  light  and  gladness  and  close  it  insolemn  draperies  carried  on  still  shoulders.  Half  the  ceiling  is  alljocund  beauty,  the  other  half  is  all  beautiful  gravity.  But  it  is,  per-haps, unfair  to  speak  of  the  "halves"  of  this  painting.  The  truthis  that  light  and  dark  are  subtly  fused.  Variegated  as  it  is  in  lightand  in  colour,  the  ceiling  is  nevertheless  all  of  a  piece,  a  poetic  ideaharmoniously  and  clearly  expressed.  In  this,  as  in  the  rest  of  hispaintings,  Abbey  is  sure  of  himself,  sure  of  what  he  wants  to  do;he  is  both  imaginative  and  workmanlike."  (Before  beginning,  forthe  ceiling,  the  final  canvas,  24  feet  in  diameter,  Abbey  had  painteda  finished  study  of  the  "Hours,"  12  feet  in  diameter,  which  is  nowin  the  possession  of  Mrs.  Abbey.)One  unavoidable  omission  from  Mr.  Cortissoz's  article  is  anyreference  to  the  colour  schemes  and  the  designs  for  all  the  archi-tectural ornament  in  the  House  of  Representatives  and  the  Sen-ate, which  also  were  the  artist's.  Nor,  naturally  enough,  for  Mr.Cortissoz  was  not  in  the  artist's  confidence,  is  there  any  referenceto  Abbey's  intention  to  paint  a  series  of  decorative  designs  forthe  Supreme  Court — symbolising  the  progress  of  the  Law,  begin-ning with  the  earliest  known  code,  that  of  Khammurabi,  about1 200  B.C.,  including  Moses  descending  Sinai  with  the  tables  ofstone,  and  continuing  to  modern  times.  Indeed  had  Abbey  livedto  do  all  the  work  upon  this  building  which  he  had  planned  to  do,and  hoped  to  do,  no  matter  what  it  cost  him  in  strength  and  time,it  would  be  one  of  the  most  remarkable  monuments  to  the  energyand  genius  of  one  man  that  exists.  As  it  is,  it  is  remarkable  enough.It  proves  that  the  race  of  giants  was  not  extinct.One  word  more  on  the  Harrisburg  decorations.  When,  after  Ab-bey's  death ,  the  "Apotheosis  of  Pennsylvania"  had  been  set  in  placein  the  House  of  Representatives,  on  the  wall  over  the  rostrum,  with"Penn's  Treaty"  on  the  same  wall,  to  the  left  of  it,  the  space  on  itsright,  intended  for  the  "Reading  of  the  Declaration  of  Indepen-THE  RITTENHOUSE  OBSERVATORYdence,"  was  empty.  The  oil  designfor  this  hadbeen  ready  for  severalyears,  but  the  Rittenhouse  Observatory,  evidently  a  temporary  con-struction, built  of  wood  for  the  observation  of  the  transit  of  Venus,had  wholly  disappeared,  and  Abbey,  in  his  desire  for  accuracy,  hop-ing to  discover  its  exact  locality ,  had  delayed  the  completion  of  thispainting,  but  in  spite  of  researches  made  in  libraries  and  in  everypossible  quarter  in  Philadelphia  and  elsewhere,  no  trace  of  its  posi-tion was  found  until  a  few  weeks  before  his  death,  when,  quite  nearthe  spot  indicated  in  his  design,  but  at  a  different  angle  to  the  StateHouse,  its  foundations  were  discovered.  During  those  last  days  hemade  a  small  new  design  and  squared  it  off,  intending  to  carry  outthis  alteration,  but  after  his  death,  when,  at  the  request  of  the  thenGovernor  of  Pennsylvania ,  Mrs .  Abbey — lest  a  strange  hand  shouldin  any  degree  destroy  the  harmony  of  that  wall — accepted  the  greatresponsibility  of  having  this  painting  executed  in  Abbey's  studio  atChelsea  Lodge,  the  position  of  the  Observatory  as  shown  in  Abbey 'soriginal  design  was,  by  the  advice  of  Mr.  Sargent,  adhered  to.  Forthe  reconstruction  of  the  Rittenhouse  Observatory,  at  the  sugges-tion of  the  late  Sir  David  Gill,  the  octagonal  observatory  built  byWren  in  1 675 ,  at  Greenwich ,  and  still  in  existence,  was  chosen  as  themodel.  Some  changes  were  made  in  the  balcony,  and,  in thepaint-ing,  the  building  is  represented  as  of  wood  instead  of  stone  or  brick.This  observatory  at  Greenwich  has  no  dome ,  domes  in  observatoriesnot  having  come  into  use  at  that  period.  It  was  built  with  high  win-dows opening  from  ceiling  to  floor,  that  the  instrument  might  bepassed  through  them,  as  seen  in  this  painting,  and  moved  fromwindow  to  window  as  required.Mrs.  Abbey  selected  from  Abbey's  great  collection  of  originalcostumes  (which  she  presented  later,  under  certain  conditions,  tothe  London  Museum)  all  the  garments  and  other  accessories  of  theperiod  which  were  to  be  used  for  this  painting,  and  Mr.  SeymourLucas,  R.A., confirmed  her  selection.  Mr. Ernest  Board,  Abbey'sformer  assistant,  executed  the  unfinished  work,  under  the  directionof  Mr.  Sargent,  who,  as  alabour  of  love,  superintended  thepainting,going  over  it  with  his  brush  wherever  he  saw  fit  to  do  so ,  and  Abbey 's4 7 2DECLARATION  OF  INDEPENDENCEfriend,  Lord  Northbourne,  posed  for  the  head  of  the  foregroundfigure  in  the  group  of  "Signers  "who  had  come  out  from  the  StateHouse  to  hear  Nixon  read  the  "Declaration"  from  the  balcony  ofthe  Rittenhouse  Observatory.CHAPTER  XLIILAST  DAYS1911    Aged  58-59The  Bookplate — Tadema  and  the  Birthdays —  Progress  at  Woodcote  Manor — TheBritish  School  in  Rome  and  the  "E.

Although  now  to  be  much  less  elaborate  thanoriginally  planned,  it  was  the  same  design  that,  every  year  for  thelast  twenty  years,  he  had  been  intending  to  carry  out,  introducingMrs.  Abbey 's  hand  with  a  finger  pointing  to  the  number  of  an  openvolume  held  in  place  on  a  roughly  constructed  book  stand,  whichhad  been  made  by  an  ingenious  model ,  and  which  Abbey  had  had  inconstant  use  all  these  years.  On  January  gth  he  asked  Mr.  EmeryWalker  to  make  a  photogravure  plate  from  it,  and  on  the  2Oth  Mr.Walker,  who  has  superintended  the  making  and  printing  of  thisbook,  sent  him  the  first  proof.  Abbey  finished  also  at  this  time  apen-and-ink  drawing, begun  in  1893, to  illustrate  the  song  "I  havea  House  and  Lands  in  Kent."  Meanwhile  his  house  and  lands  inHampshire  were  engaging  a  great  deal  of  attention,  and  he  was  busywith  the  architecture  of  the  period;  working  out  his  own  ideas  as  aline  for  the  architect,  his  cricketing  friend,  Mr.  (now  Sir)  ReginaldBlomfield,R.A.  Once  a  week  all  through  the  winter  and  early  springthe  Abbeys  motored  to  Bramdean,  about  seventy-five  miles  by  road—starting  sometimes  early  enough  to  see  the  sun  rise  on  the  way,occasionally  stopping  for  the  night  at  Winchester  or  Bramdean,usually,  with  three  hours  at  Woodcote,  returning  the  same  day,  ar-riving at  Morgan  Hall  after  dark.On  January  8th  a  letter  to  Walter  James  commiserates  with  himon  an  attack  of  measles.  "I'm  sorry  you  couldn't  have  come  downhere,  as  the  excitement  and  thrill  of  gazing  upon  my  magnificentefforts  would  probably  have  scared  the  measle  microbe  away.  Mi-crobes, I  am  told,  do  not  thrive  where  acute  cerebral  excitement  is474ALMA  TADEMApresent,  so  bear  this  in  mind  another  time.  .  .  There  is  nothingcheerful  to  tell  you.  A  man  left  his  cart  for  a  moment  outside  ourgate  what  time  he  entered  the  pub  over  the  way;  emerged  there-from having  kept  Christmas  for  a  few  minutes  inside;  tried  toclimb  up  on  the  cart;  cart  started;  man  fell  under  the  wheel;  cartloaded  with  turmuts  ran  over  his  arm  and  leg,  broke  both.  This  isthe  only  exciting  thing  that  has  occurred  here.  (Mrs.  Giles,  shesee  it)    "Tadema,  always  so  punctilious  to  send  birthday  greetings  to  hisfriends  and  liking  to  receive  them  himself,  acknowledges  Abbey'scongratulations  on  January  nth.  "Never,"  says  he,  "have  I  hadsuch  a  birthday  in  my  life,  and  that  happens  that  is  to  say  [Tademahad  never  completely  mastered  his  adopted  tongue]  the  birthdayhas  come  to  pass  now  seventy-five  times.  .  .  .Three-quarters  of  acentury  have  passed  since  I  howled  for  the  first  time,  and  I  still  con-tinue to  hope  to  continue  a  little  while  longer."  It  was  destined  thatTadema  should  outlive  his  younger  friend,  but  only  by  a  year."The  Apotheosis,"  "The  Hours,"  "The  Grove  of  Academe,""The  Reading  of  the  Declaration  of  Independence,"  were  now  Ab-bey 's  daily  tasks  and  kept  him  busy.  A  letter  to  Dr.  White  on  March2oth  mentions  Harrisburg  progress.  "  I  Ve  been  pounding  away  onthat  big  35  footer  all  winter  without  cessation,  and  it  is  nearly  done(unberufen!).  I  am  hoping  to  get  the  loan  of  one  of  the  large  halls  inthe  White  City ,  for  a  pecuniary  consideration,  of  course.  They  havesome  very  high  ones  that  they  may  not  use  for  their  exhibition  thisyear.  I  am  greatly  hoping  that  you  may  be  able  to  get  for  me  thosesketches  from  Huston —  I  can't  imagine  what  he  wants  with  them,and  they  are,  although  slight,  invaluable  to  me,  as  the  first  notes  onemakes  always  are:  the  ones  I  sent  him  in  1905  as  tentative  sketches,and  which  he  afterwards  returned  to  me,  and  then  cables  asking  meto  send  them  back  to  him.  Also  the  sketches  I  sent  with  the  colourschemes:  there  were  a  number  of  these  among  them —  one  for  the'Battle  of  Gettysburg' — another  a  processional  frieze  with  a  gildedbackground,  etc.,  etc.  It  would  be  the  greatest  help  to  me  if  youcould  get  them.475PROGRESS  AT  WOODCOTE"Our  goings  on  at  Woodcote  progress  with  that  deliberation  thatcharacterises  the  B.  workman,  especially  him  of  the  S.  of  England..  .  .  You  will  arrange  to  visit  us  there  as  soon  as  we  are  settled.  Youwill,  I  devoutly  hope,  find  the  arrangements  for  washing  yourselfample  and  satisfactory.

I  am  wondering  if  you  will  also  take  to  advanceddairy  farming.  We  went  to  see  a  friend,  not  far  from  Woodcote,  theother  day,  who  had  a  wonder  of  a  dairy.  Cows  made  to  walk  acrossa  drained  asphalt  pavement  before  they  entered  the  sacred  milkingroom ,  where  running  streams  were  laid  on  in  all  directions .  Therewere  sterilising  chambers  and  most  ingenious  traps  for  microbes  ofall  kinds — triglyphs  and  monoliths  and  things.  You  never  saw  sucha  place.  The  cows  in  the  meadow  were  all  lying  down.  I  dare  saythey  get  pretty  tired.  We  are  coming  to  the  conclusion  that  our  Pre-sident [Mr.Taft]  is  a  pretty  civilised  sort  of  a  man,  and  if  he  pullsoff  this  business  of  arbitration,  as  I  suppose  he  will,  if  the  Irish  andGermans  will  let  him,  he  will  have  ma.de  a  big  name  for  himselfOur  car  has  been  a  godsend  this  last  six  months .

We  go  to  town  this  week  for  a  night.  I've  anR.A.  meeting  and  am  to  interview  the  White  City  people  again,"and  three  times  during  that  March  the  Abbeys  motored  to  ChelseaLodge  to  dine  with  various  friends,  returning  to  Fairford  the  fol-lowing day.On  March  2ist  Abbey  writes  to  the  late  Frederick  Mead,  his  bro-ther-in-law: "Will  you  add  to  the  obligations  I  am  under  to  you,one  more,  and  that  is,  I  want  a  drum  of  1861 .  There  is  a  place  inBroadway  somewhere  near  Canal  Street — /  think — where  they  sellmilitary  goods  and  all  sorts  of  curiosities.  It  is  a  sort  of  museum  aswell.  I  can't  remember  the  name  of  it.  They  supply  S.AmericanRevolutions  with  war  material,  etc.,  among  other  things.4 7 6"THE  YOUNGER  FRY""  I  Ve  mislaid  the  catalogue .  The  drum  I  want  is  a  wooden  drum—a  regimental  drum.  As  I  remember  them,  they  were  larger  thanthose  used  since — and  painted  blue,  with  the  State  arms  on  the  front— perhaps — although  this  is  not  essential.  Will  you  please  buy  meone,  with  the  proper  straps,  and  send  it  to  me  by  the  AmericanLine  ?"  This  drum ,  which  duly  arrived ,  is  to  b  e  seen  in  the  left-handcorner  of  the  "Apotheosis . ' 'Letters  of  advice  and  encouragement  were  written  through  thewinter  to  his  young  artists,  whom  Abbey  kept  ever  in  mind,  amongthem  to  Mr.  Board,  on  March  27th,  referring  to  his  House  of  Lordspanel:  "Poynter  spoke  to  me  the  other  night  in  the  warmest  termsof  your  H.  of  L.  panel,  which  he  thought  'a  most  beautiful  pieceof  work'."  And,  in  a  previous  letter,  writing  of  Mr.  Board's  "Ma-donna of  the  Fishermen , ' '  which  he  was  to  work  upon  in  the  ChelseaLodge  studio  :  "The  other  day  it  seemed  to  me  it  could  be  cheeredup  a  little  if  you  were  to  paint — as  it  were,  rudely — the  coat-of-armsof  the  town  on  the  sail  of  the  boat.  I  enclose  the  data.  It  would  beinteresting,  I  think.  If  you  do  it,  it  should  be  done  aery  lightly.  Justa  suggestion."  And  again:  "You  will  have  time  to  do  all  you  want..  .  .  You  will  find  materials  for  art  painting  on  the  premises."An  idea  of  Abbey's  attitude  towards  these  younger  men  may  begained  from  the  following  letter  of  April  2nd,  191 1 ,  to  Mr.  HarrisonMorris,  but  neither  finished  nor  sent.  In  it  he  refers  to  his  super-vision of  the  House  of  Lords  panels — which  was  a  labour  of  love:"About  the  most  interesting  thing  there  is  when  one  is  'getting  on'a  bit  is  watching  the  development  of  the  younger  fry.  I  have  beenseeing  a  group  of  young  fellows — six — through  a  series  of  decora-tive panels  for  the  House  of  Lords  recently,  to  the  extent,  that  is,  ofsettling  the  horizon  line,  the  scale  of  the  figures,  etc.  Six  lords  con-tributed a  panel  each,  and  seemed  to  think  I  ought  to  see  themthrough,  which  it  was  a  pleasure  to  do,  as  one  or  two  of  the  panelswere  by  comparatively  unknown  men.  Of  course  the  merits  of  thepanels  vary,  and  the  men  will  not  be  allowed  by  the  Office  of  Worksto  paint  the  architecture,  which  being  Gothic  and  of  stone  should,of  course, bepainted."  What  Abbey  did  not  say  was  thatthepaintersVOL.  ii. — P  477THE  ROME  EXHIBITIONof  the  panels  were  for  the  most  part  members  of  what  might  becalled  his  School.  Sir  Luke  Fildes,  in  talking  to  me  recently  abouthis  old  friend,  expressed  regret  that  Abbey's  death  had  meant  thewithdrawal  of  so  much  of  the  inspiration  and  stimulus  that  he  wasbeginning  to  exert.What  Abbey  also  did  not  say  was  that  he  had  been  approached  asto  taking  part  in  the  scheme  while  it  was  still  inceptive,  but  it  wasnot  possible  for  him  to  do  so.  Over  two  years  later,  in  1910  (LordCarlisle,  who  died  soon  after,  being  the  intermediary),  he  was  askedto  paint  the  work  to  which  he  refers  in  this  letter  to  Mr.  Morris  :"They  wanted  me  to  do  a  large  panel  of  the  Lying  in  State  of  KingEdward  VII .  for  St.  Stephen's  Hall  in  the  H .  of  P.,  but  Harrisburgblocks  that .  I  can 't  do  more  than  I  can  do ."I  have  been  reading,"  the  letter  continues,  "with  interest  yourremarks  in  the  current  Scribner  about  the  Rome  Exhibition.  I  amglad  our  chaps  at  home  are  going  to  have  so  brave  a  show,  and  Icannot  help  regretting  that  I  received  no  invitation  to  contribute,from  America.  Our  men  will  more  than  hold  their  own  in  any  show—and  do,  as  it  is—  — ."  Abbey  was  not  invited  directly,  becausehe  was  to  be  represented  in  the  American  section  by  two  importantworks,  sent  direct  from  New  York,  one  of  them ' '  The  Trial  of  QueenKatharine,"  lent  by  Senator  Clark.  He  was  represented  also  in  theBritish  section,  for  the  Committee  in  Rome  did  not  object  to  hisexhibiting  in  both  sections.  The  letter  continues:  "The  BritishCommittee  asked  me  whether  they  might  borrow  my  picture  ofRichard  III .  from  the  owner  here  for  the  Show  in  Rome,  as  he  waslending  a  good  many  pictures  and  would  lend  mine  with  the  rest.  Icouldn't  refuse  and  it  is  there.  They  said  their  things  must  be  kepttogether.  I  had  no  idea  until  I  read  your  article  that  American  artistswere  having  a  show.  I  should  have  been  glad  to  send  something,although  I  pay  very  little  attention  to  exhibitions,  as  I  paint  so  fewpictures.  ...  I  have  never  thought  it  made  much  difference,  if  thepicture  is  a  good  picture,  what  the  nationality  of  the  man  is  whopainted  it.  On  the  other  hand,  if  an  American  paints  a  bad  picture,I  find  that  I'm  sorry."4 7 8FIFTY-NINTH  BIRTHDAYTo  Alma  Tadema's  congratulations  on  his  birthday  (April  ist)Abbey  replied:  "Why  it  is  that  at  this  time  of  life,  instead  of  when  Iwas  younger  and  slimmer  and  friskier,  I  am  fated  to  do  work  in-volving activity  and  agility  not  only  of  mind  but  of  body,  I  don'tknow,  but  thus  it  is.  I  often  think  of  you  sitting  comfortably  down,in  a  beautifully  neat  studio,  quietly  doing  beautiful  things,  and  wisha  little  more  of  that  kind  of  thing  had  drifted  my  way.  I  suppose  Ioutgrew,  or  wore  out,  my  audience  for  one  kind  of  thing  and  had  toget  a  bran  new  one  for  this  other  kind.  Still  I  pound  away,  and  havea  long  road  ahead  of  me ,  if  my  health  and  strength  hold  out .  I  greatlywish  that  you  could  see  my  work,  and  when  it  goes  up  to  town  I  hopeyou  will,  for  I  have  a  prospect  of  getting  a  high  place  to  work  in  for  alittle  while.  You  would  be  surprised,  if  you  were  to  try  to  find  one,how  few  places  there  are  3  5  feet  high .  That  is  1 1  feet  higher  than  myyellow  tree  of  last  year.  I've  been  obliged  to  cut  it  in  slices  to  workon  here.  I  can  get  two  at  a  time  together,  but  not  three."  Abbeysaw  the  three  slices  together — the  whole  3  5  feet  square — for  the  firsttime  only  after  the  canvases  had  been  set  up  at  the  White  City.This  year— although  destined  to  be  the  last  in  Abbey 's  life — foundhim  with  his  interest  in  all  that  his  own  hand  was  doing  at  its  quickest.It  is  almost  as  though,  subconsciously,  knowing  how  short  a  timewas  still  his,  he  was  feverishly  endeavouring  to  miss  no  moment.Nor  were  his  own  affairs  his  sole  concern.  Never  was  he  more  en-gaged by  the  activities  of  others.  A  few  days  later — busy  as  he  waswith  so  many  projects — he  found  time  to  answer  a  long  letter  fromMr.  Blashfield  about  certain  aspects  of  mural  work  in  America  inwhich  it  was  hoped  that  Abbey  would  take  an  interest.  The  date  isApril  6th ,  and  Abbey  promised  to  do  what  he  could ' '  at  long  range . ' 'And  then  on  April  icthwe  find  a  long  and  important  letter  to  Mr.Frank  Dicksee,R.A.,  outlining  a  project  which  had  been  near  Ab-bey's heart  for  a  long  while:  "Once  more  I  write  to  you  as  one  who.  .  It  may  have  reached  your  ears  that  the  trus-tees of  the  Exhibition  of  1 85 1  have  had  an  idea  of  giving  art  scholar-ships, or  travelling  studentships  of  a  substantial  value,  at  any  rate£200 — and  I  hope  £300 —  if  they  can  be  shown  that  there  is  sub-thinks  about  things.  .479THE  AMERICAN  ACADEMYstantial  machinery  for  the  awarding  of  these  scholarships,  and  thatthere  will  b  e  some  string  to  them  in  order  that  they  may  feel  that  therecipients  are  not  wasting  their  time  and  all  their  money.  This  ideawas,  I  believe,  suggested  by  Lord  Esher,  at  the  last  R.A.  dinner,  toBrock,  and  he  talked  it  over  with  Webb  and  me.  .  .  .  We  thought  itmight  be  the  nucleus  of  an  Academy  in  Rome,  on  the  lines  of  theFrench  and  American  Academies,  and  we  still  think  so.  ...  TheR.I.B.A.  have  been  discussing  the  feasibility  of  this  plan  (not  the1851  plan  but  the  Roman  plan) —  for  a  year  or  two —  and  last  yearsent  [Mr.F.M.]  Simpson —  an  excellent  and  energetic  chap —  toRome  to  inquire  into  things ,  cost ,  etc . ,  and  he  brought  back  a  ratherformidable  array  of  figures— I  think  too  formidable — you  can't  geta  Villa  Medici  at  one  jump  in  these  days,  even  if  you  could  get  one  atall ,  but  they  are  going  on,  and  plans  are  well  on  the  way  to  bear  fruit,up  to  a  point.  The  American  Academy  was  pushed  through  by  theextraordinary  energy ,  ability ,  and  enthusiasm  of  one  man — McKim—who  called  a  meeting  at  the  University  Club  in  N .  Y . ,  about  twelveyears  ago,  of  Architects,  Sculptors,  Painters  and  Engineers — I  thinkthere  were  about  twenty  altogether,  but  I  forget.  They  came  fromall  over  the  U .  S .,  and  they  founded  the  Academy .  I  am  glad  to  thinkthat  I  was  one  of  them."The  idea,  the  raison  d'etre,  of  the  Academy  is  to  bring  togetherthe  three  arts  of  Painting,  Sculpture,  and  Architecture,  with  theideaof  teaching  sculptors  and  painters  the  requirements  and  rules  ofarchitects,  and  to  encourage  the  development  of  the  three  arts  inharmony — or  co-operation,  or  whatever  you  choose  to  call  it.  TheAmerican  Academy  has  been  a  splendid  success  so  far.  There  arearchitectural  scholarships  from  Harvard,  Pennsylvania,  Chicago,and  Columbia  Universities,  and  painting  and  sculpture  scholar-ships from  other  schools .  They  live  in  the '  Villa  Miraflore , '  which  isthe  property  of  the  Academy,  at  a  nominal  cost,  deducted  from  thescholarship  fund,  and  they  have  studios  found  them  as  well,  free."Now  it  is  absolutely  essential  that  there  be  a  'hostel.'  We  havehad,  at  the  R.A.,  experienceof  chaps  gettingthe  Travelling  Scholar-ship,and  glob  e  trotting  with  it — with  no  esp  ecial  profit  to  themselves4 8 0THE  BRITISH  SCHOOL  IN  ROMEor  anybody  else.  To  make  a  long  story  short,  I  went  up  the  day  be-fore yesterday  to  a  meeting  of  the  1851  people —  Lord  Esher,  SirArthur  Rucker,Ogilvy,  of  the  Board  of  Education,and  another  man,Brock  and  Webb —  and  we  gave  our  views;  and  the  upshot  of  it  wasthat  they  are  prepared  to  give  these  sums ,  if  we  are  able  to  show  themhow  to  do  it."Webb's  society  is  all  prepared —  and  Brock's  sculptors  jointlywill  look  after  their  end — but  the  painters!  I,  of  course,  was  abso-lutely unable  to  say  what  we  would  do —  but  I  said  I'd  find  out  andcommunicate.  When  Esher  asked  'Why  Rome?'  the  reason  given  isthat  which  McKim  gave — Rome  is  within  reach  of  everywhere .  It  isthe  centre  of  the  schools  in  Italy.  It  comprises  everything — Classic,Renaissance,  and  the  whole  gamut.  The  other  schools  are  there,and  the  atmosphere  is  there.  The  Vatican  is  a  practically  endlessand  inexhaustible  mine —  and  soon — one  has  to  stop  there  a  veryfew  weeks  to  see  '  Why  Rome  ? '"Now  the  pessimistic  wail  of  poor  old  -  -  the  wail  of  the  oldman  who  has  done  with  putting  his  shoulder  to  the  wheel,  and  pre-fers to  give  up  rather  than  to  face  the  music ,  buck  up  and  go  ahead—is  echoed,  naturally,  by  other  old  men  whose  vitality  is  running  low.I  say  this  without  the  slightest  disrespect  to  them,  but  they  have  nobusiness  to  try  to  clog  the  wheels  and  by  their  continued  participa-tion in  the  affairs  of  the  Academy  prevent  younger  and  consequentlymore  alive  men  from  doing  the  work  that  is  to  be  done —  and  mustbe  done.  It  is  of  no  use  to  sit  down  and  moan  over  things  if  you  areunable  to  better  them.  The  decent  and  proper  thing  is  to  hand  overthe  job  to  those  who  are  capable  of  carrying  it  on.  I  have  oftenthought  that  the  reason  we  get  so  little  from  our  gold-medal  men  is,in  the  first  place,  the  fact  that  they  have  nowhere  to  go  when  they  goabroad,  and  that  they  have  no  guiding  hand  to  steer  them,  no  back-ground of  any  kind,  and,  as  a  rule,  are  innocent  of  any  knowledge  ofa  foreign  tongue  or  the  value  of  foreign  money.  The  Americans,  bythe  way,  are  obliged  to  pass  an  exam  in  Italian."If  we  could  consolidate  our  prize  or  'gold  medal'  with  theseothers,  don't  you  think  it  would  be  a  good  thing?  The  value,  £200,4 8 1A  HOSTEL  INDISPENSABLEis  not  what  it  was  thirty,  or  even  ten,  years  ago.  It  should  be  annualand  it  should  be  awarded  for  two  years  at  least.  Men  with  their  wayto  make  don't  care  to  stop  away  much  longer  than  that.  In  France,of  course,  they  are  well  looked  after.  I  am  sendingyou — pleasereturnit — the  Annuaire  of  the  'Institut.'  You  will  see  under  the  head  ofthe  prizes  of  the  Academic  des  Beaux  Arts,  how  well  their  AlmaMater  looks  after  them .  They  can  get  a  lot  of  extra  money  in  prizesif  they  are  good  enough .  That  is  one  of  the  things  one  admires  in  theFrench.  They  are  always  thinking  of  the  patrie  when  they  are  notthinking  ofthefamille,  and  no  matter  how  small  the  sum  they  have  attheir  disposal  may  be ,  they  try  to  leave  it  for  some  good  obj  ect .  We  doit,  too,  but  we  don't  do  it  so  much,  nor  so  carefully.  When  I  go  up  totown ,  which  will  b  e  in  about  ten  days ,  we  will  have  a  little  meeting  [adinner  at  Chelsea  Lodge] ,  and  see  what  can  be  done.  It  is  a  splendidchance  and  we  should  not  allow  it  to  slip  ..  .  We  can  talk  it  over;  butdon't  let  us  occupy  our  time  moaning  over  the  difficulties."A  letter  from  Abbey  to  the  late  Sir  E.J.Poynter,P.R.A.,  developsthe  scheme  again,  and  indicates  how  near  to  his  heart  it  was  duringthe  last  months  of  his  life .  The  date  is  May  yth  ,1911."  Throughout ,we  have  argued  for  a '  hostel . '  It  has  seemed  to  us  that  it  is  a  primalnecessity  that  the  students  should  have  a  home  to  go  to,  instead  ofwasting  time  and  energy  in  a  strange  country,  with  strange  moneyand  foreign  customs,  learning  how  to  live.  A  studio  with  rooms  andso  forth  we  have  thought  should  be  provided;  and  the  raison  d'etreof  the  American  school  is  that  it  brings  together  in  a  communitystudents  in  the  three  branches.  Our  idea  there  is  that  paintingshould  be  divorced  as  much  as  possible  from  picture  frames  as  itsultimate  goal  and  that  the  painter  student  and  also  the  sculptor  stu-dent should  learn  the  limitations  and  requirements  of  painting  andsculpture  as  applied  to  the  decoration  of  buildings  and  monuments,and  that  they  should  recognise  the  fact  that  the  three  Arts  are  inter-dependent. This  is  all  trite  to  you,  but  it  is  not,  curiously  enough,to  a  good  many .  However,  the  latter  is  a  point  that  would  be  debated ,and  perhaps  lead  to  irrelevant  discussion.  So  it  might  be  wiser  totouch  upon  it  lightly, for  the  moment!THE  BRITISH  SCHOOL  IN  ROME' '  I  have  thought  that  some  form  of  preliminary  competition  mightbe  held,  say,  in  Edinburgh,  or  Glasgow,  Sheffield,  Liverpool,  Bir-mingham, etc.,  etc.,  as  well  as  in  London,  and  that  the  best  menshould  be  selected  from  these  centres  to  send  work  for  the  com-petition to  us — say  in  October  or  November."If  we  could  provide  cubicles  for  the  competitors  to  do  this  fi-nal work  in,  as  in  Paris,  so  much  the  better,  but  I  fear  that  it  istoo  much  to  hope  for;  but  it  would  be  a  very  popular  move  to  offerthe  use  of  our  galleries  and  the  services  of  our  members  (not  theCouncil),  the  school  committee,  perhaps,  or  the  figure  painters.I  think  it  is  an  opportunity  to  do  a  fine  thing  that  we  should  notmiss.  There  is  no  doubt  we  are  a  little  unpopular,  or,  what  is  worse,unfashionable,  and  this  would  show  that  we  are  still  alive.  Perhaps,eventually,  we  might  merge  our  own  travelling  studentship  in  thisand  so  save  some  money,  if  that  is  a  good  thing  to  do.  Personally  Ishould  think  it  wiser  to  try  to  wake  up  the  Exhibition  a  little,  ratherthan  to  groan  over  losses."I  fear  this  is  a  long  and  boring  screed."And  please,  if  you  think  it  would  be  better  policy  to  ask  someother  member  of  the  R  .A .  to  accompany  you  onThursday ,  I  sincerelyhope  you  will  not  consider  me,  as  I  have  not  the  slightest  wish  to  putmyself  forward  in  the  matter;  but  if  you  think  I  would  be  of  use,  Ishould  be  most  happy  to  go  with  you  and  appreciate  the  compli-ment. I  think  the  American  rules  very  good.  They  have  workedwell  and  were  carefully  thought  out .  McKim  's  ambition  was  to  geti  ,000,000  dols.  for  an  endowment  fund.  He  got  800,000  dols.,  buthis  death  was  a  serious  blow."The  British  School  in  Rome,  originally  founded  in  1901  for  thepromotion  of  Roman  studies,  was  reconstituted  in  191 1  under  theaegis  of  the  Royal  Commissioners  for  the  Exhibition  of  1851 ,  andunder  the  new  scheme,  in  addition  to  Faculties  of  Archaeology ,  His-tory and  Letters,  Faculties  of  Painting,  Sculpture  and  Architecturewere  also  instituted,  in  order  that  advanced  and  promising  stu-dents of  these  arts  might  enjoy  facilities  for  further  study  similarto  those  offered  by  the  French  and  American  Academies  in  Rome.483THE  BRITISH  SCHOOL  IN  ROMEAlthough  four  members  were  to  be  appointed  by  the  Royal  Aca-demy it  will  b  e  seen  in  the  passage  quoted  below  from  notes  suppliedby  Mr.  Evelyn  Shaw,  the  Honorary  Secretary  of  the  Royal  Com-missioners for  the  Exhibition  of  1 85 1 ,  that  Abbey  was  appointed  amember  of  the  first  Council,  not  by  the  Academy  but  by  the  Com-missioners, and  that  even  as,  in  the  country  of  his  birth,  he  was  oneof  the  original  incorporators  of  the  American  Academy  in  Rome,  soin  England,  he  was  in  the  forefront  of  the  movement  to  establishthe  British  School,  although  the  Royal  Charter  of  Incorporationwas  granted  to  the  School  only  after  his  death."Abbey's  connection  with  the  scheme  [writes  Mr.  Shaw]  datesback  to  1 9 1  o ,  when  he  was  approached  by  the  Royal  Commissionersfor  the  Exhibition  of  1 85 1  for  advice  as  to  the  establishment  of  whatare  now  the  Rome  Scholarships  in  Architecture ,  Sculpture ,  and  D  e-corative  Painting.  His  keen  interest  in  the  Commissioners'  plans  atonce  made  itself  felt,  and  when  the  British  School  in  Rome  was  re-constituted he  became  an  original  member  of  the  Faculty  of  Paint-ing and  was  also  the  first  representative  of  the  Royal  Commissionersof  1851  on  the  Council,  being  succeeded  as  a  member  of  the  latterbody  by  Mr.  Sargent."The  first  step  in  the  reconstruction  of  the  British  School  was  theerection,  from  designs  by  Sir  Edwin  Lutyens,  of  a  new  building  inthe  Valle  Giulia,  on  land  presented  for  the  purpose  by  the  munici-pality of  Rome,  and  situated  within  a  short  distance  of  thePorta  delPopolo.  Abbey's  name  and  fame  are  kept  in  memory  at  the  BritishSchool  by  the  "E.  A.  Abbey  Hostel,"  presented  by  Mrs.  Abbey  as  amemorial  to  her  husband.  The  Hostel  provides  a  certain  numberof  studios  with  bedrooms,  to  which  the  decorative  painters  have  thefirst  claim.  Mrs.  Abbey's  letter  to  Lord  Esher  (as  Chairman  of  theBoard  of  Management  of  the  Royal  Commissioners  for  the  Exhibi-tion of  185 1)  in  191 3 ,  offering  this  endowment,  mentioned  that  theHostel  was  to  be  a  token  of  her  husband's  and  her  own  recognitionof  the  hospitality  which  Abbey  had  received  during  the  thirty- threeyears  that  he  had  lived  in  England,  and  especially  from  the  membersof  his  own  profession, "who  not  only  accepted  him  as  one  of  them-484THE  "E.  A.  ABBEY  HOSTEL"selves,  but  elected  him  to  membership  of  their  various  bodies."  Itwas  Abbey's  intention,  this  letter  continued,  one  day  to  paint  andto  present  to  the  English  nation  a  decoration  for  a  public  buildingin  London.  This  no  longer  being  possible,  the  Hostel  was  offeredto  the  British  School  in  Rome  in  the  hope  that  it  might  in  some  wayso  aid  the  activities  of  that  institution,  in  which  he  took  so  vital  aninterest,  that  it  might  one  day  send  forth  an  artist  who  should  carryon  his  work  and  traditions.  Facing  the  main  entrance  to  the  school,in  a  niche  of  the  Hostel,  is  a  bust  by  Sir  Thomas  Brock  of  the  artistwhom  it  commemorates ,  exhibited  in  the  Academy  of  1 9 1 7 .To  return  to  the  narrative — on  April  loth,  the  same  date  as  theletter  to  Mr.  Dicksee,  Abbey  tells  Dr.  White,  in  the  last  letter  he  wasto  write  him:  "Kiralfy  has  been  persuaded  by  Lord  Blyth  to  let  mehave  the  use  of  one  end  of  the  big  Machinery  Hall  at  the  White  City ,Shepherd's  Bush.  Itis  about4ofeet  high, andl  cangetmybig  thing['The  Apotheosis  of  Pennsylvania']  up  all  together  there  and  polishit  off — I  trust(unberufen!)  in  no  time —  "  and  thither  went  the  bigcanvases,  the"  Apotheosis,  "the  "Hours"  (the  ceiling),  and  "Penn'sTreaty  with  the  Indians,"  and  to  Chelsea  Lodge  went  the  canvasesfor  Plato's  "Grove  of  Academe." — That  is  the  last  letter  that  hascome  to  light  in  Abbey 's  own  hand,  although  several  very  importantones  about  matters  concerning  the  British  School  in  Rome  and  Aca-demy affairs  were  written  in  the  next  weeks.By  request  Abbey  sent  to  the  exhibition  at  the  White  City — the"Coronation" Exhibition — his  "May-Day  Morning"  and  "Crusa-ders sighting  Jerusalem/'  He  went  up  to  Chelsea  Lodge  later  thisspring  than  was  his  wont — not  until  April24th— partly  that  he  mightpush  on  the  Harrisburg  work  and  the  design  for  the  "Grove  ofAcademe"asfar  as  possible  before  setting  them  up  in  London,  andpartly  because — as  he  was  not  to  return  to  Morgan  Hall  again,  exceptto  make  the  move  to  Hampshire — he  wished  to  select  from  a  mass  ofaccumulated  studies  a  large  number  (the  maj  ority  of  them  compara-tively small)  which  had  been  made  for  the  "Holy  Grail"  frieze,  forthe  Harrisburg  work,  for  the  Coronation  picture,  for  the  Paris  rere-dos  and  other  paintings,  as  well  as  many  designs  for  pictures  not  yet485A  BUSY  SPRINGexecuted,  with  the  purpose  of  completing  them  and  having  an  exhi-bition and  sale  of  these  in  London  and  in  America.  Indeed,  he  hadnever  seemed  more  full  of  enterprise  than  when  he  motored  up  totown  in  the  spring  of  191 1 ;  had  never  seemed  more  vigorous  men-tally, more  interested,  both  in  his  own  work  and  in  many  mattersoutside  his  own  work,  for  he  not  only  attended  all  the  meetings  ofthe  Royal  Commissioners  for  the  Exhibition  of  1 85 1 ,  in  connectionwith  the  British  School  in  Rome,  but  he  was  full  of  new  projects  forthe  conduct  of  the  Royal  Academy,  its  schools  and  its  exhibitions.He  went  every  day  to  the  White  City  to  do  the  little  that  was  neededto  finish  the  work  there,  and  ordered — that  it  might  be  set  up  in  theChelsea  Lodge  studio —  the  big  canvas,  50  feet  by  13  feet,  for  the"Grove  of  Academe,"  intending  to  place  upon  it  at  once  the  designhe  had  prepared.  But  this  was  not  to  be,  and  the  canvas  was  neverset  up.  He  attended  the  Private  View  at  the  Academy  and  the  Aca-demy banquet  and  the  "Greenwich"  dinner;  was  present  as  Presi-dent at  the  dinner  of  the  Artists '  Cricket  Club ,  in  May ,  having  previ-ously had  his  usual  Chelsea  Lodge  dinner  for  certain  of  its  members ,which  was  always  followed  by  their  business  meeting  in  the  studio.H  e  had  the  promised ' '  little  meeti  ng  "  of  a  number  of  Academicians ,thattheymightdiscussthescholarshipforRomeandotherproblems,and  on  May  1 8th  he  had  a  very  happy  day  at  Cornbury  Park,  part  ofWychwood  Forest,  in  Oxfordshire,  where  he  went  for  the  weddingof  his  young  friend,  Rosalind,  the  elder  daughter  of  Mr.  and  LadyMargaret  W  atney .On  a  lovely  day  early  in  June  Abbey  motored  down  toWoodcoteManor  for  what  proved  to  be  his  last  visit  there,  and  although  he  wasthen  visibly  ailing  neither  he  nor  Mrs.  Abbey  dreamed  of  the  catas-trophe so  near  at  hand.  A  few  days  later  Sir  William  Osier  and  Mr.Donald  Armour  held  a  consultation  and  decided  that  an  investiga-tory operation  was  necessary,  but  when  Abbey  was  told  of  this  herefused  to  believe  that  it  was  anything  serious.  "It  can't  be  that!  Ihave  so  much  work  to  do,"  he  said,  "and  I  feel  so  capable  of  doingit!"  Nor  would  he  allow  a  dinner  party  at  Chelsea  Lodge,  fixed  forJune  Qth  to  be  put  off.  The  invitations  had  been  sent  out  some  time4 8 6ILLNESSbefore,  and  Abbey,  eager  as  ever  to  see  his  friends,  was  unwillingthat  they  should  be  cancelled.  In  the  meantime  Mrs.  Abbey  hadcabled  to  Abbey's  friend  and  correspondent,  Dr.  White,  one  of  themost  eminent  surgeons  in  America,  but  now  retired,  who  was  goingto  St.Moritz  in  any  case  in  July,  begging  him  to  come  to  them  atonce,  and  this  he  did  and  was  present,  with  Sir  William  Osier  andMr.Armour,when,onJune25thSirBerkeleyMoynihanperformedthe  investigatory  operation,  and  he  remained  for  a  fortnight  after,until  Abbey  had  sufficiently  recovered  from  its  effects.  There  wasno  hope.  The  surgeons  found  that  nothing  could  be  done,  the  liverhaving  become  affected,  and  the  end  was  a  matter  of  only  weeks.Abbey  not  having  been  made  aware  of  his  condition,  thought  thattheextreme  heat, which  in  1911  began  earlyin  May  and  continuedthrough  the  summer,  was  the  cause  of  his  slow  convalescence;  andhe  continued  to  make  plans  for  future  work,  dictating  among  otherletters  an  order  for  £50  worth  of  colours .  (These  after  his  death  weredistributed  among  his  young  artists.)  His  thoughts  were  much  seton  the  new  home,  andhefound  interesting  beguilement  in  choosingWilliam  Morris  chintzes.  Among  the  many  flowers  sent  to  him  byfriends  he  found  delight  in  a  blue  hydrangea  brought  by  Alfred  Par-sons. He  enjoyed  short  visits  from  old  and  intimate  friends  and  tookpleasure  in  following  the  cricket  news  and  listening  to  the  booksread  aloud  to  him —  The  Broad  Highway,  Queed,  The  Blue  Lagoon,the  last  not  quite  finished  on  the  day  before  he  became  unconscious .His  last  dictated  letter  that  has  come  to  light  was  to  his  old  associateat  Harpers', Mr  J.E.Kelly, who  had  happened  to  write,  not  know-ing that  he  was  ill.Chelsea  Lodge,"42  Tite  Street,  S.W.,"MY  DEAR  KELLY,  "JulY  X5th,  19"-"I  cannot  tell  you  how  deeply  I  appreciate  your  writing  me  afterall  these  years,  and  especially  what  you  say  about  our  early  days  to-gether— those  early  days  when  everything  seems  possible,  and  whenone's  work  is  the  most  devouringly  interesting  thing  there  is  in  life.You  were  an  exceedingly  good  boy,  and  I  have  no  doubt  that,  with487LAST  DAYSyour  principles,  you  are  just  as  good  a  man.

It  seems  im-possible that  anyone  so  genial  and  so  friendly  to  us  all  should  havepassed  from  us,  and  my  colleagues  will  feel  it  deeply.  To  me  mydear  friend  will  be  a  great  loss,  for  we  were  at  one  in  our  views  about489TRIBUTESart  and  about  Royal  Academy  matters,  and  I  feel  that  we  lose  oneof  our  strongest  members."Among  other  fellow  artists'  testimonies  are  these:From  Luke  Fildes,  R.A.:  "He  possessed  qualities  that  endearedhim  to  all,  and  in  his  passing  away  we,  and  those  interested  in  art  inhis  adopted  home,  will  mourn  a  dear  friend  and  a  supreme  artist."From  Briton  Riviere,  R.A.:  "When  his  colleagues  and  manyfriends  deplore  your  great  loss  and  theirs,  the  first  thought  is  thatit  seems  so  hard  that  this  should  have  taken  place  in  the  midst  ofhis  prime,  but  when  one  remembers  the  fulness  and  remarkableactivity  of  his  career ,  our  only  wonder  is  that  his  strength  and  vitality,fresh  as  they  were,  could  have  lasted  so  long."From  J.

I  dare  say  this  is  being  said  at  this  mo-ment by  countless  people."And  finally  this  tribute  of  Henry  James,  who  survived  his  friendonly  until  1915:  "My  desi  re  you  should  know  how  tenderly  and  faith-fully I  think  of  you  and  of  him  is  greaterthan  my  sense  of  the  weaknessof  all  words.  .  .One  can  but  stretch  out  one's  hand.  .  .lean  only  won-der at  the  cruelty  and  perversity  of  his  extinction — to  say  nothing  ofhis  suffering.

G.  Simmonds,  Abbey's  formerassistant,  who,  after  the  canvases  had  been  set  in  place,  was  to  touchup,  where  necessary,  any  blemishes  caused  in  fixing  them  upon  thewalls.Having  acceded  to  the  request  of  the  President  and  Council  of  theRoyal  Academy  that  there  should  be  a  memorial  exhibition  of  Ab-bey's works  in  the  winter  of  191 1-1912, Mrs.  Abbey  collected  for  thepurpose  drawings  in  black-and-white  and  paintings  in  oil,  water-colour  and  pastel,  many  of  them  sent  from  America,  and  from  thiscollection,  at  her  request,  Mr.  Sargent  selected  the  322  works  exhi-bited on  that  occasion.  This  large  number  represented  only  a  por-tion of  Abbey's  life  work.  Nothing  was  to  be  seen  there  from  the"Holy  GraiP'frieze  in  Boston,  and  only  three  small  designs  for  thework  in  Harrisburg.On  March  i3th,  191 7,  a  tablet  in  Abbey's  honour  was  unveiled  inthe  crypt  of  St .  Paul 's  by  the  Princess  Louise ,  after  which  addresseswere  given  bythe  late  SirEdwardPoynter,P.R.A.,andbythelateDr.  Page,  the  American  Ambassador.  The  words  on  the  tablet,which  was  designed  by  Alfred  Parsons, are  these:  "To  the  Memoryof  Edwin  Austin  Abbey,  Royal  Academician,  who  was  born  in  Phil-adelphia, Pennsylvania,  on  the  first  of  April,  1852,  and  who  died  inLondon  on  the  first  of  August,  1911,  beloved  both  in  the  Countryof  his  Birth  and  in  that  of  his  Adoption,  this  tablet  is  erected  by  hisFriends  and  his  Admirers."In  1 9 1 8  a  tablet,  designed  by  the  late  Albert  H .

H.  SMITH  &  SONConcerning  Edwin  A.  Abbey's  Last  WorkNotes  made  by  Mrs.  E.  A.  Abbey  showing  Mr.  Sargent's  connection  with  thefinishing  of  Edwin  A.  Abbey's  last  work  for  the  Pennsylvania  Capitol  of  Harris-burg  ;  followed  by  a  letter  from  the  now  well-known  Mr.  W.  G.  Simmonds,  whoat  that  time  was  E.  A.  Abbey's  assistant.In  the"North  American  Quarterly  Review"  for  June,  1925,  Mr.Edwin  H.  Blashfield,  President  of  the  National  Academy  ofDesign  in  New  York,  writes  of  his  friends,  J.  S.  Sargent  andEdwin  A.  Abbey,  as  follows  :"  When  Abbey's  hand  was  arrested  in  the  midst  of  his  decora-tive work  for  the  Pennsylvania  Capitol  of  Harrisburg,  Sargenthurriedly  made  a  long  journey  to  superintend  the  completion  ofsome  of  the  panels,  superintending,  nota  bene,  with  a  carefulavoidance  of  personally  touching  a  brush  to  the  canvas."Mr.  Sargent  superintended  only  an  alteration  on  one  panel,  andfrom  studies  made  by  my  husband.Onpageu8of"BrushandPencil,"byMr.G.PJacomb-Hood,published  May  28th,  1925,  by  Mr.  John  Murray,  shortly  afterMr.  Sargent's  death,  Mr.  Hood  writes  of  him  in  the  followingwords  :  '  When  his  friend,  Edwin  Abbey,  was  stricken  by  theillness  that  proved  fatal,  Sargent,  as  a  matter  of  course,  gave  uphis  holiday  in  Tyrol  and  came  back  in  a  very  hot  summer  to  workday  after  day  finishing  the  large  decoration  for  America  onwhich  Abbey  had  been  occupied."No  doubt  there  are  many  similar  paragraphs  passing  throughthe  press  which  I  shall  never  see,  but  the  paragraphs  which  Ihave  quoted  above  have  been  written  by  well-known  men — menwho  were  not  only  of  my  husband's  day,  but  were  his  personalfriends  for  many  years  ;  and  for  this  very  reason,  it  will  be  takenfor  granted  by  future  generations  who  may  make  researches  intothe  Art  of  to-day,  that  those  friends  of  his  own  day  would  morethan  any  other  writers  be  fully  acquainted  with  the  facts,  and,also,  would  have  set  down  their  statements  with  all  accuracy.Their  writings  will  certainly  be  constantly  examined  in  the  yearsto  come  ;  and  unless  certain  statements  in  these  quoted  para-graphs  are  contradicted  now,  they  will  in  future  years  be  copiedas  facts  into  all  that  is  published  about  these  two  men  of  to-day,until  finally  it  will  come  to  be  believed  for  all  time  that,  as  Mr.Sargent  in  that  hot  summer  of  1911  had  worked  "  day  after  dayfinishing  "  the  large  decoration  by  my  husband,  he  must  havedone  a  vast  amount  of  work  upon  the  various  canvases  whichwere  awaiting  delivery  to  the  Capitol  of  Pennsylvania,  whereas,as  will  be  seen,  he  was  here  but  a  few  days  only,  superintendingthe  alteration  on  only  one  of  the  canvases  from  studies  made  bymy  husband.To  prevent  what  is  not  in  accordance  with  fact  from  beingaccepted  as  such,  either  to-day  or  in  the  days  to  come,  with  re-gard to  the  completion  of  my  husband's  last  works  upon  whichhe  had  been  occupied  for  several  years,  I  owe  it  to  his  memoryto  state  the  exact  facts  (which  perhaps  no  one  except  those  im-mediately concerned  knew  at  the  time  or  have  ever  known  since),and  I  will  state  them  almost  wholly  in  Mr.  Sargent's  own  words,written  or  telegraphed  to  me  at  the  time.My  husband  had  already  delivered,  in  1908,  four  large  can-vases— lunettes — each  thirty-eight  feet  by  twenty-two  feet,  andfour  circular  canvases,  each  fourteen  feet  in  diameter,  and  theyhad  been  duly  put  in  place  in  the  Capitol  of  Pennsylvania,  hisnative  state.  Towards  the  end  of  April,  1911,  four  more  can-vases were  practically  ready  for  delivery  to  the  Capitol,  andwere  then  removed  from  his  studio  at  Morgan  Hall,  Fairford,Gloucestershire,  and  set  up  in  London  at  Machinery  Hall  in  theWhite  City,  Shepherd's  Bush.  These  four  canvases  were  :  (i)"  The  Camp  of  the  American  Army  at  Valley  Forge,  February,1778,"  twelve  feet  six  inches  by  six  feet,  intended  for  the  SenateChamber  of  the  Capitol.  This  was  completed  in  1910,  morethan  a  year  before  his  death,  and  was  exhibited  in  the  1910Summer  Exhibition  at  the  Royal  Academy.  The  following  (2,3  and  4)  were  the  decoration  for  the  House  of  Representativesof  the  Capitol  :  (2)  "  Penn's  Treaty  with  the  Indians,"  twenty-four  feet  by  twelve  feet,  also  completed  in  1910  and  also  exhi-bited at  the  R.A.  of  that  year  ;  (3)  "  The  Hours,"  a  ceilingtwenty-four  feet  in  diameter,  completed  in  1910  or  early  in  1911,before  it  was  removed  from  the  Morgan  Hall  Studio  and  set  upin  Machinery  Hall  ;  and  (4)  "  The  Apotheosis  of  Pennsylvania,"thirty-five  feet  square,  which  was  practically  completed  in  theMorgan  Hall  Studio  ;  but  this  studio  was  in  its  highest  part  (atthe  ridge)  only  twenty-four  feet  and,  consequently,  he  had  neverseen  the  whole  of  "  The  Apotheosis  "  at  one  time.  For  workingpurposes  it  had  been  divided  into  three  parts,  and  he  had  seenonly  two  together.  In  order  that  he  might  see  the  three  parts  asa  whole,  before  taking  this  canvas  to  its  destination,  and  mightsee  it  also  in  conjunction  with  the  other  three  canvases,  he  tookthem  all  to  Machinery  Hall,  and  here  the  three  parts  of  "  TheApotheosis  "  were  bolted  together  and,  then,  for  the  first  time,he  could  see  them  as  one  canvas.  He  at  once  saw  possibilitiesof  certain  comparatively  small  improvements,  and  these  im-provements he  immediately  set  to  work  upon  and  completed.On  the  last  day,  however,  that  he  was  able  to  visit  the  WhiteCity,  little  thinking  that  it  was  to  be  his  last  visit  there,  he  sud-denly saw  the  possibility  of  a  further  improvement,  and  he  re-turned to  his  Chelsea  Lodge  Studio  and  made  there  the  studiesfrom  which  he  proposed  to  carry  out  the  alteration  on  the  largecanvas  in  Machinery  Hall.  It  was  to  superintend  the  carryingout  of  this  comparatively  small  alteration  that  Mr.  Sargent  re-turned from  Munich  to  London.In  order  to  paint  on  the  big  canvas  at  the  White  City  it  wasnecessary  for  the  painter  to  climb  up  a  high  telescopic  ladder,and  then  having  painted  a  certain  space  to  descend  to  the  groundand  walk  a  considerable  distance  away  from  the  canvas  in  orderto  see  the  effect  from  below.  This  was  naturally  very  slow  andexhausting  work,  but  towards  the  last  my  husband  was  providedwith  a  megaphone,  by  means  of  which  he  could,  from  theground,  direct  his  assistant  on  the  turret  above.  He  was  thusable  to  watch  and  criticise  every  stroke  his  assistant  painted  fromthe  study  my  husband  had  previously  made.When  on  Sunday,  June  25th,  1911,  it  was  made  clear  to  me,after  an  investigatory  operation,  that  my  husband  could  not  live,I  wrote  to  Mr.  Sargent  in  Munich,  where  he  then  was,  and  toldhim  the  whole  truth.  The  truth  about  my  husband's  illness  waskept  from  his  friends  and  from  the  press  almost  up  to  the  end,in  order  that  he  should  see  no  reference  in  the  papers  to  the  factthat  he  could  not  live,  and  I  begged  Mr.  Sargent  to  return  toLondon  at  once  and  superintend  the  alteration  made  at  the  lastmoment  on  "  The  Apotheosis  of  Pennsylvania,"  so  that  my  hus-band, who  was  worrying  about  the  delay  in  delivery  which  hisillness  would  cause,  might  be  at  peace  about  the  completion  ofthis  work  during  the  few  days  that  were  left  him  ;  and  also  mighthear  from  Mr.  Sargent's  own  lips  that  this  canvas  had  been  pro-perly finished  from  the  studies  previously  made,  and  that  it  wasready  to  be  sent  to  its  destination.In  an  alphabetical  file,  labelled  "  During  Ned's  Illness,  1911,"into  which  I  had  put  every  written  letter  or  paper,  concerninghim  or  his  work  that  came  here,  is  an  envelope  on  the  outside  ofwhich  is  written  "  Sargent,  during  Ned's  illness,  1911."  Andthis  envelope  contains  the  following  facts: — On  June  29th,  p.m.,he  telegraphed  me  from  Munich  :  "  Will  return  Friday,  Sar-gent." He  duly  arrived  on  Friday  evening,  the  3Oth,  and  wenton  Saturday  morning,  July  ist,  for  part  of  the  day,  to  MachineryHall,  which  was  not  being  used  for  exhibition  purposes  thatseason.  On  Sunday,  July  2nd,  and  Sunday,  July  9th,  the  placewas  closed  and  he  could  not  go  there.  Thursday,  July  i3th,having  seen  to  all  that  was  necessary,  he  went  there  for  the  lasttime,  and  on  the  morning  of  the  i5th  he  left  London,  with  hissisters  and  Mrs.  Fred  Barnard  and  Miss  Barnard,  for  the  top  ofthe  Simplon,  where  he  remained  until  well  into  September.  OnFriday,  July  yth,  he  had  written  me  :  "  I  have  just  been  telephonedto  from  Clarence  House.  Prince  Arthur  of  Connaught  wants  asitting  to-morrow  morning,  so  I  won't  be  able  to  go  (to  theWhite  City)  to-morrow  morning."  There  were  other  sittings,but  it  was  seldom  necessary  for  him  to  be  at  Machinery  Hall  formore  than  part  of  the  day.  On  Thursday,  July  i3th,  Mr.  Sargentwrote  me:  "  I  have  accomplished  a  lot  to-day  and  have  directedfurther  small  things.  I  doubt  if  I  can  get  time  again  to-morrow.I  have  to  go  to  the  Consulate  in  the  City,  pack,  etc.,  and  am  offon  Saturday  (July  i5th)."  On  Friday,  July  i4th,  Mrs.  Barnardhad  written  me:  "We  start  to-morrow  for  the  Simplon  with  theSargents . "  So  that  this  made  at  most  only  parts  of  eleven  days  onwhich  Mr.  Sargent  could  possibly  have  superintended  these  works.On  August  ist  my  husband  died.  He  had  seen  Mr.  Sargentonly  once,  but  he  knew — and  this  gave  him  great  peace — that,with  Mr.  Sargent  superintending,  the  alteration  would  be  madeto  his  entire  satisfaction.  It  was  not  thought  advisable  that  heshould  be  kept  accurately  informed  as  to  what  was  going  onabout  him,  so  that  anything  he  may  have  said  to  any  friend  whosaw  him  during  Mr.  Sargent's  stay  in  London  could  not  bealtogether  relied  upon.One  other  item,  of  no  importance  in  itself,  should,  perhaps,  alsobe  mentioned  here,  lest  owing  to  some  unforeseen  misstatement  itshould  assume  at  some  future  time  a  similar  inordinate  propor-tion. It  concerns  the  touching  up  of  one  of  the  horses  by  myhusband 's  valued  friend ,  that  fine  artist ,  the  late  Mr .  ArthurLemon .This  was  a  very  minor  matter  necessitated  by  an  alteration,  madewhile  still  at  Fairford,  in  the  relative  positions  of  the  Flag  ofPennsylvania  and  of  the  National  Flag,  as  the  result  of  infor-mation furnished  by  the  War  Department  at  Washington.These  corrections  in  the  flags,  however,  involved  the  touchingup  of  certain  places  on  one  of  the  horses  and,  also,  of  a  bit  of  thesaddle — not  more  than  an  hour's  work  altogether.  My  husbanddecided  that  this  should  be  done  in  London,  for  his  friend,  Mr.Arthur  Lemon,  who  had  made  some  good  studies  of  horses,  hadoffered  to  lend  him  a  study,  but  he  put  off  using  it  until  too  lateand  he  then  asked  Mr.  Lemon  to  do  the  touching  up  for  him.I  told  Mr.  Sargent  about  this  the  evening  he  arrived  in  Lon-don in  case  he  saw  fit  to  superintend  Mr.  Lemon,  who  was  nota  mural  painter.  Mr.  Sargent  had  the  use  of  our  motor  whengoing  to  Machinery  Hall,  and  in  a  note  to  me  on  anothermorning  he  wrote  :  "  I  am  going  to  pick  up  Lemon."I  know  that  my  husband  would  have  wished  any  statementcorrected  which  gave  the  impression  that  either  his  assistant  orMr.  Sargent  had  done  a  great  amount  of  work  on  these  can-vases, because,  in  all  essentials,  he  had  completed  them  himself.His  assistant  had  never  at  any  time  been  in  the  habit  of  paintingany  important  part  of  any  of  his  designs,  not  even  with  my  hus-band himself  superintending.  There  was  on  this  occasion,  how-ever, nothing  of  very  great  importance  to  complete,  nothing  thatan  assistant,  trained  in  the  schools  as  a  painter  and  with  somestudio  practice  in  mural  painting,  could  not  do  under  the  super-vision of  a  master  and  with  the  master's  study  before  him.Neither  my  husband  nor  I  would  have  been  otherwise  thanproud  to  have  Mr.  Sargent  paint  directly  on  that  canvas  had  hechosen  to  do  so.  He  had  full  authority  from  me  to  do  whateverhe  thought  best  to  complete  the  "Apotheosis, "my  one  desire  beingthat  my  husband  could  be  told  that  it  was  finished  so  that  hemight  cease  from  troubling,  but  Mr.  Sargent  did  not  see  fit  todo  otherwise  than  simply  to  superintend.  He  did  not  think  itnecessary  to  climb  up  and  down  that  high  and  difficult  and  tiringladder  himself,  for  there  was  no  scaffolding  and,  under  thoseconditions,  it  took  much  time  to  accomplish  a  very  little  work  onthat  immense  canvas.From  all  that  I  have  set  down  here  it  will  be  clear  that  of  thefour  canvases  in  Machinery  Hall,  one  canvas  only,  "  The  Apo-theosis of  Pennsylvania,"  thirty-five  feet  square,  which  my  hus-band had  been  at  work  upon  for  several  years,  needed  Mr.Sargent's  presence  in  order  to  superintend  his  last  small  altera-tion. The  only  reason  for  referring  to  the  short  time  he  foundit  necessary  to  spend  there,  is  that  it  proves  that  there  was  solittle  to  be  done  to  complete  the  canvas,  that  there  was  no  reasonfor  him  to  stay  longer,  no  necessity  for  him  to  give  up  more  thana  few  days  of  his  holiday,  and  therefore  no  occasion  for  him  "  ina  very  hot  summer  to  work  day  after  day  finishing  the  largedecoration  for  America  on  which  Abbey  had  been  occupied."Mr.  Sargent's  kindness  and  generous  helpfulness  are  so  wellknown  that  they  need  no  emphasising.  It  was  noble  of  him  tocome  back  to  London  from  Munich  in  that  hot  summer  of  191 1 ,but  being  Sargent  he  could  not  fail  to  come.  "  He  came  as  amatter  of  course."  I  have  never  ceased  and  never  shall  cease  tofeel  the  deepest  gratitude  for  what  he  did  at  that  time — for  thehelp  and  comfort,  beyond  all  estimation,  that  he  was  to  us  both,and  not  only  then,  but  in  after  years,  later  on,  when,  for  myhusband's  sake,  he  often  gave  me  the  benefit  of  his  advice,  andhelped  me  in  the  carrying  out  of  work  of  various  kinds  connectedwith  his  career,  but  this  is  for  the  most  part  recorded  in  the"Life  of  E.  A.  Abbey,"  published  in  November,  1921.MARY  GERTRUDE  ABBEY.  January,  1926.N.B.  Since  writing  the  above  my  attention  has  been  called  to  a  publication  in  whichis  a  paragraph  stating  that  "  Sargent  with  superb  generosity  gave  up  his  summer's  plansand  returned  to  England  to  superintend  the  completion  of  several  of  the  Harrisburgpictures."The  Frith,Far  Oakridge,  Stroud,  Glos.DEAR  MRS.  ABBEY,March  gth,  1926.I  think  this  may  help  to  make  clear  what  happened  during  thefinishing  of  Mr.  Abbey's  last  work,  for,  as  you  will  remember,  Iwas  working  for  him  at  Fairford  until  he  took  the  canvases  toLondon,  and  was  afterwards  with  him  at  the  White  City,  Shep-herd's Bush,  until  the  work  was  finished.  The  large  canvas,"  The  Apotheosis  of  Pennsylvania,"  was  completed  at  Fairfordon  three  separate  sections  of  canvas,  and  the  whole  was  put  to-gether for  the  first  time  in  the  Machinery  Hall  at  the  White  City,where  Mr.  Abbey  saw  and  discussed  with  me  the  necessity  forslight  modifications,  mostly  of  small  passages  of  light  and  shadewhich  would  add  to  the  breadth  of  the  composition.  Where  anychange  in  figures  or  draperies  was  needed  he  made  studies  forthe  purpose.These  small  modifications  were  all  decided  upon  and  thestudies  made  before  Mr.  Abbey's  illness  prevented  him  fromvisiting  the  Machinery  Hall  again.  During  the  time  I  was  work-ing on  the  painting,  before  Mr.  Abbey's  death,  John  Sargentcame  along  to  oversee  the  work  and  report  to  Mr.  Abbey  how  itwas  progressing.  He  came  only  for  a  few  days,  less  than  a  fort-night. On  a  few  visits  he  spent  perhaps  three  hours  there,  butusually  he  stayed  only  about  an  hour,  and  never  that  I  remem-ber did  he  stay  a  whole  day,  or  come  twice  in  a  day,  and  I  wasthere  all  the  time.  He  thought  the  shadow  on  William  Penn'sforehead,  underneath  his  Quaker  hat,  needed  strengthening,  andas  Mr.  Abbey  had  left  no  study  for  this,  he  made  a  charcoal  studyof  my  face  with  a  piece  of  cardboard  round  my  head  for  aQuaker  hat  brim  that  I  might  use  it  for  this  alteration.One  morning  he  brought  Mr.  Arthur  Lemon  and  left  himthere  to  touch  up  the  foreground  horse.  For  anyone  more  orless  accustomed  to  mural  painting  there  was  not  more  than  anhour's  work  on  the  horse,  but  Mr.  Lemon  was  a  painter  of  com-paratively small  pictures  and  he  had  brought  with  him  very  smallbrushes,  so  that  he  stayed  well  into  the  afternoon  before  his  workwas  finished.  Compared  with  the  rest  of  the  canvas  this,  hispainting,  was  very  smooth,  and  Mr.  Sargent  afterwards  suggestedthat  I  should  climb  up  and  lay  on  a  few  brush  marks,  which  I  did.John  Sargent  may  have  done  a  few  touches  at  the  bottom  ofthe  canvas,  but  very  few,  most  of  the  canvas  being  out  of  reachwithout  the  aid  of  a  telescopic  ladder  which  would  have  beendifficult  if  not  dangerous  for  a  man  of  his  weight  and  proportionsto  climb.  I  think  Sargent  never  intended  or  desired  to  work  onthe  painting,  the  chief  reason  for  his  visits  being  to  oversee  thework  and  report  and  give  Mr.  Abbey  assurance  that  it  was  beingproperly  completed.  He  left  England  before  Mr.  Abbey's  death.You  will  remember  that  the  other  three  canvases  at  the  WhiteCity  had  all  been  finished  before  they  were  removed  from  Fair-ford,  and  two  of  them  had  been  exhibited  at  the  Royal  Academythe  previous  year.Yours  sincerely,WILLIAM  G.
