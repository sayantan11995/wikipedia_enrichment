{"Early_life": "\n    Little is known of Pope Adrian IV's background, and much of what is known is brought to historians by the writings of Cardinal Boso and William of Newburgh, both of whom were writing over 30 years after Breakspear's death. As a result, there is a dearth of information, especially dates, for Breakspear's life until his election as pope in 1154. The English chronicler Matthew Paris claims that Adrian IV was born at Abbots Langley, in or around the Hertfordshire town, although Paris mistakenly ascribes his father the name Robert de Camera. It is not clear if this is true, but it is known that Adrian IV did come from Abbots Langley, and it is believed that he may have been a clerk or priest. He had a brother, a clerk in Feering, Essex. Despite his inauspicious background, Adrian IV rose to become pope and ruled from 1154 to 1159. He is known for his support of the Church of England and his attempt to assert the pope's authority over the English Church. However, this was met with resistance from the English nobility and his rule was marked by a number of conflicts and disagreements. Ultimately, Adrian IV was unable to maintain his authority and was forced to resign in 1159.", "Move_to_France_and_promotion": "\n    Adrian IV was born as Stephen Langton in 1125 or 1126 in Gloucestershire, England. He is believed to have studied at Merton College in Oxford, where he was influenced by the reformist ideas of Peter Lombard and John of Salisbury. He later became a canon regular at the Abbey of Saint-Ruf in Avignon, France, where he was a prior and then abbot. While still a canon, he was summoned to Rome due to complaints from the monks of the abbey, and it is believed that he met John of Salisbury in Rheims. Breakspear was eventually promoted to Cardinal-Bishop of Albano by Pope Eugenius III, becoming only the second Englishman to be elevated to this rank. He attended the Council of Reims and later became Pope Adrian IV. As Pope, he authorized the cutting of stone and columns from the chapter of Pisa Cathedral.", "Voyage_to_Catalonia": "\n    It was probably at the Council of Reims that Eugenius selected Breakspear for a mission to Catalonia,[29][note 9] possibly as a kind of unofficial legate to the crusaders. Breakspear met Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona who had been waging the latest campaign against the Moors since 1147. Although no records exist to show Breakspear was involved in the campaign itself, he was heavily involved in the reorganisation and administration of the Cistercian Order, as well as arbitrating disputes within its congregation. He is less likely to have still been there in October, when it fell, as he had returned to Rome by December. However, he may well have brought news of another successful siege\u2014that of Tortosa\u2014which would have been particularly welcome to the \"bruised and battered\" papacy of Eugenius, says Damian Smith.[35] Smith also notes that Breakspear's lengthy absence from St Ruf may have been a source of complaint by his monks, \"but this was surely not of prime importance to the Pope.\" Egger suggests, however, that Breakspear's Catalonian mission was of great benefit to St Ruf, which became the blueprint for the religious houses created by Berenguer in the wake of the retreating Muslim empire.[36][note 10]\n\n    Around mid-1152, he was despatched to Scandinavia as Papal legate, where he was instrumental in the re-establishment of the archbishopric of Uppsala and the election of Archbishop Ingvar as its new head. He also played a key role in the resolution of conflicts between the archbishopric and the secular authorities, as well as in the conversion of the pagan populations of the region to Christianity. His efforts in the latter area, which included the translation of several liturgical texts into Old Norse, were particularly successful, and he is remembered as a pioneer of Christian missionary activity in Scandinavia.\n    Overall, it can be said that Breakspear's mission to Catalonia and his subsequent journey to Scandinavia were significant contributions to the development of the Catholic Church. His efforts in reorganizing the Cistercian Order and resolving conflicts within its congregation in Catalonia helped to strengthen the Church's position in the region, while his successful mission to Scandinavia paved the way for the establishment of Christianity in the region and contributed to the growth of the Church in Europe as a whole.", "Visit_to_Scandinavia,_1152": "\n\n    Pope Adrian IV was a skilled diplomat and administrator, as evidenced by his successful mission to Norway and Sweden. During his time in northern Europe, he reconciled warring factions, restored the monarchy, and reorganized the church along Italian and European lines. He traveled to Norway via France and England and may have recruited merchant contacts who knew the region. His activities in Norway earned him the praise of contemporary Icelandic writer and politician, Snorri Sturluson. If the Council of Nidaros was held in the early months of 1153, suggests Bergquist, then it appears that Breakspear sailed to Sweden as soon as it was concluded. His activities in Sweden followed a similar course to those in Norway, with him calling another council, reorganizing the church, and attempting to create an archepiscopal see for Sweden. Despite his efforts, however, one of the three provinces, Gothland, opposed the venture and it came to nothing. Breakspear appears to have repaired relations with the recently returned Archbishop Eskil and placed him in charge of the new Swedish metropolitan. Breakspear's legation in the north has been described as a \"diplomatic triumph\" and he is later considered the apostle of Scandinavia. Boso later lauded how Breakspear brought \"peace to the kingdoms, law to the barbarians, tranquillity to the monasteries, order to the churches, discipline to the clergy and a people pleasing to God, devoted to good works.\" He successfully introduced a new Scandinavian tythe, the denarium sancti Petri, and gave the Swedish church its hierarchy and attachment to Rome.", "Political_background": "\n\n    Adrian's election to the papacy came at a time of great upheaval and change, as the traditional power structures were being challenged by the educated laity and new forces were emerging. This period of change brought with it restlessness, crises, stress, and tension, as the old was being pushed out by the new. In the wake of Eugenius' death, Barbarossa, the Hohenstaufen Emperor, had been elected Holy Roman Emperor in March 1152. This new emperor presented a challenge to the papacy, as the two sought to assert their respective authority over the city of Rome, the new emperor marching towards Rome for his coronation and the Pope's counterpart in the east, who was invading southern Italy. Additionally, the Pope faced resistance from the city of Rome, which had recognized itself as a republican commune since 1144. This republican government had recognized Eugenius as Pope the following year, but it was hostile to the Papacy and had a popular heretic ruler, Arnold of Brescia, who was supported by the Roman Commune. Despite this, the Pope was able to maintain his authority and negotiate peace between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire, as well as the Byzantine Empire, through a mutual assistance pact, which was confirmed in January 1155. This pact stipulated that the crowning of the next emperor was contingent on expelling Arnold of Brescia from Rome, and ensured each party of the other's support", "Election,_1154": "\n\n    Pope Adrian IV's unanimous election by the cardinals on 4 December 1154 was not the only factor that propelled him to the Papal throne. His being \"in the right place at the right time\" is also considered a crucial factor in his election. As suggested by papal librarian Bradford Lee Eden, Breakspear's election was a result of a combination of factors, including his exceptional qualities and being in the right place at the right time. His election took place during a crisis for the papacy, and he was one of the few popes of his era who did not need consecrating on his election, as he was already a bishop. Despite being elected unanimously from among the cardinals, the role of the Roman people was ignored, which led to poor relations with the city and the King of Sicily who controlled much of southern Italy. As a result, Adrian was forced to remain in the Leonine City and was unable to complete the enthronement ceremony immediately. It is probable that due to these problematic relations, he did not receive his crown until the following Easter.", "Neutralises_Rome": "\n\n    Adrian IV was elected as Pope in 1187 and faced opposition from the people and the Commune of Rome. Despite this, Adrian remained committed to maintaining Papal rule and sought to control Emperor Frederick Barbarossa through military force. This strategy proved successful as the Emperor needed the Pope's coronation service and the Pope needed the Emperor's military support. However, the Pope's actions were met with opposition from the local populace, who were xenophobic and hostile to foreign rulers. Despite the challenges, Adrian managed to expel Arnold of Brescia and regain Papal authority in Rome. However, the principle of republicanism remained firmly established in the city, making it difficult for the Pope to maintain control. Adrian's hardline stance against the Roman Commune, coupled with his expulsion of Arnold of Brescia, was a testament to his courage and determination to uphold Papal rule in Rome.", "Neutralises_Arnold": "\n\n    \"Pope Adrian IV's efforts to secure the support of the Emperor were not limited to his attempts to capture the heretic Arnold. In fact, he had been actively campaigning for the Emperor's assistance in his efforts to maintain control over Rome and the surrounding territories. This campaign was largely successful, and Barbarossa was more than willing to assist the Pope in his efforts to maintain his grip on the city.\"", "Imperial_trouble_at_Sutri,_late_1155": "\n\n    Adrian IV was a pope who served from 1151 to 1159, and his reign was characterized by a number of controversies and disputes, particularly with the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick Barbarossa. Barbarossa had received the Iron Crown of Lombardy\u2014as King of Italy\u2014in Pavia, but also wished to receive his Imperial Crown from the Pope. Adrian originally saw the Emperor as protector and defender of the church, but the imperial coronation on 18 June 1155 had to be performed secretly on a Saturday due to fears of Roman hostility and disturbances. The meeting between Adrian and Barbarossa at Sutri in early June 1155 turned out to be a contest between the two parties to gain propaganda supremacy, and the confusion at Sutri may have been accidental. The painting of Emperor Luthar in the Lateran, which described the Emperor as a liegeman of the Pope, caused indignation in Emperor Barbarossa, who made a \"friendly reproach\" to the Pope in a letter to a German bishop. Despite Adrian's attempts to remove the painting, it became a fundamental cause of the dispute between the Pope and the Emperor.", "Imperial_coronation,_1155": "\n\n    Pope Adrian IV's coronation by Emperor Frederick II Barbarossa in 1158 was a significant event not only for the Papacy but also for Germany. While the Emperor eventually agreed to perform the necessary services, he did so reluctantly. The coronation took place in Nepi on June 18, 1158, and both the Pope and Emperor wore their crowns. The ceremony was a new version of the traditional one and highlighted the difference between the anointing of a layman and that of a priest. During the ceremony, Adrian anointed Barbarossa between the shoulders and invested him with a sword, emphasizing his role as the defender of the Papacy and its privileges. However, the Pope disallowed his chancery from addressing the Emperor by either of his preferred titles, and it may be that he was overreacting to what he perceived as a slight. \n\n    Following the coronation, both parties appear to have taken extra care to abide by the Treaty of Constance, which had established the relationship between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. However, tensions remained high between the two, and the Pope's relations with the German Empire were still fraught. The Emperor's failure to suppress the Roman commune for Adrian led the Pope to believe that the Emperor had broken the treaty. Furthermore, the Emperor's army sacked Spoleto during his march to the north, leaving the Pope in virtual exile in Viterbo. Despite the challenges, Pope Adrian IV continued to work for the betterment of the Papacy and played a crucial role in the development of Western civilization.", "Normans,_Greeks_and_Apulians": "\n\n    Adrian IV, the Holy Roman Emperor, was known for his efforts to strengthen the position of the Holy Roman Empire in Europe. In addition to his political pursuits, Adrian IV also had a personal interest in the affairs of the Italian peninsula. This was reflected in his support for the rebels who were fighting against the King of Sicily. Despite his efforts to help the rebels, Adrian IV's alliance with them was ultimately unsuccessful. This failure was due in part to the fact that the King of Sicily was able to rally the support of other powerful figures in Europe, such as the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I. Ultimately, Adrian IV's efforts to strengthen the position of the Holy Roman Empire were not successful, and the Italian peninsula remained under the control of the King of Sicily.", "Alliance_with_Manuel_I,_1156": "\n    Adrian IV's military campaign against William was a result of Manuel I's invitation to join forces against the Norman invasion. However, Manuel's ambition of uniting the Eastern and Western Roman Empires led to a conflict of interests with Adrian, as the latter believed in the subjugation of the Eastern Church to the Western Church. Despite attempts at negotiation, Manuel's offer to pay Adrian a large sum of money in return for ceding certain Apulian cities was never actioned. Adrian's failure to establish a permanent alliance with Manuel ultimately led to his downfall.", "Norman_victory": "\n\n    Adrian IV, also known as Nicholas Breakspear, was Pope from 1154 to 1159. During his papacy, he faced several external threats that required him to make significant concessions to maintain the stability of the Church. Adrian had been elected to the papacy in a disputed election and faced opposition from several powerful figures, including Frederick Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor, and King William I of Sicily.\n\nAdrian IV's relationship with William I of Sicily was particularly challenging. The King's position was not looking good, and he offered Adrian large sums in financial compensation for the Pope to withdraw his forces. However, the majority of Adrian's curia were averse to holding negotiations with the Sicilians, and the King's offer was rejected somewhat haughtily. This turned out to be a bad mistake, as William soon won decisive victories over both Greek and Apulian armies in mid-1156 and culminating in the final defeat of the Eastern Empire at the Battle of Brindisi.\n\nWhen William soundly defeated the rebels, Adrian, who was by now bogged down in the problem of Rome, had to sue for peace on the King's terms. This was yet another external event that Adrian had had no way of influencing but had to deal with its consequences. The defeat of Manuel's army left the Pope vulnerable, and he was forced to negotiate with the Sicilian King on generous terms, including \"homage and fealty, reparation for the recent encroachments on the papal patrimony, help against the Romans, freedom from royal control for the Sicilian church\".\n\nAdrian's alliance with William exacerbated relations with Barbarossa, who believed that Adrian had broken the Treaty of Constance twice over, by allying with both King William and the Byzantine Emperor. Relations between Pope and Emperor were \"irreparably damaged\" as a result, and the defeat of Manuel's army left the Pope vulnerable to future external threats. Despite facing significant opposition, Adrian managed to maintain the stability of the Church and make concessions in order to achieve peace and stability.", "Problems_in_translation,_1157": "\n\n    In his letter, Adrian also accused Rainald of Dassel of being a \"wicked counsellor\" and accused the Emperor of being \"negligent\" in the matter. The legates, Roland and Bernard, were met \"with honour and kindness\" in Barbarossa's presence, but the Emperor was visibly upset by Adrian's rebuke for not doing enough to release Eskil, Archbishop of Lund who had been captured in Imperial territory. Adrian's defence of Eskil further damaged his relationship with Barbarossa.\n\n    Despite the tension between the two leaders, they continued to correspond, and in 1161 the Emperor and the Pope came to an agreement to end the conflict between the two states, with Barbarossa promising to release the papal legate in Milan. However, in 1174, Barbarossa again attacked the papacy, leading to an excommunication of the Emperor by the Pope. This event marked the beginning of a series of conflictual exchanges between the two leaders until the Emperor's death in 1190. \n\n    Adrian's reign also saw the emergence of a new form of political power in Rome. With the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the papacy emerged as a major political force in Europe. Adrian's reign saw the establishment of the papal army, which was made up of soldiers from various regions under the control of the papacy. The army was used to defend Rome and to expand the papal territories. Adrian also established the College of Cardinals as the highest advisory body of the papacy, which helped him to govern the church.\n\n    In summary, Adrian IV was a complex personality who faced numerous challenges during his reign, but was able to maintain his position of power and influence in Rome. His reign saw the emergence of a new form of political power in Rome and the establishment of the papal army, and he was instrumental in resolving many conflicts within the Church and between the Church and secular powers.", "Retranslation": "\n\n    Pope Adrian IV played a significant role in the political and religious tensions between the Holy Roman Empire and the Papal States in the 12th century. In June 1158, representatives from both sides met in the Imperial town of Augsburg to discuss their differences. Adrian attempted to pacify the Emperor and claimed that he meant, not \"fief\", but \"good deed\": \"Among us beneficium means not a fief but a good deed\", he wrote. However, Barber suggests that his explanation was far from convincing. On the other hand, notes John Freed, Barbarossa was illiterate and required everything translated. This could have led to mistranslations, and it is possible that the phrase \"Among us beneficium means not a fief but a good deed\" was mistranslated. Taken at face value, this phrase appeared to assert that Adrian was the Emperor's feudal overlord, which led to a significant escalation in tension between the two parties.\n\n    However, the mistranslation was likely a deliberate ploy by Rainald of Dassel, the Archchancellor of Barbarossa. Rainald was a multilingual provocateur, and the Chancery of Barbarossa was waging a propaganda war against Adrian. Rainald had earlier condemned Reinauld's election as Archbishop of Cologne, believed him to be nothing less than the Devil's agent, and intended to cause trouble between the Emperor and the Pope. If this was the case, Rainald succeeded, as Barbarossa was only just restrained from sending an army against Adrian. The Emperor did make a public declaration against Adrian, though, calling for his deposition on the grounds that, as the son of a priest, he was an uncanonical pope.\n\n    Duggan summarizes Adrian's Augsburg letter as being concomitant to one's interpretation of the original offence and notes that the context determines everything. If one does not view the Besan\u00e7on letter as deliberately provocative, then there was no withdrawal from that provocation. Abulafia suggests that Adrian's choice of words may have been a \"calculated ambiguity,\" and in the event, Adrian never publicly acknowledged which of the interpretations he had actually intended. This would have allowed him to suggest the Emperor has misunderstood him while allowing the Pope to intimate to his own church that the Emperor was indeed a Papal vassal.\n\n    Despite the improvement in relations after the Augsburg meeting, the fundamental question remained unresolved, as the two parties continued to disagree over various issues. Any improvement in relations was temporary and fell apart again later that year over the appointment of the next Archbishop of Ravenna. The nominations were split between each sides' preferences, and in the event, the Imperial candidate Guido of Biandrate was elected against Adrian's wishes. Additionally, there was increasing disagreement over the traditional fodrum Imperial taxation levied in north Italy. These tensions ultimately paved the way for the conflict between the Holy Roman Empire and the Papal States that would dominate the 19th century.", "Imperial_claims_to_north_Italy": "\n    \n    Adrian IV's opposition to Guido of Biandrate's appointment had caused a strain in his relationship with the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The Emperor's lack of respect towards the Pope, as evidenced by his refusal to place Adrian's name before his own in correspondence, was a significant sign of the tension. Furthermore, the Emperor's aggressive assertion of his claims over Lombardy and the Diet of Roncaglia's issuance of decrees claiming extensive lands in north Italy had caused concern among the Lombard towns and cities, including Milan, which had already been \"half-destroyed\" by the Emperor. In response to this, Adrian rejected the Emperor's claims and gave him 40 days to withdraw them, on pain of excommunication. However, the situation faced by Adrian was severe, as accepting the Emperor's claims would have meant abandoning the whole Italian church. Adrian also had counter-demands, including that the Emperor should desist from sending envoys to Rome without papal permission, and that the Emperor should only be paid the Imperial tax from his Italian lands while in Italy. Unfortunately, these demands were not met, and Adrian died before his 40-day term expired.

For example, he ordered King Henry II to appoint an unknown Hugh to a London prebend in 1156.\n\nIn addition to his patronage of English church and monastic interests, he also granted a \"large dossier of privileges and directives\" to St. Albans Abbey, exempting it from the jurisdiction of its episcopal master, Robert de Chesney, Bishop of Lincoln.

The grant was made in the form of a Papal Bull, and while the nature of the grant and its motivations remain unclear, it is clear that Adrian believed that he had the authority to give the island of Ireland to the English king. Some historians argue that the grant was motivated by a desire to civilize the supposedly unruly Irish, while others suggest that the grant was made in order to create a single head for the Christian faith.

He emphasized the importance of the Western Church being superior to the East Church and believed that his court was the highest court in Christendom, with the Pope being the final court of appeal. Adrian also believed in the supremacy of the Bishops of Rome over the Empire and other churches. He was an able administrator who used able agents to carry out his policies. He had little inclination towards lengthy theoretical discussions, but could be hesitant at times, such as following the radical change of Papal policy at Benevento.

He could be seen as tough and inflexible, but he also had the ability to manipulate people around him. His biographer, Cardinal Boso, described him as \"mild and kindly in bearing, of high character and learning, famous as a preacher, and renowned for his fine voice\".[4] This description suggests that he was an eloquent and accomplished speaker, and was also a skilled preacher. Adrian was a slow and patient individual, but he was also a quick forgiver. This combination of traits made him a beloved figure in Rome and the Patrimony, and it also made him an effective organiser and administrator. Despite being an outsider and lacking the support of an Italian noble house, Adrian was able to attain the apotheosis of his church through his strength of personality and his ability to adapt to his surroundings. His increasing control over Rome and the Patrimony demonstrates his effective leadership and his ability to inspire others to work towards a common goal.", "Death": "\n        During his short reign of just over a year, Pope Adrian IV faced numerous challenges and difficulties. He had to navigate the power struggles between the Holy Roman Emperor and the papacy, as well as the internal divisions within the Church. Adrian was excommunicated by the Emperor, and he had to deal with the threat of imperial intervention in papal affairs.\n        In the months before his death, Adrian was aware of the likelihood of a schism occurring soon after, and he tried to avoid it by making a number of key decisions. For example, he agreed to excommunicate the Emperor in September 1159, even though he did not have the time to judge the request of Scottish legates who had been in Rome that summer. He also blessed his preferred successor, Bernard, Cardinal-Bishop of Porto, who was acceptable to the Emperor. These decisions may have helped to prevent a split in the College of Cardinals and avoid the future schism.\n        Adrian's death in September 1159 marked the end of a tumultuous chapter in the history of the papacy. He was buried in St. Peter's on 4 September 1159, and his tomb was excavated in 1607 by the Italian archaeologist Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi. Grimaldi described the body of Adrian as that of an undersized man, wearing Turkish slippers and a ring with a large emerald, and dressed in a chasuble.\n        Adrian's legacy is still debated among historians, but he is remembered as a man who faced numerous challenges and worked tirelessly to maintain the independence and power of the papacy.", "Later_events": "\n\n    The meeting between Adrian and the city envoys of June 1159 is believed to have discussed the upcoming Papal election.

The schism that followed Adrian's death led to a double election, with \"mutually unacceptable candidates,\" resulting in \"disgraceful scenes\" taking place in Rome. However, peace was eventually established between the Papacy, the Empire, Sicily, and the Byzantine Emperor after Barbarossa was defeated at the Battle of Legnano and the Treaty of Venice was signed the following year. During this time, the Emperor's chancery distributed a series of fake letters in defense of the imperial candidate, which included the one written to Archbishop Hillin of Trier, in which Adrian launched into a diatribe, condemning the German kings who owed everything to the Papacy yet refused to understand that.

Another letter, from the Emperor to the Archbishop, called Adrian's church \"a sea of snakes,\" \"a den of thieves and a house of demons,\" and Adrian himself as \"he who claims to be the Vicar of Peter, but is not.\" These letters are most interesting for indicating what Barbarossa believed to be the most important arguments in the dispute.\n\n    Despite the ongoing conflict, there were also efforts to reestablish peace, such as the meeting between Adrian and the city envoys of June 1159.

Despite his election, Victor IV was not recognized by John of Salisbury, who had previously mocked the Imperial party.
