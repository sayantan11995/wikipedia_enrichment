{"Early_life": "\n    \"Halide Edib was born in Constantinople (later known as Istanbul), Ottoman Empire to a family of high status. Her father, a secretary to the sultan Abdul Hamid II, provided a privileged upbringing that included private tutoring in European and Ottoman literature, religion, philosophy, sociology, music, and multiple languages. She also learned Greek from her neighbors and briefly attended a Greek school in the city. Halide Edib later attended the American College for Girls, where she completed her education in 1901. After graduating, she married Salih Zeki Bey, a mathematician and astronomer, and had two children with him. However, she continued to prioritize her intellectual pursuits and began writing articles on education and women's rights for Tevfik Fikret's newspaper Tan\u0131n and the women's journal Demet. She also published her first novel, Seviye Talip, in 1909.\n\n    Her involvement with the education ministry led her to reform girls' schools in Constantinople, working alongside Nakiye Han\u0131m on changes to curriculum and pedagogy. She taught pedagogy, ethics, and history in various schools, but resigned due to a disagreement over the handling of mosque schools.\n\n    Halide Edib received a divorce from Salih Zeki in 1910 and made her house an intellectual salon, especially for those interested in Turkishness. She became involved with the Turkish Hearths (T\u00fcrk Oca\u011f\u0131) in 1911 and founded the Elevation of Women (Taali-i Nisvan) organization. During World War I, she became a close friend of the Armenian priest and musician Komitas. While Halide Edib was friendly towards him in person, her writings described his music as \"Anatolian\" instead of Armenian and claimed that his music had been stolen from Turks. She also believed that his parents were probably of Turkish descent and that he was an unconsciously Turkish nationalist, despite his Armenian background and nationalist tendencies.\"", "During_World_War_I": " Halide Edib Adivar's role in the Armenian genocide is a controversial topic. While some sources claim that she actively participated in the genocide, others suggest that she was a victim of a misunderstanding of her intentions. In 1916\u20131917, Edib was an inspector for schools in Damascus, Beirut, and the Coll\u00e8ge Saint Joseph in Aintoura, Mount Lebanon. During this time, she witnessed the treatment of hundreds of Armenian, Arab, Assyrian, Maronite, Kurdish, and Turkish orphans at the Coll\u00e8ge Saint Joseph. The students were \"Turkified\" and given Turkish names, and those who resisted the change were punished with beatings and starvation. Emile Joppin, the head priest at the Saint Joseph College in Antoura, wrote in a school magazine that Edib \"helped to run this orphanage of terror in which Armenian children were systematically deprived of their Armenian identity and given new Turkish names, forced to become Muslims and beaten savagely if they were heard to speak Armenian.\" However, some sources, such as Robert Fisk, argue that Edib \"helped to run this orphanage of terror in which Armenian children were systematically deprived of their Armenian identity and given new Turkish names, forced to become Muslims and beaten savagely if they were heard to speak Armenian.\" According to Karnig Panian, a six-year-old Armenian genocide survivor at the orphanage in 1916, Edib's name was changed to the number 551 and she witnessed children who resisted Turkification being punished with beatings and starvation. In a 1918 report, Major Stephen Trowbridge, a British American Red Cross officer who met with surviving orphans, reported that every vestige of the children's Armenian or Kurdish origin was to be done away with.", "During_the_War_of_Independence": "\n\n    Edib's activism did not go unnoticed by the Ottoman authorities. She was imprisoned and exiled several times for her outspoken views, but she remained committed to the cause of Turkish independence. In addition to her activism, Edib was also a prolific writer, authoring numerous books and articles that highlighted the plight of the Turkish people and the need for reform.\n\n    After the end of World War I, Edib and her husband became active in the Turkish National Movement, a group of Turks who sought to create a new nation state in what was then known as Asia Minor. They believed that the only way for Turkey to survive and thrive was to gain independence from the Ottoman Empire and to create its own identity. Edib was one of the main figures of the movement and played a key role in organizing protests and rallies to promote the cause of Turkish independence.\n\n    During the Turkish War of Independence, Edib traveled extensively throughout Anatolia, working closely with the nationalist leadership to report on the front lines and to raise awareness of the atrocities being committed against Turkish civilians by the Greek invaders. She was granted the ranks of first corporal and then sergeant in the nationalist army, in recognition of her service to the cause.\n\n    Edib's writing also played a crucial role in the struggle for Turkish independence. She wrote extensively on the scorched earth policies and atrocities committed by the Greek invaders, and her book The Turkish Ordeal helped to mobilize international public opinion in favor of the Turkish cause.\n\n    Despite the risks, Edib continued to write and to speak out in favor of Turkish independence, even after the war was over. Her legacy as a fearless and passionate advocate for the Turkish people is still felt today, and she is widely regarded as one of the most important figures of Turkish history.\"", "After_the_war": "\n\n    \"Halide Edib Adivar was born to a wealthy and prominent Turkish family. Her father was a prominent figure in the Turkish nationalist movement and her grandfather was a member of the Ottoman Parliament. However, when her husband Adnan Ad\u0131var became involved in the Progressive Republican Party, the family's standing in Turkish society was greatly affected. This led to the family's relocation to Europe, where they lived from 1926 to 1939. During this time, Halide Edib traveled extensively, sharing her experiences and insights with audiences around the world. In 1939, the family returned to Turkey, where Adivar continued to serve as a professor in English literature at the Faculty of Letters in Istanbul, and Edib became a Member of Parliament in 1950. She held this position until 1954. Throughout her life, Halide Edib was known for her advocacy for women's rights, education, and democracy, and her contributions to Turkish literature and culture.
