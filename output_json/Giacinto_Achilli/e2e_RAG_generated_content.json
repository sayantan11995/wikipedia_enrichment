{"Early_life_as_a_priest": "\n    Achilli was born in Celleno, a small town located near Viterbo in the Papal States. He joined the Dominican order in 1819 and was ordained a priest in 1825. He went on to study Sacred Theology at the Roman College of St. Thomas, which later became the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas. In 1840, for opposing the abuses of the Roman Inquisition, Achilli faced a series of disciplinary actions and sanctions, which included allegations of sexual misconduct, including the alleged rape of a 15-year-old girl in Naples. The Roman Inquisition eventually permanently suspended Achilli from the care of souls and sentenced him to three years of penance at a remote monastery in San Nazzaro. However, Achilli escaped and sought asylum in Corfu, which was a British protectorate at the time. There, he claimed to have converted to Protestantism and engaged in anti-Catholic propaganda under the influence of Isaac Lowndes, the Scottish Presbyterian secretary of the Bible Society. He also formed alliances with exiled Italian nationalists. Despite these actions, Achilli was eventually able to return to Italy and continue his religious career.", "Malta_and_England": "\n    In addition to his work as a professor, Achilli was also involved in various religious and cultural movements in London during his time. He was an active member of the Evangelical Alliance, an organization dedicated to promoting Protestantism and spreading the gospel. He was also involved with the Italian Protestant Church in London, which was a hub for Italian immigrants in the city during the 19th century. Through his work and activism, Achilli played a crucial role in introducing Protestantism to Italy and helping to establish a strong community of Italian immigrants in London.\n\n    \n    It is worth noting that Achilli's dismissal from the Protestant College in Malta was not due to any personal misconduct on his part, but rather to the accusations against his fellow preachers and the resulting controversy. Despite this setback, Achilli remained dedicated to his mission and continued to spread the message of Protestantism in Italy, both in London and back home in Malta.", "Risorgimento": "\n\n    Achilli's anti-Catholic and nationalist sentiments were not limited to the Roman Republic, but he continued to spread his message throughout Italy. After the fall of the Roman Republic, he remained in Rome, where he continued to preach and distribute his anti-Catholic and nationalist tracts. Despite his anti-Catholic views, he was able to maintain friendships with many prominent figures of the Catholic Church, including Cardinal Giacomo Antonelli, who helped him to evade arrest. However, Achilli's outspokenness and radical views eventually led to his persecution and imprisonment, which continued even after the fall of the Roman Republic. Despite this, Achilli's legacy continues to be remembered as a key figure of the Italian unification movement and a champion of Protestantism.", "England_and_controversy": " \"The pamphlets published by Achilli's supporters were met with criticism from the Catholic Church in England who accused him of spreading false information and misrepresenting his expulsion from the Catholic Church. In addition, Achilli was also accused of sexual misconduct, which caused controversy and division among the religious community. Despite the legal advice given by Hope-Scott, Newman proceeded to publish the pamphlet, which ultimately led to his being brought before the criminal court and facing a libel charge.\"", "Newman's_trial_for_libel": "\n\n    Achilli offered a compromise, but Newman felt that he could not admit any culpability. Such an admission would damage Wiseman and the wider church, in addition to himself. Newman requested Wiseman for any document he had, but Wiseman, being unworldly, failed to provide anything. In November 1851, Achilli took an oath denying the accusations made against him, which allowed him to bring criminal charges against Newman for defamatory libel. This meant that Newman could face an unlimited fine or a year in prison. \n    The trial began on June 21 and lasted five days. The Attorney-General Sir Frederic Thesiger led for the prosecution, with assistance from Solicitor-General Sir Fitzroy Kelly. Newman was represented by a team of lawyers led by Sir Alexander Cockburn, and Edward Lowth Badeley, who was sympathetic to the Anglo-Catholic faith. Henry Matthews advised Newman to plead justification, that the allegations were true, and the English libel law put the burden of proof on Newman. Newman sent a delegation abroad to collect evidence, and they returned with witnesses from Italy and Malta, willing to testify. \n    However, the presiding judge, John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell, rejected the witnesses' testimony and allegedly fueled the jury's bias against Newman. Campbell was the first judge to allow an inquisition document to be used as evidence in an English court. Despite this, Newman was convicted of libel on June 25, 1852, because he failed to justify 22 out of the 23 charges. He was fined \u00a3100 (equivalent to \u00a311,560 in 2021) on January 31, 1853, and his legal costs (equivalent to \u00a31,387,159 in 2021) were borne by a public subscription among Catholics. The conviction and sentencing of Newman caused great distress to many Catholics, who saw it as an attack on their faith."}
