Aga Khan III's mother, Nawab A'lia Shamsul-Muluk, was a granddaughter of Fath Ali Shah and played a significant role in his early life. After completing his studies at Eton College, he proceeded to the University of Cambridge, where he received his education in the arts and sciences.", "Career": "\n\n    Aga Khan III is not only a religious leader but also a prominent public figure. He was born in Kenya and became the head of the Shi'a Isma'ili Muslims in 1885, at the age of seven, succeeding his father. After his coronation, he traveled to distant countries to meet and advise his followers. He received numerous honors and awards for his public services, including the Knight Commander of the Indian Empire and Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India. In 1906, he founded the All India Muslim League, which later led to the establishment of Pakistan. During World War II, he played an important role in the formation of the Allied forces. He served as a member of the Privy Council and the League of Nations, and was appointed President of the League in 1937. His contributions to Indian constitutional reforms during the Round Table Conferences are also notable.

Notable among these developments were the establishment of numerous social and economic development institutions, especially in the Indian Subcontinent and East Africa. These institutions were established with the aim of improving the quality of life, especially in developing countries. The community celebrated the Golden, Diamond, and Platinum Jubilees of Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah to show their appreciation and affection. The proceeds of these celebrations were used to further develop major social welfare and development institutions in Asia and Africa. In India, social development institutions such as the Diamond Jubilee Trust and Platinum Jubilee Investments Limited were established to assist in the growth of various types of cooperative societies. In Pakistan, the Diamond Jubilee High School for Girls was established in remote northern areas to provide education to girls. Economic development institutions such as the Diamond Jubilee Investment Trust (now Diamond Trust of Kenya) and the Jubilee Insurance Company were also established in East Africa. Organizational reforms were introduced to give Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b communities the means to structure and regulate their affairs. These reforms were built on a communitarian ethic on one hand and a responsible individual conscience with the freedom to negotiate one's own moral commitment and destiny on the other. The community periodically revised these constitutions to address emerging needs and circumstances in diverse settings. Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah was also involved in the Haji Bibi case, where he was questioned about the origin of his followers.", "Religious_and_social_views": "\n    The Aga Khan's religious and social views have been shaped by his deep understanding of the views of Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan and the Aligarh movement. He is widely recognized as an Islamic modernist who advocates for the compatibility of religion and modernity, increased engagement with Western ideas, renewed ijtih\u0101d and ijm\u0101\u02bf, and the importance of education and women's rights. From a religious standpoint, the Aga Khan believes that there is no contradiction between traditional religious beliefs and modernity, and he encourages Muslim societies to embrace modernity. However, he opposes a wholesale replication of Western culture and society, and instead advocates for renewed ijtih\u0101d and ijm\u0101\u2032 (modernist consensus-building) and engagement with Western ideas. He holds a low opinion of traditional religious establishments and their rigidity and formalism, and instead advocates for independent reasoning and consensus-building, and respect for differences of opinion. The Aga Khan's social views focus on the importance of education, the reduction and eradication of poverty, and women's rights, and he has implemented these within his own Ism\u0101\u02bfily community. Overall, the Aga Khan's views have contributed to the progressive and peaceful development of the Ism\u0101\u2032ily community, which is widely recognized as one of the most prosperous branches of Islam in the world today.", "Racehorse_ownership_and_equestrianism": "\n    \"The Aga Khan III was not only an owner of Thoroughbred racing horses but also a successful flat racing champion.

This book, which is considered to be one of his most important works, provided a detailed plan for a federal system in India that was based on the idea of giving each state its own autonomy and independence. Despite being the first person to propose such a plan, Aga Khan's idea was not widely adopted at the time, but it is still an important contribution to the discussion of India's political structure.", "Death_and_succession": "\n\n    At the time of his death on 11 July 1957, the Aga Khan, a prominent figure in the Shia Muslim Ismaili community, was succeeded as the Imam by his own grandson, Karim Aga Khan. The decision was made by the Aga Khan, based on his belief that the new Imam should be brought up and developed during the recent years and should bring a new outlook on life to the office. The Aga Khan was buried in the Mausoleum of Aga Khan, on the Nile in Aswan, Egypt, where he is remembered as a visionary leader who played a significant role in the development of the Shia Muslim Ismaili community.", "Legacy": " \"Aga Khan III is widely recognized for his philanthropic efforts and contributions to the global community.
