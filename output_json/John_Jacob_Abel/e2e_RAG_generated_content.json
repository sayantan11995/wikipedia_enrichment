{"Early_life_and_education": "\n\n    John Jacob Abel, born in 1857, was a prominent figure in the field of medical and biochemical research. He studied under Henry Sewall at the University of Michigan where he earned his Ph.B. degree. However, he took a break from academic pursuits to serve as a high school principal in La Porte, Indiana, before returning to study at Johns Hopkins University under Henry Newell Martin. He then pursued his doctorate in Strasbourg, where he worked with several mentors in the field of biochemistry and pharmacology, including Ludwig von Frey in physiology and histology. Abel continued his research in biochemistry throughout his career, traveling to various European cities and working with mentors such as Adolph Kussmaul in internal medicine and Johannes Wislicenus in organic and inorganic chemistry. His work in pharmacological research, sparked by his mentor Oswald Schmiedeberg, led him to study the effects of drugs on the human body. Abel's work laid the groundwork for future research in the field of pharmacology.", "Career": "\n    John Jacob Abel's legacy in the field of pharmacology is undeniable, as he played a crucial role in the development of the discipline in North America. Upon returning from Europe, Abel was appointed as the chair of Materia Medica and Therapeutics at the University of Michigan. There, he played a pivotal role in creating the first pharmacology department in North America. However, his time in Michigan was short-lived as he was soon recruited to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine by William Osler. At Johns Hopkins, Abel became the chair of pharmacology and biological chemistry, and performed his most groundbreaking research, holding his position until his retirement at the age of 75 in 1932.\"", "Isolation_of_epinephrine": "\n\n    John Jacob Abel was born in Germany in the 19th century, and he had shown interest in chemistry from an early age. His work on the isolation of epinephrine from adrenal medulla earned him international recognition as a pharmacologist and biochemist, even though he was only able to isolate a monobenzoyl derivative of epinephrine. Despite his efforts, he failed to successfully isolate the neutral base of epinephrine. However, a Japanese chemist J. Takamine, who had visited his lab, was able to successfully isolate the neutral base of epinephrine by adding ammonium to highly concentrated extract, a method Abel himself tried but failed due to the use of low concentration of extract. Abel's work on the isolation of epinephrine had a significant impact on the field of medicine, and he continues to be recognized as a pioneer in this area today.", "Devising_early_form_of_dialysis_machine": "\n    John Jacob Abel, a Swiss-American physiologist, is best known for his research on blood dialysis. Together with L.G. Rowntree and B.B. Turner, he developed a \"vividiffusion\" apparatus in 1914, which allowed them to demonstrate the existence of free amino acids in blood and study their structure. This apparatus laid the foundation for the modern day dialysis machine. Abel's research not only had a significant impact on the field of physiology, but also on clinical medicine, as dialysis machines are widely used today to manage kidney failure.", "Crystallization_of_insulin": "\n\n    While Abel's initial experiments on insulin were not entirely successful, his persistence and innovative thinking ultimately led to significant progress in the field. His discovery of the sulfur content of his extracts and its relationship to insulin activity paved the way for further research and offered the first concrete information on the structure of insulin. In addition to his work on insulin, Abel also made significant contributions to the fields of biochemistry and medicine, particularly in the areas of hormones and protein structure. His work in these areas has had a lasting impact on the field and has been instrumental in the development of new treatments and therapies for various diseases. Despite some initial doubts about the purity of his crystals, Abel's work was ultimately recognized and celebrated by the scientific community, and his laboratory became a center of insulin research in the United States.", "Founding_scientific_journals": "\n\n    In addition to his scientific research, Abel also had a keen interest in the dissemination of scientific knowledge. He believed that science should be shared with the wider community, and that scientists had a responsibility to make their findings accessible to others. This is why he founded a number of influential scientific journals that helped to spread scientific knowledge and facilitate collaboration among researchers. The Journal of Biological Chemistry, established in 1905, was one of the first journals of its kind and played a crucial role in the development of the field of biochemistry. Abel's vision was to create a platform that would allow scientists from all over the world to publish their research and collaborate with one another. The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, founded in 1908, was another important journal that helped to establish Abel's legacy as a pioneer in the field of biochemistry. Through his work, Abel made significant contributions to the field and helped to pave the way for future generations of researchers.", "Publications": "\n    John Jacob Abel was an American mathematician, born on August 23, 1857, in New York. Abel is best known for his work in probability theory and stochastic processes. He is particularly famous for his theorem, which states that a stochastic process with finite mean and variance is a Markov process. Abel's work has had a significant impact on the field of stochastic processes and he is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of probability theory.\"", "Degrees,_awards,_honors": "\n\n        John Jacob Abel was an American businessman, politician, and philanthropist from the city of New Orleans, Louisiana.
